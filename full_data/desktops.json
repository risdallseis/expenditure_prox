And might i say is a much better deal than just buying an upgrade bundle (cpu, ram and motherboard) the CPU inside can run most of the games on mid to high settings on 1080 p no problem. If you want to use it for high end triple A games, i would suggest getting a corsair ram bundle from 16 gb, cause 8 gb included wont be enough for newer AAA games.","It;s acceptable for browsing and videos. NOT for gaming, (unless you wanna play with minimum to medium graphic settings) since you need a much stronger video card and more expensive one.

I'm not new to gaming but I didn't have a very good pc beforehand and so most games didn't run very well. This PC is great!

But straight out of the box, I was surprised by how small it was, which is no means a bad thing at all; in fact, I love the size of it, as it fits right under my desk better than any other PC has in the past. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size also makes it very portable too, so I could take it to someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house very easily. Anyway, the day it came....I turned it on; went through the initialising settings, and boom, I was in and ready to go.  I purchased a newer version of a particular video-editing software (Vegas Pro 16), opened up an old project of mine, and straight away, I felt the difference in power and efficiency. With the amount of ram being double--and the graphics card's power also being double of that than my previous machine--I was able to have preview settings on max and enjoyed absolutely no lag or delay in feedback and frame-rate. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, even when some of the projects I work on get fairly complex and layered, there generally still tends to exist a consistent spare 50% of untapped memory usage; allowing me to really get stuck in and attempt more ambitious projects as I go along! This machine also does fairly well with some of the modern titles of today's video games, (e.g. Assassins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Creed: ODYSSEY plays very smoothly on high texture and lighting settings). All in all, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happier with my purchase, and I recommend this product to anyone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking for a budget computer with impressive specs.
