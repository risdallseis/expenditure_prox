It will not run Prime and have not tried Netflix. If you use google services it is good. Anything else and it does it badly. I do not recommend this.  It is basically an old phone with a keyboard.

This is not true as it's an app based system that needs an internet connection to function. In dispute with Argos as they refuse to refund","Excellent and lightweight. So portable","My Daughter needed a solution for college as her laptop was damaged. This is super light and really fast. The battery lasts about 10 hours. She is delighted as she has the app store, netflix, YouTube and the Google suite which basically means she has a tool for college, a leisure device and then able to keep in contact with her friends on social media apps.

The audio doesn't work with I disconnect Bluetooth. It needs to be restarted and browser cleared.","It's light and has an aluminium like plastic design. There is one USB C port on each side, the type of port which plugs into your phone so the laptop charger may double as a phone charger. One USB A port, the one for the flash drives, is on the left. There was a small gap between the touchpad and the clicking device, so when I tapped the touchpad there would be an annoying clicking noise. This very fast laptop sometimes crashed when I closed windows, and I am thinking of a return due to this.","The design is good and convenient for day to day use. I can recommend this product for personal use.","a very good Chromebook from asus I have been using it for a week with no problems all functions work and battery life is really good the chrome browser works just fine with multiple tabs open it works just as good as using a higher spec chromebook I have, the storage space is good and the expandable memory slot for micro sd works a treat I am using a 120 Gb card writing documents is a breeze the wifi connection is flawless and the chromebook runs the latest chrome operating system just fine","Brilliant little Cromebook bought for my daughter for school work does everything she could ever need and is a really handy portable size would highly recommend for the money","My programs on my last computer are not compatable with this one. \nMy radio show download is what i wanted it for now i cant do the show... should've stuck with windows!","This Chromebook is a blessing. I bought it mainly for my university work so I had something portable rather than my computer at home. It's so lightweight I can barely feel when it's in my bag. \n\nI won't be storing much on the laptop itself so I ignored all the other reviews about it lagging when documents and images are stored on it. I suggest people should buy a memory stick or use the cloud for that information as the memory isn't big. \n\nCheap and cheerful. You get what you pay for.","great for youtube and battery life great","Wanted a switch from Microsoft Windows but I found the operations on Google Chrome just as frustrating and wouldn't even connect to a printer with ease.

The Chromebook itself is thin, light and robust. The battery life is brilliant.  That's pretty much where the positives end for me. The chrome OS experience is terrible. Yes, you can install apps from the play store but I don't want to run touch screen optimised apps on a laptop with no touch screen. Viewing angles on the screen are dire. You can't get a balanced colour across the whole panel from any angle. Terrible.","Excellent size for portability, yet not too small - extremely light - works brilliantly - loads up in seconds, extremely fast - video streams are faultless - and it is superb for video calls. There is access to google play, so it is possible use various additional apps - including Microsoft word and outlook.

Highly recommended.","I used to have a MacBook Air which had terrible battery and a couple keys falling off after five years.\n\nThe pixelbook is affordable, sleek design, really light and incredible battery life. At the start a few apps e.g. netflix didn't work properly but that's all sorted now with as restart. Perfect for my needs (uni student)","Really good laptop.

Not a gaming powerhouse or video editing machine but perfect for my uses. If you are a techie who likes messing around with drivers\/patches this is not for you, but for people who just want to get stuff done this is ideal.\n\nBeautiful typing experience and all day battery life. A joy to use. I am so pleased I took a chance on Chrome OS. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want another bloated Windows ordeal and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t justify a Macbook. Very happy.","If you like Chromebooks you will love this Pixelbook Go. Slick design, great battery life, light weight and a touch screen. A 13\" screen is more than enough and the keypad feels really nice to work on.

Only problem is I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use my printer with it for some reason.","Best chromebook on the market. Was in two minds of choosing a chromebook or laptop and made the right decision. Instant start up, excellent battery, light up keyboard at night and so many more features. Took it away on holiday and played downloaded movies from amazon prime, Disney plus & Sky Go with seamlessly quality. Highly recommended.","If you're considering this or any Chromebook you should definitely know the pros and cons of running ChromeOS compared to Windows or Mac laptops. Once you've gone over that then if you don't mind paying a premium for Google hardware then look no further, this is the Chromebook to have. Super light, fantastic screen and speakers and great battery life. The m3 processor is not the fastest but is generally going to be fine for whatever you're going to do with it most of the time.","Although created by Google, I'm still amazed at how smooth this computer runs.\nThe collection was quite satisfactory.\nThe laptop came in an unbranded box which allowed me to safely transport it home.\nUpon opening the box I was delighted at its compact body & well organised interior. \nThe laptop itself is effortless. It took about 10 to 15 minutes to sort out the set as you'd expect. The laptop runs smooth & was in perfect order.

Despite the size, it is good","So far I am delighted with the surface go 2, I am not very savvy with laptops so it will take me a while to get used to it all. The screen looks amazing and the definition is excellent. So far a very satisfied customer","We have another computer but it is not very portable. So we wanted something else lighter but easily readable for Skype calls, web searches and handling emails. Saw a newspaper review rating this tablet as the best and in our experience it has performed really well. It operates in a scaled down version of Windows 10 though it can be changed to full if necessary...but we find it does all we need.

Looks great, so well designed mechanically and very fast. Boots up much faster than my HP i5 laptop and programs run just as fast if not faster. A Windows PC and a 10\" tablet in one, what could be better. To get the most out of it you need to use Microsoft cloud storage which I have for years. Excellent.","It has a good battery life","The tablet is very light but sturdy. Excellent quality both as a tablet or laptop (when paired with the type cover). I have been using it for simple tasks - browsing, documents and occasionally watching shows on Netflix. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an excellent portable tablet\/laptop especially for students like myself.

It takes a little to get used to a few differences, but its not difficult, even for myself, a novice. It is sleek, super fast, and the keyboard is lovely to type on.","Compared with other chromebooks the pixelbook go is on the more expensive side but in my experience you get what you pay for. Firstly straight out the box it has a feel of real quality. The full HD display is perfectly adequite for the screen size however you get a 4k screen with the i7 model. I was really impressed with the sound it's much louder than expected. The backlit keyboard is excellent and the hush keys really quiet.

The face recognition when logging in is incredibly quick, even in low light at an angle.\n\nThe battery life seems to be ok.  The only downer is the magnetic charger falls out too easily.  I use the USB C to charge with my Mac charger and it's much better.","This is my second Surface and it doesnt dissapoint for general useability.  The real test for me is how it handles photo editing via photoshop - time will tell.  The battery lasts about 5 hours which is for me a little dissapointing.

A little bonus is that the charger comes with a USB port so that you can charge your tablet and other portable devices at the same time.

When I got the laptop home I spent some time setting it up and then noticed it had a dead pixel (a black dot on the screen). I ran a few pixel fixer pages to try to sort it but it was dead so I rang Argos, took it back to a local store and exchanged it. The exchange was really straight forward and this laptop is perfect.

Super quick for browsing. Only drawback is when you are using multiple apps at a time, the fan kicks in and while this is really great for operating speed, it is super noisy!","I had to return. Battery life 5 hours not the advertised 8-10. Viewing angles weren't great and the fan kicked in far too often and was very loud. Tried everything to get it to run smoothly but I don't think the processor is powerful enough, base level 1ghz with 3.6ghz boost, my phone and replacement laptop with similar specs has 2.3ghz and they run like a dream. Started up in bios originally so unsure if mine was just a dud. It looks great and is very light but I would not recommend.","Bought 2 laptops in family. Perfect working and good value of money.","Very happy with this purchase.Exactly as described.","I Love my HP laptop! This is the second one I've owned.. the last one lasted for 7 years.

I tried to update driver software and also reinstalled os but nothing worked.

Great to use, opens quickly and no problems. Battery seems good. Happy so far after 2 weeks of usage.","As a previous HP owner I was really looking forward to my new laptop. However within a couple of hours I knew I'd be returning this machine. \nPros: looks great, thin, light, good spec and connectivity. The brushed metal finish is a nice touch.\nCons: needs 2 hands to open, no light on power or num lock keys, no back-lit keyboard, keys hard to read in low light, cheap plastic underside, loud fan, raised rim around the edge which cuts into your wrist whilst tying. Worst HP designed laptop.","I am very pleased with new Laptop.","My laptop is really worth the pay and very user friendly as required.The features are advanced and the lap is light weight which makes it more easy to carry.","Loved the look and slimline look very easy to use.","An excellent product that I use personally, not for business","Expected more but still fair compare to price","Its very noisy fan with no reason sometime, when you just boot up in cold state - the fan starts running for a while before it shuts off. For quad core processer with 8 Gig memory - its very slow in loading pages\/apps.

Small problem with computer logging off wi-fi intermittently but think i've sorted the issue. Otherwise fast, light and easy to set up and use. Would of liked 512GB hard drive but for the price i'd certainly recommend this laptop. Battery life seems ok but not owned long enough to assess.","I bought this for word processing and surfing the web. Great buy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleek, light, super fast compared to my old HP Pavillion laptop (2015 model). It literally takes seconds to start up. Soft touch keyboard so no irritating clicks every time I click the keys or mouse. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not into games so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that, but as a laptop for everyday use, it suits me perfectly.

She is delighted and very happy with every part of the laptop.","Nice clear screen. Good battery life. Not burdened with a load of pre-installed software that you don't want. Only slight criticism I would make is the keyboard legends are difficult to read in anything but bright light.

Modern design, full hd screen which is very clear and bright. Can run a little slowly but that's what you get with Intel.

It has a minimum set up and is ready to go in minutes. Operationally the lap top is very fast and has good internet response time.

The laptop is lightweight which is handy to travel with, despite my constant fear of being a klutz and accidently dropping it. It is weird going from a 14\" screen to a 16.5\" but that just adds to better viewing (with the great speed of an i5) during video calls and watching Netflix when you should really be working.

I even did it on my own.","Boots in about 12 seconds, is fast and very light compared to my 4 year old one.\n \nThe only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that after registering the new laptop with HP on 16th May 2020, I noticed the manufacturer's warranty expires 28th Dec 2020, which is only 7 months, not 12 months as advertised on the Argos website. I'm sincerely hoping that it's a mistake on HP's part and that I haven't been sold an item which has previously been returned to the store.","Really happy with this product If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m splitting hairs Then maybe the battery life could be better and start up a couple of seconds quicker and also come with windows office!

I has all the function and is affordable.","I purchased this as a laptop for keeping at home (i.e. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry it with me at all) and for personal admin and streaming films etc. It looks really nice, quite think indeed and has a lovely wide screen. The keyboard is a bit light but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me at all to be honest. I only had it for a few weeks and really like it. Not sure how much carrying it around would it take but if you just buy it for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd computer it is more than fitting.","Was looking for a sleek, light laptop and this fits the bill. So far so good. Easy to set up and  use.","love my laptop but I expect the best from Argos and thy never let me down","Starts up really fast bit touch pad isn't very responsive and battery ran out in just under an hour.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good solid laptop. Performs really well.","Quite a nice, smart looking laptop. We brought 2 of these for homeschooling the teenagers. \nFirst issue we had was a glitch with printing. we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the hp laptop to print in colour to our hp colour printer. Took about 4 hours to rectify the issues on calls with the helpline. \n2nd issue; on one of the laptops the screen keeps going dark even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on. Quite frustrating. Lost a day trouble shooting this issue.","I am very happy with the purchase, the Laptop is very thing and performs excellently. I am a little concerned about thermal management as the fan seems to work very hard periodically, but no actual issues there beyond being a little noisy. Overall I would recommend.","I bought this laptop two weeks ago after my old HP laptop broke down. This laptop feels great and is extremely responsive. You can clearly tell that its 10th Generation i5 processor is a massive improvement on previous models. I was very impressed by the slim line design of the laptop and was concerned that this might affect the solidity of its keyboard but I must say the keyboard is a threat to use and very responsive. Admittedly its early days yet but so far so good!!","Very slim. Very light. Great specification. Powers up very quickly. Does exactly what I need. Grab one of you can. You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed.","There are some small issues which other customers have referenced in that the fan can be noisy at times and the screen only tilted back to a certain point. I also found when I connected a CD\/DVD Drive (as this does not come as part of the laptop due to its portability), I found that the CD did not play music, however, I think this would have been the case with any Windows 10 laptop. These small issues aside, I cannot fault this product. It is super speedy and I would definitely recommend this.","It is a very nice laptop, quite light and comfortable when using\/typing. Only minor observations: the fan is a little loud as other reviews mention, the laptop feels 'all plastic', and you can fill up your SSD fast if you like to store everything. However, given the price, it is a very nice computer for home office work, videoconferencing, and running common streaming services. I'm happy with the purchase.","Price quality performance is good.I advise.","This has helped my grandson with his school work and his music. It is amazing","This has so far proven to be a good purchase.  The laptop loads quickly and the battery life is much better than many other laptops (with similar spec) that I've had in recent years.

Did lots of research to find a replacement up to the task and this fit the bill. Also allowed me to purchase for her to distance collect.","Excellent product and value for money fast and reliable product information readily accessible  fit for purpose","Great laptop really pleased with it","Bought this machine for my wife as she wanted to use it majorly for working on digital content. For the price it's doing a great job but could do with some features which is now standard on similar machines.\n\nA big minus is the sound of the fans when the processor is running high and sometimes the fan just starts running in the background even in sleep mode. Been using this since almost 3 months and except for the fan sounds I really don't have anything else to complain.","Good quality and good performance.","We needed something for the children to enable them to do their school work and keep up with their studies during the Covid 19 pandemic.

I must admit, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t regret it. I mostly use it to work from home and to browse the internet and it never failed me. Very fast. Once you press the switch on button it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on instantly and you can log on. Very good processor and I believe this processor can handle more than just browsing the internet. This computer is amazing to handle any multitaskers out there.","I am glad and happy that I bought this laptop because even though I am a beginner using computer, It is user friendly.","Laptop is great, turns on quickly, good quality graphics, easy to set up, fast and powerful and is ideal for basic computing and gaming.\nNot a big fan of Windows 10 but small price to pay for such a good laptop.\nBattery life is pretty average but does charge quickly.\nBiggest downfall of this laptop is its keyboard which is very basic and missing keys that you would usually find on a basic keyboard such as control key at the right side next to the arrows.\nOverall great product, happy","Very good for the price","The price i paid slightly higher than other retailers.

Even go as far as saying it outperforms much more costly options.\n\nDesign is great - minimal, slim and clean and doesn't feel cheap.\n\nThe only downsides - fan is fairly noisy (you get used to it), battery life is distinctly average and packed full of bloatware you're going to want to remove before you get cracking.","So I was going to invest on a laptop and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure exactly which one to go for. Although I had to travel a distance of this laptop. It is Leighton in weight barely notice in your bag.

However, performance seems excellent and start up is nice and quick.","I bought this laptop 3 weeks ago and I never regret of buying it I love it and  it works perfectly.","After an extensive review of different brands and there performance,design etc, the choice I made was the HP slim 15.6 i5 8gb Laptop.

My only gripe is the lack of dedicated physical left + right click buttons below the track pad. Using the integrated buttons on this laptop can be quite annoying and wrecks the click button experience for me.

It is great that he ca the attach and detach the keyboard. He adds they keyboard for school work and removes it when watching YouTube or playing games.\nThe battery has aong life which is also great.","Fab for my little girl (aged 10) for home schooling. Really light, easy to set up, although, I put her dob in and it restricted her youtube access to kids only, whereas we allow her to watch certain people on youtube. So, a tip! Make sure you use the correct dob when setting up, as you cannot change the settings after, other than resetting it all.\n\nGreat colour and the material back is perfect to avoid scratching.","Bought this for my young son to do home schooling on and to keep in touch with family during lockdown. However the camera isn't good - the colours are dull and can't seem to pick up any detail. Facebook Messenger doesn't work well (can't use the face filters which are apparently the most important thing!), and he struggles to get the device to sit at right angle for video calls so we've ended up using my computer for all video calling, which I wanted to get away from. Wish I'd paid the extra for an ipad as I know it would have been compatible with all apps he needed.","Great duel purpose tab with key board great quality from lenovo and very good price","Great laptop \/ tablet combo device.

Easy to navigate, intuitive, I'm so impressed!  I would rather like one myself.","Both my daughters like the Lenovo chrome book because it can be used as a computer and as a touch screen, as they put it. We are only charging the battery once a week at the current time. The only downside though is the charging lead is only 39 inch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long, so cannot be used when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charging. Overall, the girls like it for doing their school work.","This was bought for my 7yr old grand daughter for doing her online school work.  It has been a great success with her, were it had been previously been difficult on her tablet, on this she is doing fine and enjoying online schooling.  Additional we have a weekly Zoom meeting, were she enjoying using the Chat box making good use of the keyboard and improving her keyboard skill. Good webcam picture. It is a good compromise of Size and functionality.  Would recommend","Mostly impressed with this Chromebook. I bought them for the kids for lockdown and they are excellent for them. The fact that they are duel use as a standard laptop with a touch screen and removable keyboard to be used as a tablet is excellent and really intuitive for children to use and navigate. It handles Microsoft Office apps well, including Teams. They boot up quickly and naviaget between apps and web quickly and effortlessly. My concern is the screen, one cracked very easily with no hard or extensive activity - though to be fair, Lenovo have promised a refund. But should a screen get cracked by accident, it doesn't seem obvious how to fix or replace. Also the battery doesn't seem to be as excellent as advertised, it gets the kids through a school day, but then needs a recharge.","Really love this. Great as a laptop and as a tablet. Easy to use, dinky piece of equipment.","I purchased this Lenovo Chromebook as I wanted the functionality of a laptop but with the ease of a tablet. This has fulfilled that brief. It is very easy to use, very quick and responsive. The keyboard works well for a small keyboard. Tactile and responsive with physical clicks. The pleasant surprise for me was that I hadn't realised that Chromebook is run on Google platforms. So there are several shortcuts that. You place in the search browser and that connect directly to that website. Like for instance nce Google Photos. I would say I have had difficulty at times connecting to the Play store. I haven't really sorted this yet. I can connect but it involves me clearing the cache etc. My Chromebook has also auto updated x2 which works well. So overall I'm very pleased with what Lenovo have produced. It comes at a very reasonable price tag too.","Awesome, classroom app should be updated to allow hand raising","I was torn between getting a new tablet or a small laptop for using as a secondary device for some light work, browsing and streaming etc. I then came across this Chromebook which looked like the best of both worlds - which is exactly what it is! I can use it in it's tablet mode for when I'm relaxing but it also works great as a secondary laptop when I'm working.\n\nIt's more than fast enough for what I need, and has had no trouble running multiple apps and tabs. Even played the odd sneaky game on it which has been great. Only criticism, and it's a very minor one, is that the keyboard is very compact so some users may find it a bit cramped. However, I got used to it after a few days' use.\n\nOverall, would highly recommend for anyone looking for a Chromebook, or even a mid-range tablet with a handy keyboard included!","I purchased this tablet for my son and he loves it. He is in kindergarten and is playing educational games as well as entertaining himself. I installed Google's Family Link so that I can limit his screen time and control the apps his installs. I love it how you can install many Android apps, this is a killer feature.","For the money, an extreamly very well balanced machine in terms of its hardware spec and performance. I personally would have liked a better wifi range, but that's a minor gripe. The Chrome OS software can appear a little clunky and limited if, like me, you're used to Windows. But it does the basic stuff (browsing, video, small documents) very well indeed.","Nice easy laptop to use. Disconnects easily. Have to buy micro soft separately","The tablet comes very handy for zoom calls, meetings and browsing.","I bought this for my son school work. It was easy to set up and we loved the transition between being a laptop\/tablet.","An affordable, portable, convertible gateway to online working. Can play android games as well.\nProcessor looks weak on paper but haven't faced any hiccups so far.\nKeyboard felt really cramped at first but got used to it later. Actually, the keyboard included in the price seals the deal.","Bought it for a small project; using Google Workspace for email, docs etc so as a cheap ChromeOS tablet it fits the bill nicely.","I had a hard time choosing which tablet would provide everything I needed for my university work, but I can honestly say this is a great product that enables me to access my work and is light enough to carry around campus. Its easy to feel like you need to purchase a samsung or ipad but this honestly provides you with the same if not more efficent and relevant apps\/design for student life. An amazing all in one for work and for lesuire!\n\nThe loadup time is fast for lectures\/seminars and the functions are very convienient for general student habits\/needs. Would recommend for any student (especially university student) who doesn't want to carry a heavy laptop to classes. \nAlso I do recommend getting a cheap styllus pen for it at first (which is what I currently have) and then upgrading to the proper styllus pen- makes annotating PDF articles and writing notes 10 times easier. Also don't worry about having the largest memory space as you don't really use it all, plus if you use google docs (which I recommend if your a student) then its already there. \n\nAlso great for lesuire activities such as Netflix, etc. If your into editing the photoshop lightroom app works well on here too.","Easy to use,  charges quickly and does everything a a working person could need it for","Sadly the mmi is cumbersome. I know that the stupid idea to control any computer with 'intuitive' characters - when the whole world can read - was complete stupidity. To set up controls that could mean anything, whilst a word or two that pop up cannot be mistaken. An 'intuitive' symbol or a swipe of the finger in any direction is basically guesswork. Impossible to do anything constructive without a manual permenantly at your side. Ok to watch films. Seemingly lacking a volume control","Not a powerhouse by any means but still very good!","Ultimately I bought this to be used as a ChromeOS tablet, and it performs very well.  I have used it as a laptop and it also works well, although the keys are a little cramped for me. I am contemplating buying one for my son and I don't think he'd have any issues with the keyboard.\n\nIt's performed well with all apps I've tried. Personally I think the google apps (gmail, drive) work better in the browser than the android apps, but it gives you both options, so you can see which works better for you.\n\nOverall a very good product for a good price.","Really nice feature set. \nPros: \n- pen input\n- battery life\n- compact and convertible\n- features \/ price ratio\nCons:\n- a bit on a heavy side with keyboard and cover\n- keys are small for adults to do prolonged typing \n- no bundled stylus\n- no native Zoom app","Really enjoying it. Just what I was looking for i.e. something easy to use, turns on fast, allows me to do 95% of what I want and with a really long battery. I do have to say the screen is really AMAZING. Cannot believe it for this price.","This is an inexpensive tablet that also has a separate keyboard. Mainly good but reservations over how long the attachment of keyboard to screen will last. Also the stand needs a thumb nail to separate it from the backing. Finally check out the warranty date because mine said 1970 and therefore had no warranty!! Had to contact customer services to correct this. It's in FAQs so not isolated issue.","So easy to use and versatile.  I am not good with technical stuff, but found this easy to use.","The tablet struggles to run clash of clans, not something i bought it for but something that i expected it to do. You also suggested buying a mouse with it which i did and the darn thing isnt compatible with the tablet. That frankly enrages me.","Got this for my sister starting Uni. Easy to set up, quick response and generally working well. The only thing i would say is it is a lot heavier than it looks! But its compact so can be taken anywhere.","Good bit of kit for the price. Easy to use; like the magnetic clip mechanism to the keyboard.","Exactly as described, perfect for school and social","Light and powerful. I am so happy with this purchase!\nI needed a compact laptop for my writing and checking emails on the go: you can't go wrong with this one! The keyboard included is great also.\nOf course, it's more like a tablet with features, not a proper laptop, but if this is the use you need, simply perfect.\nLast thing: Battery lasts sooo long!","This is a super device for the price - screen bright and sharp, speakers well adequate for such a small device, battery life phenomenal, able to run Android apps (as well as Chrome OS can - so it can be patchy but is getting better every day). So - as a tablet for consuming media, playing the odd game, a steal at the price. But the benefit is the included keyboard, admittedly small, but it means that it can serve as a device you can take with you anywhere to turn around emails, do some regular work, which is my intended purpose. You do need to understand it is Chrome OS, not Windows or Mac, but as long as you are comfortable with that there is no reason not to buy this device for the above uses.","Great little chrome book at a great price for our boy who is loving the versitility - great for school and a little fun too.  Running fast, great screen and tough cover.","Been looking for a tablet and having seen reviews and media of this new tablet decided to wait for its release in UK. Was looking forward to receiving and using. However, I find the tablet is not responsive. It seems to hang. even simple tasks like opening an app. actually opening outlook now its just whirling. not impressed.","Good product, keyboard compact, connects effortlessly to screen. The back cover is quality material and allows you to sit the tablet\/keyboard on your lap or table top however you choose to use the product it's versatile and light to carry around.","Absolutely love this Chromebook, really compact and lightweight for carrying to university. Battery lasts me for days but I can use my phone usb charger if it were to run low. It is also incredibly cheap especially considering it comes bundled with keyboard which would be another \u00c2\u00a3100+ if this were an Apple or Microsoft product","This is a superb piece of kit. Super fast and battery life is amazing","I already have an Asus - flip c302 Chromebook so this is an extra I have mainly used it as a tablet but it's useful to have the keyboard if you are thinking about getting one just do it","This is my first ever tablet; i've never found them useful or likely overpriced toys for kids. However i got this and for it's price, it's been a good bargain. \nOnly downside is poor documentation on how to really use the smart unlock feature (very useful), and lack of a curated list of supported pen's\/styluses for this device has lenovo is well behind their own timeline to create one.\n\nI've mostly used it to read tech blogs and will be using the linux bundle to tunnel to cloud instances","This Chromebook was the perfect match for my usage, as a bedside media consumer and news reader , due to it's small form factor ,it also serves as a great travel companion with the bonus of the full Chrome desktop browser & with all the Playstore office productivity apps I need to get jobs done . I use a number of Linux tools , like Gimp & Pycharm and this CB seems to handle them very well , plus it supports flatpak which I didn't expect .\nI would have given it a higher rating had it not been for the Kodi playstore app not constantly crashing  which it didn't do on my other previous Chromebooks , but by far this is the best valued Chromebook I have ever bought","Disappointing, bought to replace Android tablet and ageing Windows PC. In Tablet mode some important Android apps don't work (The Times and Sunday Times, NowTV). In Chromebook mode my files stored in MS onedrive are easily accessible by Google \ndocs etc but can only be saved to Google drive, requiring me to manually copy them back to MS storage There's also some conflicts with Android Google apps and the corresponding Chromebook Web apps. Drive Gmail etc, ie it doesn't know which one to use. Google accounts are also a mess, I have 2 Google accounts, the Android apps let me switch between accounts but I have to create 2 Chromebook accounts and login and out between them to access my files. I suppose these are more Google problems than Levono issues, but the whole thing is a Dogs breakfast. In addition the fabric stand supplied has started fraying. I'd recommend buying a Chromebook and a separate Android tablet, just like the Google slate, the ChomeOS is a complete fail","Swapped a Microsoft surface go for this and am not disappointed. The surface is all style over substance, where this just does what you want it to without fuss or delay.","Lives up to the general acclamation - very good indeed for the price. For me this replaces an iPad bought in 2017 (so a couple of models ago) and while it is not quite as snappy in all areas as the iPad it more than makes up for it (for me) in versatility. The included but removable keyboard is a huge asset, obviously not great for extensive typing but excellent for lighter use. And the ability (coming from Chrome OS, not this particular hardware) to run programmes like Gimp through a built-in virtual machine makes this a clear winner over the iPad. Build quality is excellent and the screen is very nice.","Does everything I hoped it would. So much less expensive than competitors products. Maybe not the ultimate performer on paper compared to some others, but does all that I need it to do, and more.\n\nBright & clear screen, keyboard is small but well formed, easier to use than I expected - just wish it had Home and End keys, but maybe there are shortcuts I don't know about. I haven't had the product long, there is perhaps more to discover, e.g there is only one port - but so far I  haven't needed more, but that may change - but USB expansion units are available for not a lot of money.\n\nOnly problem I have had so far is there only a quick start guide, and no user manual available. This is pretty bad, but maybe it will appear soon (it is a new model to the UK after all).","Fabulous  machine. Just a shame there is no stock and there are no cases available to protect it.","We're delighted with our new Lenovo Duet, everything about it is good (screen, keyboard, responsiveness, start-up time, wake-up time, battery life, sound, price). If only it had been released a little earlier in the UK, I would have bought two (having bought another tablet only a couple of weeks beforehand). I would recommend to anyone considering a portable tablet device, and especially if a keyboard is a desirable feature - absolutely excellent.","Cool product, why buy iPad it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far better with the keypad as well. As you can see I rate this product.","It's an excellent Chromebook, nice build quality. Pactical use and a game changer. Love my Lenovo!","Had 3 weeks. Hasn't missed a beat. This model is THE winning formula. \nPlease do the same trick again Lenovo.","Excellent quality and great value for money! Bought for my daughter for starting secondary school. Will be able to do all she wants and can still play games!","Very nice tablet and the best customer service....","Bluetooth does not work, screen dim, keyboard poor","The screen has a dead pixel. Unbelievable for a brand new product. Where's the quality check?","great little kaptop\/tablet very good battery lite, good performance, like the keyboerd just wish it was backlit keys, easy to remove and atatch kickstand is easy to use and works well while balanced on your knee, good bright screen, like everything about this cromebook\/tablet would recommend this to anybody that`s thinking of buying it.","Well done Lenovo.\nThe Chromebook Duet shows you fully understand what customers want - a brilliant looking \/ performing \/ priced device - that INCLUDES extras like keyboard & kickstand.\nI'm sure your competitors are panicking - they should be!\nThis is a fantastic device at an incredible price - just buy it.","Value for money, affordable, quality item. I can do a lot on this chromebook.","Very good as a 2nd device. Performance is fine as long as you don't have a lot running. Crashes a lot though which is irritating. Hopefully it will stabilise once more updates come through","The Chromebook\/ Android tablet I have been waiting for. It ticks all the boxes for portability\/design \/functionality\/etc etc. I use it as my take out and about device when working as well as being my go to device when at home.","Amazing value for money does everything I need it to so easily and a great addition for in-between phone and laptop!","Expectations very high after watching YouTube reviews but unfortunately it has not lived up to the hype on several counts. The good is the physical aspects of just the tablet, its bright, light, and good looking. The poor is the keyboard magnetic fitting then sometimes need realigning when fitting and the heavy back cover\/stand. The bad is the performance when trying to use it with drawing program Krita with slow performance and complete hangups. Overall Dissapoined even taking into account the reasonable price","I decided to get a chromebook as my existing android tablet was 6 years old. The lenovo duet fitted the bill as it was small, cheap & something new to play with in lockdown. This was to be a test toy to try a chromebook before getting a larger more powerful model. However I've really enjoyed learning on it, the keyboard is amazing for the size & price. I love the screen brightness & usually have it less than half unless I go into the garden when full works in the sun. I've loaded Linux to use GIMP, a half day experience, but then I don't use Linux. I even bought the pen (by the brown sauce maker ;-)) & that works well. I'd have bought the Lenovo pen but it hadn't been released. The only thing I had a problem with was the screen got a faint pinkish hue across half of it 3 times, it went away on reboot but Lenovo suggested a power wash, which I did with trepidation. All went well but I had to reload Linux & Gimp, luckily I'd put how to in GKeep so that was a lot quicker. Overall a lovely small portable computer & I haven't touched my tablet (or PC) in the 3 weeks I've had the Lenovo duet. A great little computer","One of the best value, best performing Chromebooks I've used for a while","This is probably the perfect device for most people. I've sold my iPad in preference to using this device. It's at a great price point and runs great.","This is a very nice piece of kit and very reasonable price.it does exactly what it says on the tin. Unfortunately I have marked it down to a 3 star rating because after 1 week of owning it whilst carrying it the magnets holding the keyboard and the back board released the main tablet and it dropped onto the floor and smashed the screen beyond repair. I do feel that if the magnets were stronger this would not have happened. This is a warning to people because i would happily try another but be very aware of this design weakness.\nIf this was not there i would have given it 5 stars no problem."],"79":["I brought this 6 weeks ago and so glad I did. Excellent value for money","This slimline chromebook does everything I need it to, it's super light and very quick","I bought this product and it is very easy to use and basically I am very satisfied with it.","Delivered on time. It has a good sized screen, standard display and speakers buts thats ok. Good sized keyboard that feel solid to type on. The trackpad feels very good. The 360 flip in effect turns the device into a 14\" tablet, which surprisingly works very well. It's a little heavy to use as a tablet for a long time, but the screen can be used at at angle to suit you. Chromebook features high processing, long battery life, and no fans (never over heats). Low storage (64GB) but thats ok with extended storage and cloud services. A great, solid, clever device at a steal of a price.","Very nice good  beautiful","Recently we bought this product and am really satisfied and Refered one of friend also planning to buy she","Very easy set up, imported all my files from my phone with ease."],"80":["I am verry happy with this laptop .

Nice AMD processor, very fast and good","Definitely underrate product from Lenovo, best choice I ever made, go for it!","Lenovo Legion 5 with AMD 5800H is the one of the most powerful laptops on the current market.

I have made some 70 adjustments to Windows 10 to reduce battery and processor loading. Battery at full charge states 18 Hours and 15 minutes. In a test today 21st June 2021 running video music clips continuously the battery lasted 10 hours.\n\nBoot time is slightly slower than a normal i5 10th Edition. Screen, weight and build quality are excellent. A point to note is that Samsung has added some apps like updates, Samsung cleaner, etc that are actually very good.","I brought few weeks ago and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very happy about this laptop and also their service from Argos it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more safe with them then others sites online","The galaxy book S is amazing and matches all my samsung devices fits right in the eco system! The earthy gold is slightly different shade but doesn't bother me, the interior of laptop should've been same as outer.\n\nThe only issue I've had with this laptop is ambient keyboard lighting; when it doesn't let you turn on keyboard backlight manually and decides when its dark enough for it to turn on, however once you get used to it is an incredible little machine.\nI was able to successfully run virtual machines on the i5 model.","I thought I was saving hard and getting a quality product, how wrong can someone be, I've always had samsung phones, monitors, and TVs so thought it was a good idea to push the boat out and buy a samsung laptop, although I couldnt afford the dream samsung laptop this ticked all the boxes and I'd read good reviews and recommendations,  for the short period of time i used it, it was good, but to experience the blue screen of death after only 5 weeks and about 6 uses is disgraceful, I tried the back up however 5 hours later its saying its finished but the external drive is showing it still has full capacity and we are back to the blue screen of death and we are back in the vicious circle of so we risk a factory reset and lose hours of work, well back to the ipad and phone to try and redo my work, my faith in samsung products has severely diminished and I will be looking at other manufacturers for my new phone this year","I love the design, it's so sleek and is very easy to carry around. I had no issues with set up and I now use this laptop every day, for most of the day.","First impressions of the laptop were great, really solid feel yet still light as a feather. It really has a premium look and feel to it.\n\nWhen starting to use the laptop it was a little disappointing, first boot into windows it felt so laggy and CPU locked at high 80%+ utilisation, I think this was down to a whole load of windows updates but still it wasn't a great first impression.\n\nNow its settled down it is a fast and snappy little machine, boots fast and loads everything needed quickly. It has no issues with emails, videos and general web browsing which I assume is what this machine would be used for most people. I haven't tried yet but I think it would work well word processing and spreadsheets.\n\nI'm very impressed with the screen and speakers. The 1080p screen is so clear in this small form factor, videos and websites look great. Touchscreen is faultless. The sound is also excellent, way better than anything I used before.\n\nFinal note to mention is on the Intel i5 Lakefield CPU this laptop comes with. This is brand new technology and to me I don't think it has yet been fully optimised for Windows. I'm hoping performance can continue to improve with future updates from Windows and Intel.","Had mine for almost a month now. The best features would have to be the screen, weight and size. Absolutely gorgeous touchscreen and goes up to 650nits at max, maybe? It is also fanless so you don't have to worry about even the slightest noise. Extremely portable and a delight to use. \n\nHowever, it is not ideal for demanding tasks. Intel designed a CPU that is horrendously underwhelming in performance despite it being their most innovative CPU in a long time. Not to mention that the Intel version's battery life cannot even hold a candle against the ARM version. Not Samsung's fault. I wish it had a built-in LTE though.","So I used this in a store and watched some online reviews. This really is a beautiful machine.\n\nThe first thing you notice is the design, it is absolutely stunning. There is no question that Samsung has nailed the design, it's super light and user friendly!\n\nI can't really comment on the performance as I didn't use it for long, but as I have had a long list of Samsung phones and tablets I can safely say I am confident they will have got it right. In the small amount of time I used it, the performance was smooth and snappy. It woke up, opened programs and moved pretty quickly.\n\nThe typing experience was really good, I enjoyed using the keys.\n\nThe screen was typical Galaxy a d was out of this world.\n\nI am going back to university this year and would love to take this laptop to help with my studies. I would recommend it!"],"103":[""],"104":[""],"105":[""],"106":[""],"107":["I needed a new laptop and decided to get this one and I can say I'm very happy with the huawei matebook 14 fast great look brilliant build love the screen and the finger print is really good I would say to anyone that huawei make 100% top quality products."],"108":["Extremely pleased with this laptop on all fronts (low noise, low heat, speed and graphics) I use it for gaming , work (video editing)  and financial data crunching.

For everyday use (principally using a browser) the machine is great. The screen is a good size and very comfortable, as is the keyboard. The machine uses a Qualcomm chip and is Windows on ARM. This means the battery lasts for ages and you can switch it on and off like a phone rather than doing a windows power-down and then having to wait to boot up. Potential buyers should remember though that windows on ARM does not run many traditional apps and drivers so you need to be sure that it is for you. Having said that, I have loaded full Photoshop, and, whilst not lightening fast, if functioned fine. All in all a very good day to day machine if you want to browse the web and use Microsoft's Office apps. There are increasing numbers of apps which are being written to run on ARM natively (eg photoshop and acrobat) and a native Zoom client is in the works. Against my limited expectations at the price, I am extremely pleased, hence this review to encourage anyone who might be interested but bitten in the past by cheap PCs which were unusably slow: this is not one of those machines, I for one, am very happy."],"143":["Performs well and it does what I need it to do, the only thing I would improve in this is the built in speakers","As of yet amazing product swift performance and battery life.

This turned out to be perfect in price and well as functionality. Does everything it needs to in regards of school work. Screen is clear and bright and very easy to set up. Really happy and would recommend.","My first Chromebook. All seems good at this point.","My new laptop is brilliant for the money!

Battery life is very good. It took a while to getting use to the Google OS chromebook system but once you've used it for few days its simplicity is much welcomed. It lacked a crisp HD screen but its usable and more than makes it up with its fast performance. Overall it's good value for money if you're only interested in browsing the internet and the odd skype call.","Great bit of kit at great price","Bought for my partner following recent sight problems. The 14 inch screen is a big improvement on her eight inch tablet and she loves it.","I bought this as a replacement for an older friend who was struggling with an old laptop.\n\nThe setup and subsequent easy to use OS have given my friend a valuable link to the outside world as she has to stay at home.\n\nFor general internet use this machine is fast and you do not need to worry about backup or computer viruses and no annual licensing fees\n\nFor all those looking for simple portable personal computing chrome books as well worth considering.","You won't get a better chromebook for the price, and it seems well made.\nAdd a top class delivery from argos in these difficult times, and you can't go wrong.","Light, looks great, easy to set up and operate. Was purchased for school work during lockdown!","Great product would recommend","When schools closed we bought Acer chrome books for two of our grandchildren. It was great for the younger one, easy to use, simple to connect to school, and ideal for all his needs but wasn't suitable for the elder one.The second one will be returned when we are able. This isn't a reflection on the chrome book simply our lack of understanding of the different requirements of our grandchildren. We purchased a HP laptop from you for the older one, which is proving ideal and is reviewed elsewhere","There's a whole range of Chromebooks out there at different price points - this one is at the cheaper end of the scale, but does the job perfectly well. All Chromebooks take a bit of getting used to for a traditional PC user, but they work well and are a good purchase for kids at school, especially if you're on a budget.","Easy to use, very quick, great value","Easy to use for my studies and portable. Simple design, and long battery life.Would recommend!","I have not received the item as yet!\nPossibly because of the virus situation.","Great for web browsing and for doing everything Google. Had many a Zoom meeting over the lock down period without a hitch.  Kids used it to access Google classroom for home schooling,no problems. \nThe USB C charging is a plus as our phones are the same so less cables!","Really pleased with my purchase,  not too expensive , is sleek and lightweight, battery life fantastic.","The laptop is great for the money. Getting used to the Google set up took a bit of time & the track pad isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as touch sensitive as my more expensive laptop, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine for the job & my daughter prefers a plug in mouse anyway.  Amazing service from Argos. We were about to go into lockdown & my daughter needed a laptop for her schoolwork. Ordered online & picked up the next morning at our local Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Fab all round!","Great laptop does exactly what I need it for best purchase this year","This was bought for my kids to do schoolwork on. It is quick and easy to use, much faster and more portable than our old laptop. Nice to type on and easy to navigate. Kids enjoy playing some games on it too, but obviously not hardcore gaming.","Great for my daughter to do her homeschool work on. \nReally good battery life, light to carry and easy to set up. \nGood price too!","Ideal for the kids to do school work","easy to use and lightweight","Really pleased with this laptop and the battery life is particularly impressive.","Great for general internet browsing or social media use. Looks a little chunkier than in the photos but is still light and easy to carry around. Excellent battery life, if you are browsing then charging the laptop is the last thing you have to worry about! Speakers aren't amazing but they do the job, though the location of them is frustrating as if you have the laptop on your lap the sound is muffled.","This Chromebook is a great price for what you get. It looks great, is very smart and clean looking but is also very functional. Its lightweight and easily portable so wouldn't weigh a bag down if you were to carry It around all day. As a Chrombook it does have limited functions but it does run fast and work smoothly with what it offers. At a very affordable price, this item is worth the money and would be good for a child at school or simple day to day work.","I had always thought the chromebook was just a laptop style Web browser and media player, but this is not true. I was able to read and edit Office documents, play games from Google Play as well. The battery life was good too, circa 9 hours.","Neat and light, easy to set up, silent in operation - no fan noise as on Windows laptops, no bloatware - all those irritating free trial offers contaminating your hard drive are absent. Streaming video without a flicker on a bright and colourful screen and a battery that just keeps on giving. A pleasure to use and enjoy. Excellent!","This laptop is easy to set up and perfect for storing photos, web surfing and emails. \nThe screen size is good and nice and clear.\nI found it easy to navigate, very lightweight ( so good for travelling) and a nice slim design.\nMy favourite thing was the absolutely amazing battery life.","I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any experience of a Chromebook but now feel it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a definite winner. Familiarisation and set up was quick and simple and is well explained on paper and on screen. The machine is light enough to transport and use, the mouse pad is suitably sensitive and easy to operate and the screen is clear.\nI can speed through spreadsheets and documents with ease but also find it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great for downloading and using apps and games. I would strongly recommend this product.","This Chromebook replaced a windows laptop as a student I needed something reliable after lost of reading reviews and looking at specs I choose this and I'm so glad I did this I find so much easier to navigate and the battery life is incredible. I use it for research; essay writing also the odd Netflix film; it handles this with ease. You can also use google docs offline which is handy if wifi is weak.\nVery please would strongly recommend I don't know I'm carrying it around as it's so light"],"182":[""],"183":[""],"184":[""],"185":[""],"186":[""],"187":[""],"188":[""],"189":[""],"190":[""],"191":[""],"192":[""],"193":[""],"194":["This is the first time I bought a higher spec laptop, I should have bought GL laptop long time ago as I know that LG is quality. Slim, light, excellent battery life, easily last me 3 days before I need to recharge the batteries, and excellent tips how to make the battery last longer. I love everything about it, and it is class !! Was a pleasure just opening the box !!\nThere are laptops then there is LG. Thank you.","This laptop has a nice sleek design and is slim and lightweight. It's perfect for working on the go. The battery life is incredible and I can easily get through a day's work on the one charge.\nDespite the small size this is a powerful laptop with some great features. The screen is bright and crisp. The inbuilt speakers are nice and clear and great for watching tv shows and movies. The mic has good pick up and the inbuilt webcam is perfect for Zoom meetings.\nThe power button is also a fingerprint sensor which is a nice bonus and makes for a quick log on. This powerhouse of a laptop has no problems with multitasking, it's responsive and has no issues with lagging. A fantastic all round laptop!","Love this powerhouse of a machine! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so light which makes it very versatile for using on the go, with great connectivity for using in the home office too, meaning this laptop is replacing my desktop and Lenovo business laptop. \nSpeedy to turn on and off making it a lot easier to work or watch films on the train, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so light you hardly realise you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re carrying it. With Bluetooth and headphone jack you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re good to go, with a great inbuilt speaker for at home. Mainly used it for CAD and web browsing so far today and i still have 11.5h of battery life left, amazing! Would 100% recommend.","From the initial unpacking of the branded white box, I was already thinking nothing was inside! The body is extremely lightweight, has a modern and sleek finish in an aluminium style body. Opening the lid, you are presented with a full 14-inch screen and a nicely designed keyboard\/mousepad layout. Boot up was incredibly fast (less than 5 seconds after first setup), Cortana talks you through the initial setup and you are ready to go in under 10 minutes. \nWith fingerprint recognition (a nice touch!), incredibly clear, responsive keys, tactile and accurate at speed. The speakers (full immersive crystal sound on music and on Skype\/Zoom calls) are on the underside along with large rubber feet, again a good design feature as stops the laptop from sliding. The webcam is very unobtrusive and has a light to indicate in use. All USB\/SD\/HDMI\/LAN\/power ports are set towards the back of the keyboard on both sides rather than the centre, again useful when working from an external drive without any cables getting in the way.\nScreen is clear on video calls as well as typing, with very little flare\/reflection and uses the maximum screen size, with minimal edging. You will need to purchase a Microsoft package for office packages if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already have one. All preinstalled programmes (even Alexa is installed) worked without hitch and after using for a full day and a half on documents & spreadsheets found the battery life to far exceed others. The power brick design is smooth and rounded, fitting easily into a travel bag.\nOverall, in my opinion a great lightweight laptop that is smart in appearance, holds good charge, with fast start up and excellent for travel.","The laptop is incredibly light with a sleek modern design. Bonus features include a light up keyboard, a silicon key board cover to protect from spills, crumbs and dust, Alexa enabled and fingerprint security feature. The screen's colours and  brightness are fantastic, very crisp images. The processing speed in this laptop is amazing. From hitting the power button I can be online in less than 10 seconds. I've installed several games which struggle on my desktop PC but run amazingly on this. Battery life is also excellent lasting up to 9 hours per charge and that's with gaming usage. Overall I would highly recommend this product for someone who is looking for a laptop to use on the move, its smaller and lightweight design makes it easy for transporting but with absolutely no compromise. An amazing all rounder.","The first thing you notice with this laptop when you pick it up is it is extremely lightweight and surprisingly robust making this product ideal for home, traveling to work and I think students would also benefit from the portability making it a great allrounder.\nThis is a 14-inch screen and the pixel density is solid resulting in an exceptionally good resolution\nIncredible battery life I got 3 to 4 days with light use before needing to charge, a generous size touch pad and I think the three levels of backlight on the keyboard is a nice touch. The power sleep button is also a fingerprint scanner this has worked every time that I have used it over the past week, and I have not needed to input my password.\nThe webcam is sufficient for zoom meetings which in this day and age is a necessity. All in all I have enjoyed using this laptop and I would highly recommend it to anyone considering purchasing a new laptop.","A fantastic, super thin and lightweight laptop! The screen is sharp, bright and colourful, and has next to no bezel-perfect for videos on the go. Battery life easily exceeded ten hours on a full charge for standard usage. Came with a little bloatware out of the box, and Windows needed a ton of updates but nothing unexpected. Unfortunately the onboard Iris xe graphics chip isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite enough to play games at settings that make the most of the screen, but scaling down to 720p and medium-ish settings I managed to play Fortnite, Rocket League and GTAV with steady frame rates, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure with a little tweaking they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have looked even better. Plenty of ports on the sides- 2 USB-3, 2 USB-C\/thunderbolt, an HDMI and micro SD slot. Even includes a headphone port, though can sync with Bluetooth devices too. Fingerprint sensor on the power button so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to remember your PIN(just your fingers!). All in all a great laptop- perfect for work applications and an ideal travel companion!","This is easily the lightest laptop I have ever used, which makes it so convenient for me to pop in my handbag and use whilst on my commute. Despite it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly smaller size, the screen feels large and the picture is perfectly clear. The battery life has also surprised me, with the laptop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first charge lasting almost two full days. For what I use it for, the quality of the audio and camera have been ok, but the resolution of the camera could be better. I love the addition of the fingerprint sensor when logging on, but did take me a while to figure out this was located on the power button. I would definitely recommend this laptop, particularly to those who prioritise lightness, quietness and battery life.","Despite its light weight and thin profile, this laptop feels robust and strong. \n\nOut of the box, this laptop is easy to set up, cortana takes you through the set up, which takes just a matter of minutes.  One stumbling block was in setting up the fingerprint. I simply did not know where the sensor was. A quick Google though and I found it was integrated into the power button, which is very neat!. \n\nI love the built in Alexa function allowing you to ask Alexa for things and even control your smart home functions through the Alexa app or via voice control. \n\nThe 14 inch screen is clear and bright although I haven't tested it in bright sunshine yet.  The keyboard is lovely and the buttons clear and decisive. The only minor issue I found was the slightly smaller return button, than my previous laptop, but I think that is something I will quickly get used to. \n\nI have a Microsoft 365 subscription already, so I was quickly able to start work on the laptop and it was responsive in all apps.  If you haven't got 365, you will need to purchase this to be able to use the office suite of software. \n\nThis is the perfect laptop to travel around with me for work as its light, neat and fully capable of meeting day to day demands. \n\nAll in all a great functioning laptop in a very smart and neat little package","My 1st impression - customer-focused design. You get a 14-inch screen with a long-lasting battery but without being cumbersome. This powerful monster is unbelievably lightweight for its performance. Letters on the keys were bigger. Responsive keys and touchpad. Built-in speakers are located on the underside, therefore, you can raise the volume without affecting mic feedback causing echo which usually annoys listeners. The USB slots and HDMI were on the farther end so you can use a wired mouse or USB stick without affecting the position of your arm. The closer the elbow to my body, the better for me. Multiple tabs and browsers, multiple documents and spreadsheets - no issues at all, no lag, thanks to the 8Gb RAM. I have replaced my trusted 14-inch laptop with this, same specs, but LG Gram got my attention for the well-thought-through design. Smaller bezels mean smaller dimensions overall but you still get the screen size that you need. The fan noise is negligible. The camera produced great quality video, albeit, a little washed-out when facing direct sunlight, not a big issue in my own personal opinion. Microphone pick-up was great. The screen colour is vibrant.  In my consumer opinion, I can't find any reason not to love this laptop. Added bonus ... Alexa has another friend.","This laptop is great it is extremely light weight which makes traveling with it easy.   The speed of the laptop is very good never felt that it struggled to keep up with anything I was doing. The feature of the LG control is very good for basic setting changes, this also keeps your system upto date for you with patches and even bios updates. \nI would highly recommend this laptop if you want a great laptop that you can easily travel with."],"195":["It might catch the eye visually but the performance doesn't say that, sometimes it is really laggy and freezes a lot of the time. Also, I don't know if there is a backlit keyboard because all the videos showing how to do it never work. :(","Bought for daughters school online learning. Nice size and like the mouse pad that converts into a calculator, great for maths lessons. The only downside is volume isnt as powerful as previous laptop  but great for the price.","I was looking for a new Laptop and I found what I wanted in the Asus I purchased.","Laptop is great.\nOnly issue was that the receipt I was given didn't break down vat to cost. It's just handy when your running a small business.","My laptop looks fab. Runs smooth and feels nice!","This laptop is ready to go out of the box. I use Microsoft 365, so little memory taken up with the programme. I use a memory stick for mass storage. Fires up within seconds, display is crisp, no keypad to the right of the keyboard, however, the touchpad can switch to numerical keypad or calculator. Sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in use all day, but I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t managed to flatten the battery yet. The power saver will go to standby but maintain your working pages when restarted.  Excellent value for money (VFM).","Bought this for my Year 6 daughter for homeschooling. \nReally happy we went for the 14inch as it is a perfect size! The smaller one would have been a bit small. Great to have Microsoft 360 included for a year! Such a lovely looking little laptop and at a great price! Was very quick and easy to set up. \nVery happy with this purchase.

With the hdmi port I can connect to a TV and do my artwork, just great.","The laptop looks ultra cool like that from a sci fi yet loses none of the speed or functionality of other laptops. It has plenty of memory to store all my photos and documents on.","Good service and fast ready for collecting","Works well does everything that I require","It does everything a basic laptop should do with above average graphics.

I wish Apple had kept the standard USB slots or provided an adapter with the computer, instead of making you buy an adapter on top of the computer just so you can use your old external hard drive or charge your phone.","Bought as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.","very good goods, I am satisfied","This Apple Mac book is perfect.

Our second one from Apple. We needed another for student kids working from home. There is absolutely nothing to dislike about it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all great! Super easy to set up and link to other devices. Fast and efficient. Highly recommended!!!! Great for all the family!","Its apple..its reliable and works just as you want it too!","Excellent delivery service, and on time. No problems with laptop.","A bit pricey but worth it","Amazing machine. Amazing service at the pick up. It was great to see that the company is applying to the COVID-19 rules and keeps the stuff and customer's safety and well being in mind. \nKeep up the good work guys.","Amazing service, easy to do and so quick","Absolutely fabulously light and portable and very easy to use if used apple products before.","Superb purchase ! Everything I hoped for and more! Delighted customer :0)","Very easy to use, the sound of the videos is amazing, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very happy with my purchase","I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO BUY THIS PRODUCT AND I FINALLY GOT IT \nTHANK YOU","Lovely, light and THIN, are three good words to describe my MacBook Air. I use an iPad a lot so needed something that was as close to being portable as a laptop can get. The screen is bright and clear, it does smudge but this kind of display always will. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than quick enough for my needs so far. The most surprising thing was the onboard sound. The speakers on both sides combine to make great sound which appears to be coming from behind you.","I've only just started using my MacBook Air laptop and up to now I've found it pretty easy to navigate apart from struggling to load files from an external drive. Sussed it out in the end. Easy when you know how.","Very good but not brilliant, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thin & light & well designed, very nice to use, gets a bit clunky with heavy duty stuff inc some busy websites, battery life could be better as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much better than my Macbook pro which leaves it standing from a performance perspective, overall very pleased but you pay for that apple logo! If you want thin & light with ok performance this is fine if you want performance & don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a bit thicker & a bit heavier pay the extra \u00c2\u00a3200ish & get the pro.","Well, for many years I had windows PC, but this time I decided to change as I love my Apple phone, so I knew I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go wrong with my decision, and I was right, fast, intuitive, easy to use, battery lasts long, amazing sound and video quality, portable, light... etc! Got really surprised and I am very happy with my MacBook.","Not much to say other than, brilliant."]},"review_title":{"0":[""],"1":["Love my new HP laptop","Easy to use","Great laptop","Awesome Laptop","Great laptop","Laptop is very sleek looking and efficient","My laptop was good service.","Very good laptop","Great laptop great spec and price","Fantastic have.","Innovative product","great laptop","Quick collection.
