            "I love this phone the camera is perfect I haven't even used all the different options  yet but the quality of the pictures are excellent.  I love the fact you can move most of the aps to the sd card.  I have so much space I am not worried about fill this phone up.  The size is perfect as it has a lovely large screen that makes playing games and looking at Facebook easy.  It's really easy to use.",

            "V easy to use, fast too. Don't do games or films on the phone so won't be able to comment on those. I paid Vodafone (staff very helpful) to transfer stuff from the old phone to this one, but there is a free app online that you can DIY. As it is not the top range phone, v difficult to get accessories. It is 5G, let's hope the phone will last.",

Great camera and only need to charge the battery every couple of days. Set up was quick and easy and being able to automatically transfer all contacts and Apps was a bonus. Great amount of memory also.",

It is a little bit bigger than my last Samsung but I have not found that a problem fits easily in my hand and face recognition works every time.",
            "After replacing my s10 with a A42 5g I was expecting a down grade on features, not so.\nScreen resolution, sound and cameras on this phone are just as good, battery lasts a good two days for me, a high user.\nOnly let down is the lack of wireless charge ability. We'll worth the money.",

            "Love this phone. Lots of room for apps and storage. Only issue is the shutter speed on the camera is slow which causes you to miss the moment. Especially with children and pets that move a lot. The phone is over all good value.",

Very fast operating system, loads of memory, very easy to use,which is a massive positive for me. another brilliant phone by samsung.",

            "Great device. Efficient, easy to use and awesome camera !",
            "The phone has a lovely big screen and very large memory for lots of apps. I think the shutter speed on the camera is too slow however. Also the keyboard is slow and frustrating",
            "Bought 4 of them.  In many ways better than my year old S20+.  It has reasonable camera (out of the box, no need for the ongoing camera updates). It has 3.5mm accessory jack, expansion card slot (that S21+ doesn't have) and relatively fast processor.  The low display resolution doesn't mean, that your photos, or video clips have low resolution.  You can always watch them in hi-res on your tablet, or laptop.  The low screen resolution equals to lower power consumption and longer battery time. The A42 5G super amoled screen in general use (games, Youtube), is no different, from hi-res screen in my S20+.  In fact after my purchase of first A42 5G, I have reduced the resolution of my other phones, to reduce the time they spend on high speed chargers.",
            "Very happy with this phone. Good battery life, and much more storage than my old Galaxy, and I was able to quickly, and easily, transfer everything straight over from my old phone.\nTakes good, sharp photos and videos.",
