            "What a device. Functions superbly, however video recording at 50x can only be done holding the shutter button in photo mode. Some apps do not keep the colour tone of the light/dark mode, for instance, opening an app with the phone in dark mode, sometimes parts of it will revert to light mode. A simple toggle of the dark mode selection fixes this. Sometimes, apps fail to open up to the while screen and again, you have to toggle full screen app mode, even if the app isn't selected for full screen operation. The performance of the device though is phenomenal, however the s pen isn't great for left handed people, who tend to rest a part of the writing hand on the screen. These are only minor concerns, which are forgotten about with the fantastic performance of the device.",

Screen is gorgeous, processor really fast, camera makes a photographer out of everyone, S pen works like a charm. Unlike two of my iPhones, this phone has NOT frozen single once since I got it (September 2020). One thing I would not miss though is the curved screen.",

I chose the note because of stylus, it's got great uses, I especially like if you need to jot down a quick note, you literally take phone from pocket, pull stylus out and write on screen, it saves as a note instantly. There's so many useful features with Samsung like it comes with Microsoft office, how you can personalize your phone is fabulous. I love how the screen curves. It's nice and big, which is great. The camera is just amazing. I even love the sound effects and ringtone choices. I've had it over a month and it hasn't glitched yet. I'm very very impressed especially compared to my previous iPhone 11.",
            "I love the phone but why does it cost so much? Why make cheaper stripped down versions of the same phone which take up more resources and money to design? I've always had a note but my next phone will probably not be a note and may not be a Samsung.",
            "The device in itself is excellent, very user friendly for such a powerful device however the battery life could be a little better. One disappointment is after receiving the one ui 3.0 update google discover is still missing and Samsung said they have no immediate plans to introduce this to the UK market.",
            "Overall this phone is by far the most tremendous bit of kit I have had in years!\n\nI have only had one slight issue, and that is regarding the notification panel. Sometimes the notifications are obscured due to the pane not scrolling correctly.\nThis causes me to be unable to read the whole message when pertaining to communication applications. It also makes it difficult to reply as I cannot always see what I am typing.\nI have searched through all available settings and cannot find a solution as of yet.\n\nBesides this one very minor inconvenience, the phone is extremely impressive and I can only look towards the future of Samsung with excitement.",

            "I was torn between the white and the black colour varients. Normally I would go for the black because I like the stealth look. But having a silver camera module, it just made the white colour stand out. Therefore I went with the white in the end and I am constantly taking the case off the phone just to look at the stunning craftsmanship. It is truly and underrated colour, and deserves a lot more credibility. \n\nThe phone itself is a marvel, trading in my s20+ I honestly have no regrets. My one slight issue is that I keep experiencing a vibration/ rattling sound near the top half of the phone. Probably from the camera module. Im not sure if this is normal.",
            "Love the capability, the capacity, the screen size, the RAM, the memory, the S-Pen, the super fast charginmg the myriad features that after 2 months I'm still learning about. Would be nice if it lasted all day ! It always lasts through work day until I get home,but never lasts until bedtime. It seems that 120hz screen can't be enjoyed without worrying about incessant battery drain.",

            "The camera's are actually quite bad quality, even in bright conditions the pictures are blurry and out of focus, apart from very centre.\nGeneral performance; some apps take a age to open, discord takes approx 5 seconds, chrome keeps crashing, the samsung browser is far worse.\nThe only good bit is the 120hz screen, other then that it's just bad.\n\nDefinitely going back to the iPhone's. Last android I ever buy!",
            "I have just upgraded from an S10. For some reason someone decided it was a good idea to change the power/restart button from a single button to a 2 button combination. This is is ludicrous. It makes it almost impossible to easily restart the s20, especially if you have a case fitted. A classic case of \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\". Also the network stability is awful when roaming between mobile network cells - hence needing to restart. If you want a decent solid phone stick to the s10",
            "I love the Samsung Galaxy Note  20Ultra 5G and something i don't like is the book s\nbut have gone back to my old book flex 13.3 inch that is the best galaxy book I ever have and i like the new Microsoft Link to windows features in galaxy note 10 and 20 series and it is real No one does 5G than Samsung even when i see my sisters new iphone 12Pro that was not interesting in the iphone no improvement of battery life camera even shame to compare with samsung . I have Samsung note 3,5,8,9,10+ 5g and 20ultra 5g .and the samsung galaxy buds live,watch 3,tab s7+ was great but not the book s",
            "best things are the battery life and charging times.  Much improved compared with the Galazy S8 that it replaced",
            "Having been a huge note series fan since the Note 4, I have had every update since. I have always been impressed with the new features introduced in each new series and much is the same with this compared to the Note 10 plus.\n\nThe camera is a huge stand out compared to the note 10 plus. I found myself reaching for my DSLR instead of using the camera on most occasions, but since getting the note 20 ultra...I've hardly picked up my DSLR! \n\nThe only real draw back for me is that despite the better battery on paper, I find myself running out much quicker than I ever did on the note 10 plus. Plus I have had the odd glitch here and there which stopped me being able to use the screen altogether without restarting the phone. Not to mention the immense frustration of listening to music on the new buds live, but getting interrupted by a call and on returning to listening to music...I find it is playing through the earpiece on my phone - have to restart the phone to get the buds to connect properly again! I didn't experience any of that even once on the old note 10.\n\nOne feature I will forever miss, which was introduced from the note 10 onwards, is the iris scanner. I loved that on the note 9 and I just don't trust the face scanner after testing it with a picture of myself and being able to unlock the phone. Such a shame we lose this due to maximising screen size.\n\nAll-in-all though...I love my note 20 ultra! In spite of the missing bits mentioned above and that's because of the great things it brings with it.",

It is taking some time to get used to the size of the keyboard and I keep hitting the n instead of the space bar which is irritating, though the autocorrect helps somewhat.  I'm 59 years old and probably use only a small fraction of the phone's features but I'm pleased with it so far.  The fingerprint scanner seems to work most times contrary to some reviews I've read.  I love the stilo and taking selfies with it is much easier.  I find that I am learning new things every day and am enjoying my new phone and it's amazing camera.",
            "What a lovely screen this phone has! I absolutely love watching movies and HQ YouTube videos on this device. The device itself is quite snappy but would have been better with the Snapdragon variant.\n\nThe pen is lovely to use and makes notetaking a breeze. The super-fast charging is amazing but I am aware that this will reduce battery life in the long-term.",
            "Good but a bit gutting I didn't have any ear buds or ear phones",

            "I had the Note 9, bypassed the 10 and went for the Note 20 Ultra.  Why wouldn't I?  All reviews said the phone is a monster and they were right.  \n\nSo the S20 Ultra camera blows the Note 20's out of the water but for this powerhouse, it makes little difference.  The quality I see is not that much different to the S20's camera and in honesty, even the 50x zoom is so sensitive it needs a solid base to work from if you're using it.\n\nScreen quality is exceptional - it's the bit I look at for games and for work so it's the most important bit.  Sitting at 50% brightness keeps battery life and still provides enough for a perfect image indoors.  \n\nSound quality is as good as it gets for tiny little speakers hidden in a phone, stereo is surprisingly good and once hooked up to Bluetooth speakers or headphones, up goes the volume accordingly.\n\nConnection to WiFi, Bluetooth devices and the Galaxy Watch 3 is a matter of seconds, stable connection - so far never lost a connection.  Links to my car within moments of getting in and with the Google Auto App, sat nav is photo image instant update accurate. \n\nAny issues?  Google Auto does not disconnect fully causing Spotify to fire up seemingly at random after getting out from the car.  Not sure if this Spotify, Google Auto or the phone but it only ever happened with the Note 20 Ultra.  That's all.  The rest is a big thumbs up from me!  he phone is awesome and with a Galaxy Watch, it just gets better.",
            "The phone has some amazing features and runs really fast and smoothly. Although, one BIG drawback is the battery- the battery drains faster than a bucket with a hole in it. I've changed my battery settings, to save battery life, but limits the CPU speed and other features. And even on power mode I'm still losing 8% in 15 minutes. A new phone should not drain this quickly, and it's really limiting the functionality of the phone. Would not recommend.",

You name it, its got it. \n\nThe only, only, and I mean only thing I would change, is the finger print scanner. The underscreen scanner is cool, but it does lack speed compared to the note 9's fingerprint sensor placed on the back of the phone. That was super \nQuick.",

            "Having had a note 9 previously I had an idea of what to expect. There are so many improvements with this one though I dont know if ill ever find them all. Very easy to use, brilliant screen and the camera is awesome. Size wise it is a big phone but thats fine with me and I prefer that. The battery lasts all day and I use it quite a bit for calls, WhatsApp and gaming. Transferring my info and account was seamless and done in the store.\nOverall easy to use, android gives you so much more usability than ios and I'm very happy. Fast processor and operating system means I have used this for most things rather than my pc or tablet. Looks good too. Only gripe I could have is the connection to the Bluetooth buds, after a day or so it seems to start breaking up. I've tried all the solutions I've found on the Web and help pages but not fixed. Plug in earphones are fine so I'm thinking it must be the Bluetooth connection. My note 9 was the same and its no different with either buds plus or the new live ones. Hopefully there will be a fix for it sooner rather than later. That apart pretty much perfect.",
            "Brilliant handset great features super quick Samsung does it again",
            "120hz makes 60 hz displays feel choppy now. The low latency of the pens is excellent and feels great. The removal of the Bixby button while a shame to lose a custom button was a good move while the rest of the buttons are better placed. Now a few down sides. \nIt's amazing how a phone with such a big battery can have such poor battery idle battery life. The screen on battery isn't great but would be liveable with if the idle battery wasn't worse than my 2 year old Note 9 with a well worn and damaged by over heating battery (admittedly my fault but does make my point stronger). The phone spends a lot of time warm even when not in use while the battery usage gives no indication anything is using the battery. My Note 9 would finish a day on 60 to 40% this needs is 15 to 0%. The glass front and back panels make it feel like your holding a bar of soap, a skin or case is a must and thats before you get to the massive camera bump that makes the phone almost unusable on a flat surface it should have been in the centre. The screen is great its just a shame the edge give you phantom taps all the time and when unlocking will give you the something is covering the screen error all the time when nothing is touching it. Samsungs cameras are clearly good and getting better, the phone seems to actually use the different lens this time while my Note 9 often said it was while just digitally zooming in but the software still doesn't handle noise reduction and sharpening very well. Also the Note 20 Ultra likes to over expose shots and priorities too slower shutter blurring images to keep the ISO low. Which I can only assume is because the noise reduction still isn't up to scratch. The 50x digital zoom should have never been added however it is so poor quality it can only be used for marketing and nothing else. There are still many unnecessary animations like the one that takes 7 seconds to put the phone battery saving mode while on pretty much any other phone is instant, I wouldn't mind if trying to skip it didn't cancel turning it on. I also don't need to know the setting power saving is going to use when going into it, that's what the settings menu is for. Multi window and floating windows used to be very very good on the Note series but now takes too many extra taps and isn't nearly as accessible with Samsungs current UI. The price this year is also well off the Note 20 is the price Ultra should be while the normally Note 20 has been ham stringed unnecessarily and priced like a fruit based device. With the price as it is and the lack of headphone jack on a flag ship phone which is meant to be the Ultra can do everything phone makes me wonder why I stayed with Samsung. The pen as great as it is isn't enough anymore. Final side note I've lost over 9% of battery just writing this review the phone isn't doing anything else.",

I've had to buy a high drain wattage powerbank so I can charge it on the go. £50 more expense.  A higher MAh should of been used.\nBeautiful phone but the camera bump is to big. But then again its always in its case so its hidden. \nMy only gripe is the camera focus. It is terrible. It makes reading QR codes frustrating as hell as well as for focusing on specific areas of a shot. \n\nAlso the sim card slot only has room for either 2 nano sims or one and a memory card. Where as the A21 ( my cheap work given phone ) has space for 2 nano sims and a memory card. I suppose you could get around this buy making one an e sim but its added hassle.",

The claims of excellent battery life is one of the reasons that swayed me away from another iPhone this time.

            "I have to admit, I was rather underwhelmed with the Note20 Ultra. This is the first Note I've ever owned and I upgraded from an S9+. And other than the stylus and the screen size, there really wasn't that much difference between the two in terms of innovation or speed.\n\nI expected tons of new & exclusive features in settings but there was hardly any. The only 'unique' features off the top of my head come in the form of settings and apps that make use of the stylus. Everything else was in the settings of my S9+.\n\nAnother problem I've noticed is that the screen can randomly freeze whilst typing, using Chrome or the in-built browser. You have to minimise the screen then maximise it again for the screen/webpage to unfreeze. I have no idea what causes this and other people have experienced this issue too.\n\nAll in all, it's a really nice phone with a nice screen size etc although I'm not a big fan of the camera protruding from the back. I'm always anxious that I'll damage or scratch it when I put the phone down on a hard surface. I guess I just expected a little more WOW for the price having upgraded from the S9+ that's all.",

I play a lot of games on it and its got by far the best battery life of any of the Samsung phones I have previously owned or tried. \n\nThe mystic bronze colour is fab , I just wish the matching phone cover was the exact same colour but never mind.\n\nI brought the phone for its battery life and camera. The camera is great and I think I can finally ditch my separate camera on holidays now as the night mode is finallu better than my actual separate camera.\n\nAs to the pen, I haven't really used it after the initial novelty of having one. I find it easier to use the keyboard but that's probably just what I am used to.\n\nPhone is definitely on upgrade from the s9plus. Its more responsive . Definitely worth upgrading to.",

            "The features and camera are very good but battery is very very bad so i need to charge my phone minimum 2 times in a day .Also the performance is not great because its getting hot",
            "It is by the best Samsung phone ever, its display is crystal clear, and the battery life is impressive. Not really used the s pen much but when I have used it, it was impressive and smooth.\nNot tried gaming as I play games from the playstore but these are a markedly better experience than my old s9 plus.\nOverall I would definitely recommend this phone for whatever you do in life because it caters for everyone.",
            "This phone is a great demonstration of style, performance and reliability. It has become the main feature in my day ro day life. The camera is great. Can't say enough of the S pen and its functionality. Having owned previous versions of note line, this is truly another great phone from Samsung.",
            "I absolutely love the note series and the note 20 ultra has absolutely blown me away! That being said there is a couple of things that need to be fixed. The phone overheats when I charge and watch videos on my phone. The battery drains just as much as my note 10 plus did after 2 years of use.",
            "Samsung you have done it again GRADE A FEEL GRADE A PROFOMANCE!",
            "Great phone, wouldn't do without it, keep making great phones",
            "Ive had Samsung phones for around ten years now \nThe reason i stay with them is build quality and reliability i also like the layout of the phone and the\n large screen size and the bigger storage capacity \nplus the reliability I've always had with Samsung phones",
            "I chose the note 20 ultra for business use, as it appeared to have several features which I though would be useful. I like the overall experience and the screen is great, however the battery does discharge quite quickly while using it. My biggest issue is the fact that Samsung see the need to limit group texts to 20? As a business user I am used to communicating with my customers by text and this sometimes includes groups of 100+ . My network supplier provides unlimited texts so why does Samsung put in this needless limitation. As these handsets get more expensive I can see nothing that justified the huge price tag. There are cheaper phones on the market that are more functional in practice terms.",
            "Perfect - does what it says on the box and more! An ideal companion.",
            "The note series just gets better and better I've always had a note since they first came out and the note 20 5g is the best yet",
            "Camera is great and the features, especially the S-Pen are excellent, but the build quality is very poor. My screen cracked whilst in my pocket on a walk. An issue I have never had with competitor products.",
            "The screen is fantastic.  Having the extra size after moving up from an S10+ is really good.  I use this device for work as well as personal usage and to have the extra screen size to read documents and mark them up with the stylus is awesome.  The phone stops me reaching for my laptop constantly.",
            "Mostly, the phone is great and it performs well. I think the rose- gold/ bronze colour is very stylish, but the back camera protrudes in a slightly unsightly way.  I like the bigger size, the keyboard and s pen are both very responsive, although, the on screen keyboard occasionally freezes or pops up randomly on other apps.",
            "Has an amazing camera to take shots that are stunning. Fast scrolling speeds & taking notes with the note pen is just like writing on real paper!",
            "I am disappointed about battery life. I am not happy regarding procesor should to have option to choose from exinos and snap dragon. Overall it's a good phone but a little bit expensive.",
            "Not impressed generally,  camera is very good, find it hard to get into phone/turn on. Definitely not worth the money, no better then my Note 8 which it replaced!",
            "Camera is great, but not much is that better than my old note. Waiting to see if the 5g works and time will tell",
            "Amazing phone just wish it was not Europe spec as us has better processor",
            "This phone is in a different league .\nI can't think any phone can come close to it .",
            "Great design & features with the 120hz refresh rate.",
            "I had a note 10+ in my opinion the note 20 is not an improvement, worse battery and performance, less memory along with freezing screen issues, poor trade in value against the note 20 ultra. This is the first galaxy note that I've been disappointed with",
            "Great Phone Can't Say A Bad Word About It ........",
            "The phone itself is probably the best phone i've ever had!\nDespite the fact that i dropped it and scuffed the edges and it doesn't look to great, the camera protruding the out the rear means i am super paranoid that i might scuff of scratch it. All in all a great phone superb camera and a stunning look (outside of the scuffs )",
            "Sold on this phone when it first lauched to the point I traded in my S10+ a year earlier and I am not disappointed in the slightest. Pricey yes! But an amazing piece of kit.",
            "I really love this  Samsung Galaxy Note 20 5G is all about his multi-tasking features especially using the pen and also the quality of video resolution.",
            "This is a really good phone. It runs what I need it to and then some. Pairs great with other Samsung products like Smart TV and Galaxy Buds. Amazing display and haptic feedback. I just hate how useless Bixby is in comparison to Google Assistant. The battery life on this phone, which I've been using daily since August 21 is utterly abysmal. Otherwise, its a pretty amazing phone. Camera, screen, speakers; its all great.",
            "Large screen, frustrating as it has a mind of its own sometimes so does random stuff ringing, playing videos I think its over sensitive.  Love the split screen when texting for ease of typing with both hands.",
            "The last Samsung smartphone I had was the tab 7 back in the days. I also was in love with the Monte! I went after that to other smartphone makers which I loved a lot of them and I consider myself a loyal fan of one of them.\nHowever with the Galaxy Note20 Ultra, I can't say nothing except it's literally the best flagship in the current market.\nFantastic design, superb display and colours, excellent camera and audio, reliable battery and size, really unique features that transforms this phone to a complete PC and you can even use it on a big screen with an easy wireless connection through the brilliant Dex, and also Note20 Ultra has been awarded the best gaming phone which is well deserved considering its abilities in terms of speed, graphics, fps, power, cooling, sound... etc!\nI don't use the stylus a lot but it's truly inspiring, I begin with taking a small note, then I find myself going through artistic creations!\nThe combination of the wireless charger and the Note20 Ultra made me forgot the battery and the normal charger, it also helped a lot on connecting with the wireless gaming controller which made a console experience on the phone..!\nIt's a mobile full of pros with barely present cons or no cons at all. It would be honestly difficult to change to another one even when this one ages...\nRecommended with no competitors..!",
            "I have been using the Note series for a good few years and in each phone the technology gets better and more innovative. I'm going to keep getting the series until Samsung streamlines a change in this phone series, Camera is excellent and this phone is faster than other series.",
            "Easy to use. Beast of a performance.ealegent design!",
            "Great phone  but I dislike the camera bump\nThe battery should have been 5000 mha",
            "Upgraded from the note 10 plus and was quite disappointed with the upgrade. The battery life seemed to be a downgrade when using 120hz screen display which is why I upgraded in the first place. Would have liked to be able to run at 120hz without needing to charge the phone up during the day. I use the phone religiously in work which is a dusty and warm environment and havent had an issue with the phones performance other than the battery life. Camera is the best upgrade from the older model with very good features.",
            "Love everything about this phone. The massive screen is brilliant.",
            "It's big, when I want to read it's ace. I am the envy of everyone in the pub!",
            "If I have of known that the z fold was going to be released, I would never have bought it.  It is nothing special and quite frankly, not worth the money.  The case I bought with it, has already started to lose its colour in patches.  After the money I spent, I expected better.  Now I am stuck with a phone that I am not happy with.",
            "I love this phone. Great size and some nifty pen features.",
            "Love how sharp the colour is and how fast the phone is",
            "The camera is a real positive.\nBattery life is disappointing. I don't understand why European versions don't have the snapdragon chips",
            "Being an older type, the slightly bigger keys, screen and the pen make life a lot easier. It's started surprising me with a new Bixby routine every day, which is novel. But mainly It's about much more flexibility in every area so you can work the way you want to, nit the way the phone's functionality let's you.",
            "I feel it is following the iPhone in many ways of getting rid of features and charging more for that. In comparison to previous generations the Note family offer is not living up to expectations, the \"cheaper\" Note is not worthy of the name as it's a terrible deal, and the Ultra note just doesn't deliver in most areas unfortunately.\n\nThe Exynos version has battery life that is on par with my 2 year old well used Note 9...it just doesn't last as long as it seems like it should. \nThe super 120hz display is good but it doesn't offer the full resolution, and again hits the battery life. Compromise is not why I buy a Note. \nThe fingerprint sensor is ok but I found it frustrating as I couldn't just take phone out of the pocket and unlock without thinking, it took more effort to use than other phones. Also I missed the old gesture that could be used with the rear one.\nThe screen is lovely but just a bit too big, the 6.5 of old was big enough and 6.9 just felt too big. I'd like a smaller screen but still flagship features. Also the hole for the camera isn't great but is the smallest they've done so far. \nThe S pen was still a delight to use but the older ones were still great anyway, the design of the new one felt easier to hold though. Moving where it was stored was a slight frustration much like moving the volume buttons. \nThe 5x zoom is good when you actually need to zoom to that level but I was hoping that the zoom would be used from 2x-5x but it is blurry at 4.9x for instance then you can clearly see it switch to 5x and becomes clearer. For the massive bulge that makes the phone heavier this is a shame. \n\nI ended up sending mine back before the 28 days were up as I had to go back to my Note 9. I couldn't justify the new price a month for what I found to be a mostly inferior phone. Specifically I miss the LED notification light, headphone jack, and the heart rate sensor.",
            "Brilliant phone but very very expensive. Wouldn't go back to apple or google",
            "Note Ultra is amazing just need more software upgrade need withing 15-20 days time",
            "Does everything and does everything extremely well. Pre this phone i had nothing but apple products yet on getting this phone I was blown away by the clarity, speed and battery life.\nThats before I even get to the camera, literally cannot praise it enough.\nNot sure about the pen though in all honesty used it once for novelty and don't think it will come out again lol",
            "Camera and sound quality.\n\nStylus on LHS\n\nNot able to select own photo for screensaver.",
            "Game changing Performance, screen refreshing rate are amazing",
            "Sadly I upgraded from a note 10 plus 5g and so far this phone feels inferior. The fingerprint scanner is far slower the the note 10 and the battery is far worse.",
            "I have never enjoyed owning a phone as much as the Samsung Note20 Ultra. The cameras are extraordinarily good. The make taking photos a breeze.",
            "Love the size of the phone. Love most things about it. Game wise im struggling to find something to play to be fair. The only thing I don't like is the battery life. I work in a place I cant use my phone that much and when I do the battery is shocking. Buts me off the phone that I'm spending a lot of money on. Maybe its a faulty battery I don't know but its bad. So not too happy about that",
            "This phone is the best on the market! The features are awesome, and the cameras are extremely excellent. I was a iphone man but then this phone come along, and now I am a Samsung man for life!",
            "The design love the boxy design, I am always  a note user the screen is amazing . I would rather have a thicker phone with a bigger battery  .but great battery life",
            "The camera , the size, the screen, and all the features. Love it ❤️",
            "The Samsung Galaxy note 20 ultra is the best Samsung I've ever seen and owned.",
            "No headphone socket, poor battery life.\nBack to the drawing board Samsung...",
            "An awesome phone.  Screen (best feature), camera and video are slick and a joy to use.\nThe pen?  Wow!  Writing is silky with no latency.  \nOnly down side is the battery:  lasts a day no bother but seems to drain alittle more than usual throughout the day (when not being used so much).  It's a minor issue as I can't put the phone down.  Watching Netflix (with Dolby atmos on) on the 120Hz screen is fabulous.\nI love the notes and this one is best yet.",
            "Love the screen, love the styling, love the cameras. In fact I love the phone all apart from the slightly rubbish battery life. I an assuming it is because of the exynos soc which slightly spoils an amazing phone.",
            "At first I wasn't sure to give my note10 plus up in order to get this phone. Only because most reviews were going on about the European Exynos \nversion wasn't going to be as good  as the US version. Well day by day this phone is becoming more and more of a beast. Fast clear and clean. Samsung has produced a sensational looking phone and it's processing and updates are current and great. Camera is brilliant and the pen just perfect. I love it and I've got 2 iPhone users convert to this phone. Fantastic guys. Really happy.",
            "Overall the phone is attractive except the HUGE bump for the camera. Power is lacking, features are basic. Battery is awful and doesn't get much better. Camera is basic, can't take detailed pictures, everything pixelates when you zoom in. My favourite feature that differs from other phones is the S pen which was great until I realised I'd have to buy replacement nibs. Overall waste of money. I upgraded from a OnePlus, which worked smoother an the batter life was much longer!",
            "One of the best feature laden phones I have ever owned. Silky-smooth and responsive. The camera makes my photos come to life. I find myself using the S pen more and more. Being someone that likes gaming this phone handles games with ease.",
            "What a device this is, Stylish, unbelievable features, fantastic battery life, simply brilliant",
            "Great phone overall,  but the aux though the usb is not supported",
            "I got it to experience the Note features, it is a great piece of equipment but It crashed 4 times while browsing. Not worth the price",
            "Let's say I think it is the perfect phone fabelet..in every way..and gaming cod..is a grate experience. But wish it was snapdragon 865+ .why give america a better phone..processor is everything. To a monster ov a phone like this..but exodus dose the job...but it sucks battery .",
            "What can I say, its got everything and more. Camera features are great and I am still  learning what it can do. Its lightning fast. \nOnly negative is that when I am on a phone call using Galaxy Buds Live and an email comes in, I get an alert sound. That will be a feature somewhere that I haven't gotten around to knocking off so its not really a negative. \nIt is a pricey phone, but managed to trade in my old phone and get it on a 0% payment offer. With a SIM only contact it works out cheaper than getting on a contract from a phone vendor. Plus it will be paid in two years where the current contracts are more than two years. \nThe sticky out camera takes some getting used to but a good case to protect it will help (unicorn beetle pro)",
            "Brilliant phone does everything I need and more.\nAlways had note phones love the pen.",
            "Having owned the Note 9 and used it for both work and pleasure I was pleased to find the Note 20 was a significant upgrade but kept all the features I used. Great phone and an easy to use operating system",
            "Love the note series, just wondered why we didn’t get the 865 snapdragon in the uk",
            "I find my new phone very useful in my work life, being able to edit and sign PDFs directly in Notes is fantastic.  Screen Quality is excellent and Keyboard functionality is very useful.\nBattery life is very good.",
            "Great phone works well in all that I have put it through best Note on the market by far",
            "The slim beautiful Note 20 Ultra 5G is packed with professional power and fun features. It is so good and can do so much, it's kept close at hand from sunrise to lights out. This is not just a phone, personal computer and camera, but a companion that enhances your life.",
            "Still getting to grips with the phone, pre-ordered and been running as a dual sim personal / business device.  In that regard, I doubt there's a better phone.  The large, high resolution screen and adaptive display makes it brilliant at using Microsoft apps, \n\nVideo is great in wqhd and the camera us superb.  10/10 from me.  Don't miss the snapdragon chip.",
            "Not had a new phone since 8 Edge. Nearly got the note ten but as this was coming out and the prices were nearly the same it was a no brainer. I'm not going into depth as we all know how great this phone is.i still have loads to learn about this phone but thats the fun.if you don't have this phone and are looking to upgrade do it .you will love this phone",
            "good phone but feel short changed by samsung's decision not to let uk have the much faster snapdragon version, battery isn't great and the  device does get quite warm when in use",
            "Amazing screen, camera, high-end performance and I really love the s pen. \nSeems to struggle with h+ signal on Vodafone",
            "Awful. Why do we in the UK have the rubbish Exynos prosser, we should all get the same.\n\nThis is the second note 20 ultra I have had now and both phones have become so hot when the camera is in use I cannot hold it. Extremely disappointed with this, I could potentially leave samsung for someone who puts all there customers into the same category",
            "Beautiful phone with a fantastic display\nUnfortunately it has a problem maintaining a stable data connection and when it freezes can only be fixed by toggling airplane mode on and off\nSamsung please fix this issue",
            "I am an avid Samsung user, and this phone has ticked every box and more. I had the S10+ before and this note 20 ultra has blown it out the water. Display is perfect, the s pen I've found myself using way more then I though I would. It's just a great, great phone and even though expensive it's worth it.",
            "Everything about this device i love from the pen to the big screen. However I noticw that the battery runs out a lot quicker to other devices I have used. Not a big issue just have to remember a power bank when I'm out",
            "I like camera Photo and video but the battery life is soo rubbish and I'm still waiting for ear bud live thanks",
            "I am a big Samsung fan. The Note 20 Ultra offers a lot of great features, but to be honest, the upgrade from an S10 5G wasn't worth it. The performance on spreadsheets is hardly noticeable, the sound quality not much better, the battery life is worse. Frankly, the camera on most phones is good enough for me.\n\nThe most disappointing thing is the form...the camera sticks out  far too much,  and throws the weight all into \nthat area, making it feel uncomfortable in the hand. \n\nHonestly, if you have an S10 5G , you've probably got all your need. The upgrade to have a pen device ... not worth it.",
            "Love:\n•Screen\n•Cameras\n•S-pen\n•Expandable memory\n•Water and dust resistance\n•Build Quality\n•Speakers\n•Multi-tasking\n•Customisability\n\nDissapointing:\n•Battery life ( Make phone thicker for bettery and bigger battery)\n•Performance ( ensure same SOC is used for all models is all markets.

            "Battery keeps dying great phone stupid battery hate it",

            "outstanding camera, design and build.  screen is best in class.",
            "Stunning to look at, premium build and impressive specifications make this an easy contender for the best smartphone of 2020. I love the quality and size of the 120Hz Amoled screen, the high end cameras (especially the 5x telephoto), the ever useful S-Pen and impressive overall performance.",
            "I am going to start with,  how I have been an apple fan since day one. \nOver the years I have grown more and more fed up with the lack of change just the same old phone zzzzzzzzz \n\nI saw the Galaxy S20 note ultra and fell head over heels with it. \n\nI am now loving my new phone and not being a apple sheep.",
            "Love the size of it and the pen is great. Very good screen qualityand the camera is amazing.",
            "Great screen, super cameras, responsive, capable and beautifully constructed! Find a way to avoid paying the official price however...that's the scary part.",
            "The games run excellently it's perfect for absolutely everything superb performance all around and xbox x cloud is absolutely fantastic would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone keep up the amazing work",
            "Coming from a Galaxy note 9 I was already into the Samsung/s-pen centric ecosystem and was already comfortable and proficient with the extra hardware. I bought the note 9 for the large display and speaker set up for content consumption and am happy with the larger display and louder speakers on the note 20 ultra.\n\nThe 120hz display and massive camera on the rear of the handset are both welcome upgrades also, having the ultrawide capabilities that were sorely missed on the note 9 is a game changer for the overall experience of the phone and the final piece of the puzzle in my mind.\n\nAll in, I'm happy with what I've got for my upgrade, it hasn't felt generational and feels like a meaningful upgrade of handset, especially coming from my note 9.",
            "Fast, never slows down, but had a few issues but that's just android",
            "Love everything about the phone  with the exception of the camera,  means the phone does not lie flat",
            "Best phone so far in my day to day use! Probably will need a bit of improvement on the software bit to make it a bit faster, but overall great phone. Thank you for the opportunity to express my thoughts.",
            "Excellent phone. But the price is to dam high.\nLove the S-Pen. Don't use it much only to draw picture when I'm bored.",
            "I do like this phone but the very big down side is battery and its so annoying as I'm allways watching it when I'm out ... cuz even when you're not using,  still it drains the battery for some reason, even on 60 htz rate .. note 10 was taking more than 20 and iPhone alot more...I'm just rethinking again as I don't want headeach .",
            "It's a really good phone, good camera and over all a good phone.",
            "It’s features, apps and easy to use. I just love the device also it does what it says on the box",
            "Should of stuck with my note 9\nNot much of a upgrade\nApps don't fit the screen properly \nJuddering screen when browsing a lot \nNow the portrait mode stopped working\nCan't tell any difference with the pen\nWish I'd saved my money",
            "Works well, Connects with all smart devices. A pleasure to use.",
            "Love it so much, suspect I may never need another phone....",
            "Was expecting so much more from this device after the Note10+ camera is great but the battery is such a big big let down! Really disappointed and I actually wish I had stuck with the Note10+ silver surfer. Was so much better than the note20 ultra 5G. My advice would be stick with the Note10+ deff not worth the hefty price tag.",
            "It is indeed a superb phone, really great for doing a lot of things, including amazing photography, video capturing, productivity, consuming media and this list will go on. Aesthetically it looks very pleasing too, the best looking mobile phone so far no wonder. However, I would like to see better battery life and the phone does not necessarily has to be so thin. A would rather appreciate a bit thicker phone with tad more battery capacity. Also it would be nice to be able to turn on 120Hz refresh rate at maximum resolution, since I need to charge this phone more often than my previous Note10 plus anyway. So, why not having 120Hz at maximum resolution?",
            "Amazing device.. poor battery performance ... you should do something about this....",
            "Fantastic all round phone does every thing I need and more and does it very well",

            "A great phone, really quick, brilliant camera and huge screen!!",
            "This phone has a lot of stand out features but the display and the fact you can now have 120hmz screen resolve makes gaming so much smoother and nice as to help get the edge on opponents and also help see things faster like other phones don't allow",
            "Great phone, lovely screen, l like having the pen for inputting. BUT! Expensive",
            "This has it all. Samsung have been waiting for the day when they can offer its customers a device that just does everything and does it very well.  That day is here. Cost a small fortune but the best doesn't come cheap.",
            "The actual phone and it's features are great. Apps respond quickly when should.\nOnly a few things I find disappointing is after a couple of days without restarting the phone. The internet connection slows down and some apps don't even respond and a message pops up no internet connection. The phone reception freezes during an app like YouTube, example, if I start watching a video, phone signal is on 3G 4 bars. During that length of the video, it doesn't change. Once the video finished, you leave the app, it'll change signal strength, sometimes crashing the app. Lastly, the camera, it comes across locked at its low aperture. It has a narrow focus point too. So anything within a meter of the camera like a document. You'll only have a few words, a sentence in focus, the rest is blurry. Apparently this a hardware issue and not software.",
            "I really love this device but we have one big problem! Is a common problem. I spoke with a lot of friends and in same time with other people and all of as we crying becouse battery life is poor. We can't have a full day of using without charging. For this reason I apreciate it with only 4 stars.",
            "I love the real feeling of the pen. I'm a little disappointed with the back plastic I thought the Note s20 ultra has glass.",
            "This phone is excellent, really pleased, previously had note 9 which was a very good phone,glad I made the choice to change very happy.",

            "I love every thing about this phone. what its able to do, its unique pencil feature, & its so light weight.",
            "Love everything bout it cool loads of features fab",
            "The phone mostly lives up to it's price. It's an extremely good phone in every aspect... except battery life. It will last you a day no doubt, but I personally would expect more in that department for that size and price.\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because battery life is just too disappointing.\nNext time maybe make the phone thicker and put at least 5500mAh battery.",
            "This is samsung's best phone yet - amazing camera and features . i love the note series .Just a shame the battery doesn't last more than a few hours and gets very hot . Sort it out samsung. very dissapointing",
            "After some great improvement on the Note 10 I thought the 20 will be even better, but sadly not. You swap most of the best bits about the Not 10  for a new camera, why? What is the point of having a 50 x's zoom on a camera which clearly can't handle it, it struggles at 5 x's zoom. I' a photographer and thought it might be Good to have this in my pocket just incase, I used it a few times then stopped, total rubbish. The phone remains me of the Note 7, it's clear you a bigger things on your mind with the Fold. This device frezzes every day for 30 seconds or so as it can't keep up doing simple tasks, it also over heats all the time. Wait it is the Note 7, I can see these setting on fire. As you probably know I have every note since Note 5 and this is the worst one. Will I be buying the next note? Probably not, I remember getting the first ever galaxy phone and got the new one ever year, swop over to the note at 5. Now I think you've reached your limit, so next September I think I will be leaving Samsung and trying a new device.",
            "Yea its 120Hz yes it has more memory but I don't think its that much more of a difference bet this and the note 9 that I've just upgraded from. I do love it but still as with the note 9 smart lock keeps prompting me to unlock my phone even though I've set my home as a place to keep it unlocked with smart lock.",
            "Performance and battery life is not great may be because of using old choose from s20 ultra with new camera and high refresh screen. Which makes it power hugry I replaced the note 2o ultra twice because of battery draining issue which is not good. Which make me think not to buy next time. I love note series. And most important we in UK charge same money for phone so why we not get snapdragon chip set which perform better and has good battery life. This year I m extremely disappointed.",
            "Having previously had the galaxy note 8+ I was definitely ready for a step up in performance & features etc. Many people told me I was silly getting the Note in the first place, as I had always been an apple user, however the Note changed my mind and I can safely say i do not regret switching. So, With all of the hype surrounding the launch of the Note20 Ultra, I was really excited to get my hands on it. When it arrived it felt familiar, like a pari of trainers you've had for years or your favourie tracksuit bottoms that are just comfy. On one hand, this was great, not having to re-learn how to use everything and being fully up to speed straight of the bat! on the other it was underwhelming, I was expecting to be floored with new features, amazing screen clarity and a camera that made me feel like a pro. Maybe it was me allowing the hype to oversell or maybe it was actually, just being oversold?\n\nThe phone is still great, I am still happy I made the switch to Samsung, i've probably got lots to find out about it and really dig down to get it's full use, but ideally i wouldn't need to, it would just be there and amaze me straight away. I would certainly recommend the phone to everyone, just dont let the hype get you carried away!",
            "Samsung has made the best phone for the current\nmarket",
            ". okay. poor battery. very expensive. no big improvement since previous model",
            "I love the overall feel of this phone, great pictures great camera",
            "Superb phone. However, I'll just point out the flaws.\nThe raised camera apperture on the front of the phone causes the phone to wobble when typing on a flat surface as its off to one side!\nFor some reason the s pen being on the left means I dont reach for as it much as I used to on past phones on the right. Also with a gel case on the phone its fiddly to get out!",
            "Had the note 9 before this. This one is better in that everything is smother to operate. The actual glass screen also feels very shock when you slide your finger on it.\nCamera is good although the motion pictures are a bit gimmicky.\nThe battery though lasts about 8 hours maximum if I play a game a few times a day. If its anything like my last two Samsung phones, the battery life will shorten after about 12 months and I'll need to carry an external battery pack. My Google pixel xl battery was strong for the 2 years I owned it.",
            "Nice phone battery life is rubbish worse than the note 9 can use it all day without having to charge so how you can work on it all day is beyond me",
            "I love the notes, I havent found one I havent loved, just keep getting better, this note 20 ultra does what I need a more, still learning more things it can do",
            "There is nothing  I don't like about the phone amazing",
            "Some people have small hands witch is fine for most phones and some people has big hands witch is perfect for this phone easy to get along with",
            "Great phone , only complaint is battery life , camera excellent",
            "Battery life is really disappointing, much worse than Note 10+ and Note 9. Exynos runs hot.\nI do not like the moving of the S pen to the left side. Much more awkward to reach.\nPhone should support and APT-X HD and does not. Your One UI should be updated to allow a bit perfect output to USB so you can use an external DAC. At least be able to play FLAC music at 24 bit 382khz",
            "Great camera and features. The pen is very exact.\nSome calls freeze when theres a lot going on",
            "Pros\nVery responsive screen, crystal clear vision, Super S Pen, great storage, very good camera quality, super sound, professional looking phone, ample RAM & processor, great to hold, relatively lightweight.\nCons\nBattery life is no better than my previous Galaxy Note 9, expected an improvement, some photos taken are unexpectedly blurred.",
            "I like the array of specs and colours availible for this phone I've had the last 3 notes and upgrade to latest each time well done samsung",
            "This phone is amazing. I love the display. The size. The speakers  everything including the vibration motor js very high quality and has a premium feel. Its a joy to use and wonderful to look at. The novelty of using a premium Samsung doesn't wear off. The main issue is that it is meant to be a powerhouse but is hugely held back by its battery life. The exynos chip performs well but its efficiency means the battery life isn't good. I expected to be happy with battery life coming from a galaxy s9 but I was disappointed. Even at 60hz. It just takes away from the whole flagship powerhouse idea and sometimes i use my phone sparingly incase my battery drops too much, which shouldn't be a fear I should have. Furthermore the exynos chip doesn't allow me to select the maximum graphic and framers options simultaneously? My friends old exynos s10 lets him do thay and my note 20 ULTRA doesn't. Very disappointed to see that.",
            "I love android phones. They beat anything apple do and allow you to do more. The note is a great example of this. Big screen with all the added extras. my main concern is the battery life. The phone was sold to me as a gaming phone as it come with a xbox game pass and controller. This has been great but I'm consistently checking my battery. I've been charging my phone multiple times a day since day 1 of having it. its probably due to the size of the phone and the power in running it. I'm working from home so constant charging isn't an issue. I even got a charging station with the phone which is awesome. Despite this, as soon as the world goes back to normal and I'm back in the work place I'm.100% going to need a charging bank with me to keep my phone alive! I've never needed this and it may potentially put me off in the future getting another large phone. I would have given 5 stars if the battery was as good as it said.",
            "I have had my new note 20 ultra for 2 months now and it is totally fantastic and it's great for photos as well in fact it's fantastic all round and I would totally recommend anyone to get one",

            "The best phone out now with the best specs, updates, features and promos.",
            "Enjoy the power and speed. Love the screen. The speakers could be louder but are good quality. The S Pen is useful and finding my way to use it. Giving added functionality and power is brilliant.",
            "Slick interface, speedy response times, and great battery life, with all the features I've come to expect from Samsung products",
            "I always buy note devices because I think they're the best smartphones available. I'm only just getting used to the thumb scanner being on the screen though.",
            "This phone has so many features and bixby routines is fab for me. The screen is excellent although the fingerprint reader is a bit hit and miss sometimes. I haven't had any accidental touches with the screen being curved. The camera is very good although its taken me a while to get used to, especially close ups. There are 2 big disappointments for me thats the processor and battery which I feel is linked. I have had to tweek the phone alot so its now not the full powerhouse I hoped for . I have had to put medium power saving mode on for example to get as much battery as I can. The phone is a lot of money and want to use it to the max.",
            "Brilliant phone, what a powerhouse of a phone. Loving it. Only drawback is the battery life.",
            "I have upgraded from note9 to note20 ultra and I am very pleased",
            "So far every time the phone rings and I press the green phone to answer it , it cuts me off, messenger, and what’s app are so difficult to access, can’t get into apps I want and it keeps going to gmail when I don’t want to use it I’m with virgin media just hate this phone wish I hadn’t bought it!!!!!!",

            "I loved my previous phone to the point I kept it well after my contract expired. Unfortunately it started to show its age in terms of performance so I had to upgrade and boy I was not disappointed! This phone is so much faster, smoother and although I thought the s pen was a gimmic and I'd never use it, I do actually find myself using it quite a lot of the time with the text conversion was the most impressive feature for me when writing with it. The phone also fits nicely in my hands I can reach all the side buttons with one hand and even swipe from the top of the screen but then again I do have big hands. Overall this phone has impressed me and no doubt I will end up doing the same again as I did with my S8+ and keep it long after my contract runs out.",
            "The design and how easy it is to use and how clear video's are",

            "The battery in my old Note 8 lasts twice as long, I'm luck if it lasts all day and I'm not a heavy user.",
            "I have had the note 4, wanted to upgrade to the note 7 but instead got the s7. Got the note 9 and finally upgraded to the note 20 ultra. It is a huge upgrade in so many ways but my major flaw with the phone is the battery life. I felt my note 9 when it was brand new just wouldn't die after a full days use and over the years it started to last less and less. Going from the note 9 to the note 20 ultra I thought their would be a big jump in battery life expectancy. But instead I'm finding the battery drops rapidly even when its not in use with little changes to my use habit from my note 9.",
            "Average battery life and inferior processor come hand in hand with the UK variant of the Note 20 ultra, this is such a shame as the handset itself is a stunning piece of equipment with an excellent screen, marred by the bitter after taste of the fact that other markets have a better version of the phone you have paid your hard earned money out for.",
            "Great camera added to laptop performance make this a very special phone for business and pleasure.",
            "This phone is absolutely awesome. Literally every single thing about the phone is perfect and amazing, EXCEPT the battery life. I've just come to android after 8 years of being an apple user. Its not a good experience to have the phone changed three times due to the battery being so bad. Please improve the battery and it'll be 5 stars!!! \n\nI would recommend the phone but I'll let everyone know how bad the battery is first.",
            "Beautiful camera with great features and pro option! Video record from hd , 4k and 8K! Brilliant display ranging from hd to uhd and 8k, also features a 120hz refresh.

Dolby Atmos featured all round beastly phone you get what you pay for if you love your technology and quality this is your device! Great camera wide lens and high Res options too! A*",
            "Better 5g connection,good design,not happy with 3d scanner witch not working at all",
            "So this is definitely the best Galaxy Note ever. Everything about it is refined and easy to use. It helps me be productive in huge ways both for my business, my M. A., and my personal life. It so has, with some reservations, a superb camera. My biggest gripe (and I'm in the UK so I have the Exynos version) is the poor battery life. There is no way I can get through a working day without charging it once or twice. So, in this one respect Samsung has given UK users a less powerful device.",
            "The note ultra has all the features I need and as a new adopter of the note from the S series I love the pen, just a shame I lose some battery life, the S20 Ultra I had before could smash a day, now I'm a bit scared about being away from a charger.",
            "The flexibility of the new camera is great can cope with most photographic needs.  The additional features of the S pen make it an indispensable addition.",
            "My S 20 Ultra is my first Note and my 3rd Samsung device.Loving the speed of the processor, and the accuracy of the hand writing. As someone with dyspraxia, dysgraphia and dyslexic, it is a great support for my PhD.",
            "Not much different to my note 10 plus, sorry I upgraded.",
            "Lovely device, great features, great camera.\nThe battery is very poor do not expect a full work day. \nIt drain very fast even while using power savers.",
            "This is my 4th Samsung galaxy note starting with the note4 and its by far the perfect combination of performance, flexibility and usability of and model Samsung has produced ..  love it !!!!",
            "Apart from camera nothing is new. If you have note 10 one can keep hold to",
            "The apparent 'Scratch Proof' Gorilla glass screen covering is not scratch proof!",
            "Its loads better than my note 9 alot more features and the camera is amazong",
            "I've always been a massive fan of Samsung Note series and for me it was always the King year after year because it was the most complete phone in the market hands down. That changed with the Note 10s last year and continues with the Note 20s. I like the phone but I'm NOT over impressed with it to the point that I'm back to use my Note 9 as my main driver again. I'm not planning to return it either though because there are a couple of things I really like.\nThis phone would have the absolute beast and undisputed king with headphone jack,  heart rate monitor and iris scanner and with a at least 5000mah battery size because the battery life is not great.",
            "I think its a good phone as it opens apps quicker than other phone I have had, I am happy with it.",
            "Let me start with the good. Setting up my new Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and transferring all my data was simple. Installing the sim and SD card were as easy as any other phones I've used. Once up and running the phone didn't fail to deliver. The screen is crisp and bright, the buttons, all 3 of them, give a nice positive feel when used, the front facing camera is easily ignored even though it intrudes into the screen space. As a person with hearing difficulties I found the sound settings easy to set up to meet my needs. The main cameras capture clean images, even in poor light. Best of all the battery lasts ages and you're not left scrabbling about for a charger half way through the day. Also there doesn't appear to be any noticeable slow down even with lots of apps r nning. I love the copper colour and the matching ear buds, which I can wear with my hearing aids.\n\nAs for the bad bits.... They moved the stylus holder to the other side of the phone! The only other minor gripes I have are the fingerprint sensor isn't as good as others I've used. Although it's better than the one on the back, that really annoyed me. Other things, they've removed the heart rate sensor, which is a shame. I also don't find the sylus as easy to use and I used to use it a lot, it just feels more quirky and unpredictable. The air actions with the stylus are a total waste of time.\n\nOn the whole I love this phone. Other than a few nit picks above it does everything I want. You can keep your iPhones. I've used them all and this phone blows them away.",
            "The phone is very good, long standing note user, only problem is the battery time seems to be poor",
            "Its everything a Galaxy Note should be.\nBig power, Big screen, Big battery.",
            "This would be a great phone and totoally worth the price if it wasnt for the fact that the UK gets the inferior Exynos version and has to pay the same price as the Snapdragon version. This affects battery life and performance. Its just not the same phone as the Snapdragon version and should not be marketed as so.",
            "Love the device speed quality ect however disappointed the heart rate monitor has been removed. With some one that uses this on a regular basic due to suffering with heart palpitations this was definitely a downside for me as I basically forces me to buy a watch which I don't really need. Overall fantastic camera quality specs love it. The charger was faulty with the device also",
            "If you need a phone to do anything this one will not fail you. Its a mobile office, a mobile games console, and of cause when you need it just a phone. Its only negatives are price and its Exynos chipset. Most users will not find a fault with this phone. Thank you Samsung for listening and setting new standards again",
            "It's a nice phone but there's hardly any difference to last yours model. Yes some people will upgrade after few years and will feel the difference but what about those like me that want to upgrade to the latest and greatest? We want to feel like there is a big enough difference. The software doesn't feel any different. Not any faster, smoother or snappier. The UI doesn't come near the aesthetics of iOS even now. It still misses the refinement and pizzazz unfortunately. The Spen is good but most of the functions are just not reliable. Also 120 hertz refresh rate is not really noticeable. Lastly, the battery drains too quick and that's after having it on battery saver otherwise it just drains a bit too quick. All in all, it just feels like the Note 10+ 5G really but does look better from the outside.",
            "Dont love it at all nothing but trouble with it too my old note 9 wish I didn't get note 20 now may go to apple next time and I hate apple phone",
            "I love having the stylus but as a phone I find it slow and cumbersome. Features slow to work and unlock features inferior to older Samsung models!",
            "A decent phone. Speed is good. Camera is superb. Nice features. S pen is also smooth and swift. But only one downside is that the phone heats up after  use of camera or video call.  Should be better.",
            "Love the gaming cloud feature that I have recently discovered via xbox, really good add bonus and easy to setup. Lots of features the only thing I miss from my old galaxy s series phones is the blinking light in various colours to tell u that u had notification as sometimes u don't hear/feel the phone n no quick visual light means a message can sit for a while. But other than that great phone.",
            "I love this phone the colours is amazing the sharpness of the s pen is great and love the camera best phone ever",
            "It is very smooth I love the new and improved s pen I would recommend everyone to buy it",
            "Good phone not as fast as an s20 and two different processors mine is the slower one",
            "The camera is truly amazing and has so much detail, I love it! The battery could be better but it is good anyways.",
            "Smooth + slick. Camera - amazing. What more you want me to say?",
            "This is third Note.  Previously  I saw an immediate  step up with the new device.  Other than the camera I can't  see any big improvements.",
            "Best phone I have ever owned. Works really well. The battery and performance of the phone is excellent.",
            "I am a long time note fan, rocking a Galaxy Note from the times of the Note 3 and I have been in love with the series since and I have loved the improvements as time trickles on with me getting a massive sense of wow with each release having using the handsets for 2 years at a time. For the Note 20 Ultra however i got an initial sense of wow with the camera.... and thats been it really. The camera is amazing and the other features I'm happy with but a customed to. Thats not to say its not an amazing phone, it truly is but the wow factor comes from being surprised by something, I've not had that, but respectively I have had a reliable, functional and fast experience using the phone. If I was to give 1 purely negative comment though, it would be about the camera module itself. The module sticks out the back of the phones frame quite a bit and I work in the telecoms industry akin to construction and so there are frequent times my phone is subject to drops, scuffs and whatever, requiring a decent case. With the camera module being so big, getting a 100% shell that completely covers the phone is very difficult.",
            "Excellent product. Easy to use only problem is that the finger sensor can be tricky. \nPlus I didn't receive the ear buds",
            "Love the new Note 20 ultra, beautiful screen and decent battery life, had it for over a month now and I haven't been disappointed about anything so far.",
            "I love the addition of the s pen. It's much better than my clumsy fingers.",
            "It is too big.  Battery is not as good as they say.  Screen already tired.",
            "Nothing surprising, just a couple of Hertz and MB on the top. I expected more from a leader. Any Chinese brand will do the same.",
            "It has a huge range of features to make it work for both private and work applications  . The camera is 5 star and creates brilliant  images in all conditions",
            "I'm using note 20 ultra for 1 mount know brilliant everything except the baterry nice picture video it's great on youtube netflix it's going really smooth , but i'm really disappointed whit the baterry half a day it's keeping ne the baterry whit some settings that save battery this the only bad thing in rest brilliant phone",
            "I have always purchased the best mobile phone available since my first in the mid 1990's. When Samsung launched the original Note I purchased my first Samsung handset. There were some issues, but that stylus was a game changer for me. From that moment on I have had Samsung devices, but not always Notes. Some models were too similar to the last in performance terms or just not safe (only the one) so I have also owned the S7 Edge and S10. This note 20 Ultra is superb, but there are some problems. \nFirst the camera/s.\nThe negatives...\nI am a professional photographer so I seldom use the camera on my phone, but when I do I need it to be great quality and for it to operate quickly and reliably. The camera (and I imagine the software) on this phone are not good enough, I won't go into the obvious limitations of the optical design of the lenses being squeezed into an acceptable form factor, or the comparatively tiny sensors that need to be used. The bottom line is that if we strip away the bells and whistles of super wide angle and telephoto options and the ridiculously high pixel dimensions, the images my old Note 9 took (for my needs) are on the surface just as good as the Note 20. There is a ridiculous amount of interpolation going on (I just want optical 'zoom' please, not digital) the video at all resolution seems noisy and colour is rather strange at times.The killer issue is the speed... it is almost impossible to capture an image of ANTYHING that is not static. This needs to be resolved ASAP, the phone should not have come to market with this issue it is unacceptable\nThe positives...\nThe distortion control and auto exposure algorithms are very good, it is useful to have the extreme wide angle and the night shot images are superb, very well controlled on the luminance noise front which produces a very natural looking\nimage. Continuous AF and subject tracking are also very good (rendered useless with the glacial shutter lagg of course). Once the major flaws are resolved this phone will I'm sure capture superb imagery.\nThe other big issue is the screen. As usual images look superb on this device, however, only being able to reap the benefits of 120Hz at a much reduced resolution is very disappointing and more worrying is the flickering I have noticed at both 60Hz and 120Hz and different pixel dimensions. It has only happened a handful of times, very briefly, but I have never had this issue with any other Samsung handset. To summarise, superb build quality, superb design and features, but some very annoying and frankly disappointing flaws which I hope are just software related.",
            "I honestly believe this phone is perfect, from battery life to camera performance - the unit is an absolute beast! I have the Exynos version but I don't find the difference between the 2 chips as polarising as everybody suggests, as I am extremely happy with the product!",
            "Love the phone no faults Samsung's are so good highly recommend",
            "I will get the things I'm not happy with out of the way first. Charging the phone is so much slower than the previous note. There is no blinking notification light, In case you briefly leave the room. I would have preferred the pen on the right hand side but no big deal. Having said that, I think this is hands down the best phone on the market. I love it",
            "Big Screen, with deep colours.  Does everything I need from a phone, looks and feels good.  Battery not great though.",
            "best phone ive had so far is expensive but for price do get a lot",

            "Great phone, sleak and easy to hold despite the size. S Pen is amazing too. No problems with the software or hardware, battery with full use can last a day with 15-20% left. Only thing is that when wireless or wired charging, the phone can get hot to touch but with a case on it's barely noticeable though.",

            "I've had every note phone and this is just as all notes are a big phone with a pen.

            "the only issue is battery life its beyond bad even in economy mode only thing that spoils it",
            "Love the camera great features with lots of controls. Really enjoy using the pen, I always spell correctly using the pen in handwriting mode saves time and effort. Overall phone speed is great xbox gameplay in 5G areas is brilliant.",
            "This is my first experience with the note brand.  I have previously has the S series, and my last one was a S10 plus ceramic edition.  The note has the same ultrasonic fingerprint reader and I find it 50/50in terms of reliability. Because of this I have registered both thumbs twice so that I have a better chance, and although this helps I don't think I should need to do this for a device that is priced quite high. The battery performance is also a little disappointing.  Again for such a high price point I was expecting a little more.  Another niggle would be that I am not able to have a higher screen resolution at 120hz, and there may be some battery management going on which is limiting the use of higher screen resolution with max refresh rate. The biggest gripe has to be that in the rest of the world we get the in-house Exynos chip, but compared with the Qualcom Snapdragon chip that is inferior.  I feel that for a device that is priced in this bracket, we should be getting the best chip battery life and refresh rate and max resolution.  Having said that apart from those gripes, the phone itself is a product that is nearly perfect.",
            "The device fast and easy to use highly recommended",
            "The screen on this phone is by far the best best I've had on any smart phone (and I've had quite a few flagship phones). The colour the size is great to look at.\n\nThe speakers are also on another level compared to my previous phones. When watching a video or gaming, the stereo sounds is so good you will come to find yourself immersed into the video/game.\n\nThe downside to the phone I must say is the battery life. While it's far from terrible, I feel like this is the one area preventing this phone from being perfect. I can tend to go from morning till late evening a charge. However beyond this, it's pot luck if your battery is empty or not.\n\nHopefully this can be improved with a software update. The final thing that quite annoys me is the fact the the phone is expensive and the youtube app will not play videos at 1440p. Not quite sure if this is an issue with the youtube app or the phone. Either way, I'm quite sure that this can quickly be resolved with a software update.",
            "Love the new biometrics  on phone and its so easy to set up",
            "The Note 10 was a perfect blend. Everything worked well. However this phone seems to have gone backwards, apart from the excellent 120hz refresh rate screen everything else seems a step back. Battery doesn't hold up, camera isn't as sharp, random freezes while using basic apps like Chrome.",
            "Overpriced. Wouldn't get another. Definitely stick with samsung. But next time something like s20 standard",
            "Here in the UK the note 20 ultra doesn't seem to be the best option with the different chips being used compared to the US. This impacts the speed drastically. Its not slow by any means but to buy the same phone as someone in America and they get totally different internals is wrong. Furthermore, the camera focus issues we saw on the S20 ultra has not been resolved 100% even with the addition of laser focus. The only thing I really love is the 120hz screen but that isn't special to Samsung\n\nWait for the next one guys.",
            "So this phone is by far the best Note, it's great. Looks the part, works the part, is incredible. Only down side about the phone is the battery life, I expected it to have a longer life and it doesn't. It dies a little to fast for me, still better then a IPhone but my Note9 had a better battery life.\n\nAll round it's the best Note I've had.",
            "Everything about the phone is fantastic especially the cameras.",
            "I would of gave this a 5 star if it was the snapdragon modal but due to it being the older exanos chip and the battery not being the best but overall its a great phone not sure the price tho",
            "After scouring through hundreds of reviews screaming the positives and negatives, with a visible dissapointment in many of them, I decided to take the plunge and upgrade from my Note 9. I will never look back! So many features that improve this phone ten fold when all the reviews overlooked them. The screen is actually incredible, its so bright, clear and easy on the eyes. Games run smooth and gives me a competitive edge + 5g speeds are great, I dont always use 5G but when I get it I make the most of it. The camera is fab although I havnt used it much. The stylus is sleek and more useable than the Note 9 pen which was small, thin and flimsy. Highly recommend, don't hesitate!",
            "Its a great phone, only downside is the battery doesn't last as long as previous phones.",
            "I absolutely love all the features and functionality of note 20 ultra except battery life. Sometimes I am not getting even 4 hours of screen on time.",
            "Had the the Note 20 Ultra since release day, the camera had impressed me as I use it a lot and it produces great photos and video with ease. One UI is great these days and it has so many great features, my favourite being the edge panels. Unfortunately I can't give it a 5 star as with multiple recent Samsung devices I've had, the battery life lets it down. Where on other phones I have been able to finish a day with ~30%, this phone is often nearly or is dead by then. A heavy day can definitely wipe the battery out before end. Fix the battery and it's a 5 star perfect phone.",
            "Was expecting more to tell the truth my note 9 is just as good. The camera is better on the note 20 but the phone keeps freezing.",
            "Everything about phone appeals to me\n have always used samsung phones with no problems",

            "Love all the features and the accessories - fabulous to keep on track with fitness and love the pen!",
            "The phone can get slow or loses signal often and has to be restarted apps tend to turn off on their own accord doesnt allow incoming calls whiles on another call the earphone port is annoying as i cant charge and use them at the same time lots of things wrong with this phone",
            "Love the note 20 ultra best phone to date fast smooth 120 hrtzs speed screen amazing quality cameras great to one of the best phones of 2020",
            "I've had every Samsung phone throughout the years and this has to be my favourite. It has everything in the palm of my hand, general day stuff i.e text, emails, calls  .then you have the office too. then at the end of the day, I can play my Xbox  from anywhere,",
            "I also have an iPhone 11 pro max. I was using it as my daily driver. However ios14 is so unstable. I'm back to my trusty Note 20. Which is an excellent phone. Great battery life. Screen is perfect. Lots of storage. Fast. Bud's+ are also an excellent addition. Paired with the Garmin watch what more could you want.",
            "I love my note 20 ultra it's a great phone packed with awesome features, my only complaint is the battery life could be better not a good as my Galaxy 20 Ultra...",
            "The Note 20 Ultra is a great phone and accommodates my every need on a daily basis. With the power to perform at high end business needs, it really is the “do all” phone of the modern era. My only issue is the battery life. At high end usage, i.e. resolution and refresh rate, i have to charge the phone mid day to keep me productive for remainder of the day. That’s my only complaint, and i would definitely recommend this phone to anyone!",
            "Love this phone and the S-Pen is brilliant (fun with that brilliance of work too)!!!",
            "I love a lot about this phone. I love the pen and being able to have photos without holding the phone. And the new things you are do with the pen. I love the size of the phone\nThe only thing I would say is it come with bad headphones. I think it should come with Bluetooth and the phone is expensive",
            "It's a good phone but honestly I'm not sure its worth the money. The camera tries to be too clever to the point it struggles to focus properly when taking a simple picture. I have to keep it on medium power saving to get a whole day out of the battery and I have to take it out of my pocket to sit down.",
            "Great phone. Does everything fast and easy. Only thing, was i kept noticing a very fine mark behind the screen. I thought it was the screen protector. I peeled it off. Of course the scratch is on the devastated. No point contacting anyone as they will say I did it.\nMay not buy a Samsung product again.",
            "I upgraded from the Galaxy Note 9 and was insanely suprised by how powerful the Galaxy Note 20 ultra 5G performance. Out of this world camera and the S pen has improved to another level. The battery life covers my daily use and I have a busy daily use. Great Phone .",
            "Best phone I've ever had. Love the note series, but this phone beats them all, the size, the large amount of storage etc.  I look after my phone like it's my birthday. The  cost?  As always, the saying goes, \"you get what you pay for\"  Did I say, \" I love my phone\"?  I love my phone. Lol.",
            "I updated from the note 10 plus apart from the  120 fresh rate and the camera and a frew more another things on it its just the same phone from the note 10 plus l don't like the price at all the price is just to god dam high but apart from that its fantastic I love the back of it the glossy back on the note 10 plus was a finger print magnet don't get much use out of the 5G the place were i live does not support 5G signals",
            "After several months of using the Note 20 Ultra, I can confirm it is awesome, from wireless dex to the fantastic S-Pen, I could list everything that's great about this device and I would be here all day, I have only found 1 negative thing in all the time I have been using it, and that is battery life, I seem to typically get from 9.00am when I take it off its charger a full 12 hours, then it needs to be charged again or sometimes before (depending on how much I use it). I really wish it could last longer, but the device is used a lot and if you watch media on it or use wireless dex the battery does drain faster (as you would expect). Do not let this put you off of the device though, Im a heavy user and when the device is as good and as useful as this one, it will get used a lot.",
            "I like the concept of the phone, brilliant screen with lots of RAM and storage capability.,\nWhat lets it down is the poor decision to use an Exynos processor in lieu of the Qualcomm available outside the UK. This SoC impacts performance including photography and more importantly results in insufferable battery life. Very disappointed in you Samsung.",
            "The things I like about this phone is the camera. Omg its so crisp and just perfect it puts all the other phones in my house to shame and they are as new as this one  other things are the messages well predictive tx as im Dyslexic and just this whole product and the fact it comes with a pen what I can use. I've not even finished setting this phone up the way I like my phones and I'm just so pleased this is the phone I got its so much bigger than other phones too.  I can watch my YouTube or other platforms on this and not have to have it so close to me.\nThis is just such a good phone I'm even trying to get my wife to switch from her iPhone 11 \nOver all this phone is great in every way a must have for someone on the go",
            "I have always had Samsung phones, and in my opinion this is the best yet.",
            "The note 20 ultra is the best phone I have purchased in a long time. Starting my android journey story the s4 I have not looked back since. The screen on the Samsung phones are the highlight and its like when you pick up a book. You can't wait to see inside and its the same with the n20u. There are not really any issues however please see my suggestions below for future releases.\nAn option on the drag down to eject the s pen.\nFace recognition to be better in dark light. \nSnapdragon in all models. \nA screen on back of phone to draw your own design on the back. \nPower button on left side. \nFlip note for 2022.\nWell done on making another top class phone.",
            "Its a great phone has good features the only issue I'm having at the moment is it keeps dropping calls and sometimes I can't hear the other side.",
            "I love this phone amazing camera rear and front pen is very useful.",
            "I used the mobile for couple of days I don't say any problem with it love the phone it is like a power house, i like the Spen beautifully created and works like a charm.",
            "Freezing from time to time, I really want to tell good thing about the phone but for me was disappointed that such a expensive device. I used to have a mid range device and no prob at all.",
            "Had for 2 months now and only marginal significant differences over my old Note 9. Battery very poor, cameras good but so are most high end phones.",
            "Av always used a Samsung phone in this has to be the best one ever defo recommended",
            "I love the 120hz refresh and the note20 ultra has arguably many features, however one issue is battery drainage and I'm noticing it more as I'm used to phones that last all day with no issue other than that the phones amazing and it does turn heads.\n\nAnother issue i have is pricing, the fact i have to turn off a majority of features to allow the battery to last longer is a big issue for myself and at this price point its not worth the money at this current stage, don't get me wrong this is a great phone but it definitely can be improved.\n\n I love the design of this device from the unboxing experience and even until now I still remember opening the box and just going wow at that bronze finish along the outline of the device my scores are based off the fact that there is always room for improvement regardless of what your reviewing but however the device is just amazing and I'd love to see where samsung go with it in the future.",
            "Several deficiancies noticable on smule app compared to iphone",
            "The screen is really sharp, good pixels.\nThe camera is awesome, the photos taken from it are of top quality.\nBattery is surprisingly great, my previous Samsung phones struggled with battery, but this is great.",
            "I think I would describe myself as not so productive and thinking buying a phone to make me more productive would make a difference sounded silly to me. I do notice that I get a lot more done now and the jam packed features of the phone really encourages you to make use of them and keep up to date. As being my first flagship phone as in top of the range with the max storage I went for the mystic bronze and 512GB of storage. So far the phone hasn't let me down at all only finding myself on a few occasions running low or running out of battery probably due to the fact that I was using it so much on them particular occasions. I normally top up my phone here and there now rather than go for a full charge. It really is a great device and leaves nothing to be wanted for in terms of technology and features and paired with the Galaxy Buds Live it makes it all a great experience nothing like I've experienced before. The camera is a brilliant piece of technology the only thing that annoys me about it is the standard shutter delay when taking a photo so If your taking a photo of something moving sometimes comes out in a blur, however that being said it normally captures what your looking for and the static photography more than makes up for that with real crispy feeling images that rival some big cameras, they really have came a long way in this development compared to a few years ago and the video is absolutely brilliant. Only reason I'm going with 4* overall is due to the blur in the camera but I could probably sort that out with shooting in pro mode and adjusting the settings. I'm sure I will only grow more towards the phone with more use, ooh and never thought id use a stylus but this one I find myself using all the time its great !!!!",
            "Got my phone just over a month ago and it's a massive upgrade from my S9 plus. Good battery camera shame it's gone a weaker chip compared to the us version.",
            "I've had Notes for a long time now but this one is the best.\nIt has great features, an excellent camera and is a powerhouse.",
            "I am very pleased with phone, inparticularly the screen quality. However I do find the signal the phone receives compared to my last S9+ is worse, in my house where I would normally pick up 4G I do not anymore. This is quite annoying.",
            "As a first time note user I can say that this is a great phone all features are as you would expect from a top end phone. I love the S-pen although it would have been nice to have a spare in the box as this is a premium price phone. I understand that times are difficult at the moment and samsung have shipped the phone with not many extras, personally at the price I paid I would expect  a whole host of goodies, but not even a case to protect the phone while I waited for them to be produced. I'm not sure why samsung used there own chip instead of the Qualcomm...?? Maybe the device could have been a bit cheaper, had a few software issues at the start but I think they are sorted now. I am still getting to grips with all its features though. All round a good phone.",
            "loving the camera and the S Pen, so responsive and accurate in recognising my hadwritting",
            "Been a Samsung owner since the start of your endeavour to mobile phones.\nLove them as meet my requirements.\nNote 20 ultra 5G great screen and camera love it.......but one can't help but think as coming from the UK.......and I can't run a games at full resolution because of dropped frame rates because I have your samsung processor and not the snapdragon :-(  .\nI have seen the comparison videos between the two 2 and there's a massive drop in performance using the Samsung processor yeah I still have to pay the same price for an inferior processor!!.\nI would recommend and the note 20 Ultra 5G to a friend but only with the Snapdragon processor, absolutely love the phone but can't help but wonder what it would of been like with the snapdragon processor so left wanting.",
            "Its the same as my old S9+. No innovation. I am not impressed.",
            "This phone does everything you need a phone to do the best of the best",
            "Coming from a note8 its a big jump in performance and speed of the device.  \n\nHowever disappointing battery life with uk exynos version being significantly lower than snapdragon.  Also having the system files taking up nearly 50gb is ridiculous - nearly the entire capacity of my previous phone.",
            "I love how responsive it is and it does everything I need it to do.",
            "The phone and all new features are great. \nAgain like the last note. A poor battery performance let's this down. Not even heavy usage and by mid to late afternoon I'm having to charge.",

            "I low the screen, the 120hz is incredibly smooth and the colours and display are bright and vibrant. However I do wish we would be able to have 120hz with QHD instead of dropping to 1080p. Kinda seems silly to lower a key feature with is  resolution of a display to enjoy the feature of another.",
            "Cant fault it cant say theres any flaws on the s20 note ultra, great camera, great for gaming, great picture etc, long battery the best samsung i have had yet",
            "This phone has lots of very good features and options that make it really cool. My only complaints are the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and how most screen protectors will not work.",
            "I have had about 15 Android devices since 2009 and for the last 6 years I was exclusively using Google's own devices. But to be honest I was kinda getting bored with the oversimplicity of stock Android,  and I felt like jumping to a Samsung device again (my last was the S3). I have not been disappointed. I love the level of depth Samsung's One UI offers, while at the same time it's stylish and understated.\nThe Note 20 Ultra 5G has a great screen, great sound, great top end camera (I'm loving the zoom particularly) great build quality, but most of all is crammed packed with software features that I like. The Bixby routines are especially cool as they allow me to configure the device automatically depending on where I am or what I'm doing. The S pen is also a great feature to have. I have read that not all Note users actually make use of it, but I've found it really handy to take and store quick notes at work. The screen is so large that the device is certainly big enough to use as a notepad. The only thing about the phone that I would say could be better is the responsiveness and accuracy of the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. I know it's more secure than a camera fingerprint sensor but it's just not as quick and reliable.\nStill back to the good things - I have been impressed with Samsung's recent pledge to support its phones with 3 years of software and security updates. Coming from Pixel phones this was important to me and was the final thing I needed to hear to make me switch back to Samsung. So far I have been very impressed with the speed and regularity of the updates the phone has had.\nAll in all I would certainly recommend the Note 20 Ultra. It's the complete package and although it's not cheap, it's completely unique in what it offers. As I purchased it through Samsung's upgrade programme, I think I may now be sticking with Samsung devices for the foreseeable future.",
            "Thought my note 8 was good until I upgraded to this monster! Can't fault it. Makes my note 8 look very outdated when comparing. Battery still needs improvement tho. Only lasting 24 hours even when on abs minimum settings",
            "I compared this to the note 10 as that was my last phone which I thought was great but lacked in battery, camera specs and a few other things. This tops all phones I've had, great camera, not to big or heavy, quick, clear, crisp viewing and use. I feel like it knows what I like in a phone and is catering itself for me straightout the box. Wont be changing it in a hurry!\n\nPosting 4 on value only because prices are always high and who wouldnt like a great phone cheaper. Haha",
            "Slowly fingerprint,  and i really expected snapdragon on it.",
            "Powerful phone, wish there was a headphone jack however the bluetooth quality is great too. Love it, only real negative would be the camera buldge.",
            "Keeps crashing. Apps slow.  Internet slower than my note 9. Which was exelent.",
            "As always with the note models, Samsung exceed expectations, build quality is fantastic and feels great, Camera is incredible, battery life will last all day and with super fast charging the phone never gets empty,",

            "I am absolutely delighted to have this amazing handset.\nHowever, after setting auto focus I still having some blurry macro photos.\nIf this is fixed phone really deserves 5 stars.",
            "The phone is really really good .....i.m not sure if this is a common problem but mine when i move it you can here a little sound inside ( like something is moving inside, like something is broken) but it works perfectly.",
            "Great phone although lacking in the chip set but still a power house of a phone none the less",
            "Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great",
            "Having had the screen covered since the second it was bought with an official clear view cover cannot believe it is scratched already.Had a note 8 for 3 years with less visible marks.",
            "I have swapped from a note 9 I can't say upgraded as in many ways this phone is excellent but as an actual phone it is inferior from the note 9 to the point where I'm either getting another sim for my 9 so I can make business call or just got g back to using the 9 during the week I am very disappointed but it is a great device in many ways it is such a shame ....",
            "So far this seems like a superb piece of tech. The only downside is the battery life which I would expect to be longer",
            "My Galaxy Note20 Ultra is a great phone. I love it. It feels premium and is clearly for me the best phone on the market currently. However their are a couple of small things that could have made this perfect. Firstly the big one is the Chipset, the exynos just doesnt compare to the snapdragon, seems madness that I don't get the best chipset for the phone. I would prefer a flat screen, it looks beautiful but a flat screen is so much more practical. 120hz is lovely, the screen is beautiful but seems a little mad I can't have WQHD+ and 120hz at the same time. Finally the biggest thing is the price. It is the most expensive phone on the market, and it is amazing but I believe there has been a few decisions to stop it being perfect. I love my phone, the S Pen is great, the screen is beautiful, its a good size, the intergration with Windows is a huge feature for me, the camera is obviously incredible. I wouldnt have another phone on the market if I was looking for premium, the cost is huge but the phone is great. If I didn't want the S-Pen and some of the additional features, the S20 FE looks like a great cheaper alternative.",
            "An improvement on the S10 which is an exceptional device, seems more responsive and the larger screen helps with multitasking. Good Camera and Stylus works well.",
            "I would happily the device was a few millimetres  thicker to get a better battery.",
            "I love the slick design and ease of use of this phone. Great large screen and so many features...brilliant phone!",
            "Love the size of the screen and the accessibility to  use the pen",
            "I have always owned a note phone, starting with a note 2, as I love the features especially the S pen which I use often, I have always rated previous phones with a 5*, but with my note 20 ultra I have noticed serious scratches on the screen, even though I am using a flip case. Apart from this fairly major disappointment the phone itself is as good as it always was and I would not even consider anything different.",
            "After using this phone for a few days now I can say simply Phenomenal.\nThe speed is ridiculous the functions and system is well set up and the pen facility is an added extra on top. Finally the camera, its more like binoculars outrageous zoom with no distortion.\nThis is by far the best phone I have ever used. I am now selling an i phone 11 Pro max 512gb as I have no use for this anymore. Seriously outstanding",
            "By far the best Note experience so far! Just one issue, black model has fingerprint issues on back of phone. Better with the copper version, but would be better with that feature in black..",
            "Having gone from iPhone back to Samsung, I can honestly say that they have come a long way since I had the s5! The note 20 ultra 5g is a very fast user friendly phone and not that much bigger than the s10+ which was my last phone.\n\nThe image and picture quality as well as the stability is amazing and the s-pen allows for easy and simple form filling too or editing pics and even ease of note taking.",
            "The photos come out stunning.  But it's now 11am. Had the phone going since 8am. Battery is at 53%. Battery life is shocking.  I've also had issues with image retention on the screen and Samsung wouldn't swap it.",
            "The pen feel poor, also the phone its self dosent feel like much of an upgrade theres no wow factor",
            "the note 20 ultra is the number 1 smartphone of toady great features brilliant desing and very reliable flawless in tasking and gaming and fantastic camera to capture those memorable moments in perfect detail",
            "The phone a great, only slight grip is the rear camera, sticks out a bit,other wise beautiful functional phone with some great features.",
            "It's worth buying for the camera alone, but there are so many great features it's impossible to list them all.  Night mode on the camera is amazing!",
            "The S Pen is amazing particularly enjoy colouring with it.",
            "Lovely screen, the pen is fantastic and great for taking selfies on holiday.",
            "Its VERY expensive fragile and the camera really isn't that great but the spen is the business and is useful everyday battery life is ok again nothing great then there is its size its big very big.",

            "A beautiful phone with great features and battery to last a day!",
            "I love the new s20 ultra. The battery life us great, things I can do with the phone is amazing, love the Pen features. Pictures quality is great",
            "Preferred my old s9. Nothing special.  The pen is not unique in anyway. Cameras are standard to most phone. Woukd suggest people wait for new phone to be realised.",
            "I bought this phone on contract about 2 months ago now and I am in love. The comparison from the Samsung Galaxy s10+ that I had before to this is unreal, the quality is crazy good. This is the first note I've had and I love the pen feature, its really smooth and I find myself using it all the time.\nHowever, I have only given the phone 4 stars because it does get quite hot when I'm charging it or using it for long periods of time, and once when I was using it the screen went completely black and was unresponsive. This only happened once but it was like this for about 2 hours which obviously shouldn't happen.",
            "this is the worst phone i have ever owned, graphics are rubbish, camera is low quality, zoom is non existent just huge blur.\ni switched to oppo find x2 pro and i can say that oppo is way better in all ways then Samsung galaxy note 20 ultra",
            "Samsung note 20 has all the features of a Samsung but the camera is excellent and the additional pen is great for writing nots",
            "Disappointed with phone, awful battery life and overheats (crappy exynos)\nCan't recommend at this price!!!!",
            "So easy to use especially as I've had samsungs now for quite a few years, camera is amazing, also the processor speed is far faster than previous model.",
            "Powerful. Good battery. Great camera. \nVery attractive looking phone.  Only negative is the cost.",
            "I have been a Samsung user since the s2 and I have loved all of the new technologies introduced each and every year, the Galaxy Note 20 ultra 5G has to be my all time favourite, I have had it since launch and I am still finding new features everyday. Love the S pen gesture feature, the phenomenal camera, build quality is superb as always, the dual app open feature is so productive and the reading other reviews I was a bit confused over battery life as I get a full days use out of mine and if by any chance I use more than normal the fast charge is awesome. This is my first note in a few years and I must say I am glad I waited to try this as it truly is top end technology with an amazing vibrant responsive screen.",
            "I love the phone the size is perfect the camera is amazing. Only problem is the battery don't last",
            "Speeds are awful my phone crashes trying to play Spotify and just loops music. Brightness is rubbish in daylight",
            "having had my phone for roughly 3 weeks now, i am thoroughly enjoying all the new features. my only issue is the battery performance - seems to loose charge quickly and as i am a heavy user, i seem to be charging constantly",
            "It has great features and is so easy to use would recommend to anyone",
            "all over phone is good apart battery timing \ndesign is good performance is good as well but battery drains like a joke",
            "Great phone apart form the battery life. Having come from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro I am used to easily getting at least 2 days of use from a single charge. The Note 20 Ultra allows me to get through a day, but it is close some days. When will phone companies get the simple things sorted ? Battery life is one of the most important features, yet they all think that barely getting through a day is acceptable.",
            "You can take far away photos when you zoom and its pretty sharp photos",
            "Its a great device, great charging and lightning quick. I just wish you could turn of the smoothing feature on the camera, pictures look like they are finger paintings when you zoom in. It is really awful, at 108mp. And the shutter lag on max res at 108mp is ridiculous, about 1 sec for a capture, so as long as you don't want captures anything that's moving and you have a steady hand its ok.",
            "I had about 100 phones in my life and im not a reviewer even if i would like to be - Samsung;) . For last 5, 6 years I was deeply in the Apple ecosystem and I didn't want to hear about android. Then a year ago I've spotted Samsung galaxy Note 10 in the shop. I couldn't belive how great was the phone and the one UI from Samsung. I loved that phone from day one. Unfortunately after few months I had to sell it but I couldn't wait until new Note will come out. And there he is! Im not disappointed at all. I would give 5 stars but the battery life is a bit of concern. Overall I definitely recommend that phone to everyone. It is so flexible and advanced model ever. You will find everything in one piece of advanced technology in the palm of your hand. Grat device and it will never let you down that's for sure.",
            "I upgraded from Note 9, which I loved having had various Notes over time.  The fingerprint on front screen was a challenge in getting used to the phone as I pick it up in my left hand, so my pointing finger is perfectly placed for rear print sensor.  Anyways having now sussed that out, im good with this Note.\n\nThe pen is more powerful so learning not to hold it near the screen when I sign in.\n\nSpeed is the main benefit of this phone and the camera is amazing \n\nI'm such a poor photographer (I cut peoples heads off shots  or have shaking hands for example) and even I produce great pics \nusing it.\n\nAll in all a great phone that I have no plans of changing for a good while.\n\nAlso can I add that I love Samsung BTS collaboration",
            "Powerphone. Say no more. Quality pictures. Quality battery life. Absolute madness from Samsung.",
            "Really enjoy the galaxy notes, i use the pen way more than i thought and i really like the big screen, i was really interested in the new galaxy fold and had it come with an s pen and a better camera, then i would of definately been sold...i just feel that for a premium price you should be getting a phone with the best of everything over and above the rest....maybe next year!\nIn the meantime the note20 ultra is a great compromise.",
            "Currently enjoying using note 20 ultra. Amazing features and easy to use.",
            "Had this phone or as you guys like to call it, \"a powerhouse mobile\", for roughly 2 months and its going phenomenal. Major round of applause for what you've created and managed to do with a premium phone. Camera performance is on par with high end cameras and the sound of videos and music is immense. Would recommend getting this phone to feel the hype behind the promotions.",
            "it can be seen from afar that it is a premium phone",
            "Incredibly excited to have recieved my Note 20 ultra, with its 120hz display (only in adaptive and cant be used with 4k) and the outstanding camera.\n\nUnfortunately these features mean nothing if it doesn't have a battery that can keep up, I am having to avoid many of these features to ensure at least 3 quarters of a day of usage. If I don't I will have to charge my phone in bursts multiple times throughout the day",
            "Good fotos all good  just ecspenses .good good thanks k",
            "Have been an iPhone user for decade and was searching for the real deal. Note20 Ultra you beauty. Never regrets buying this awesome gadget  . But please fix the the heating issue on exynos 990.",
            "I feel some features were better on my Note8.\nObviously the camera is excellent. But other features have not improved much since Note8",
            "As far as phones go the note 20 ultra is a great one, however the downsides to the device are the battery life and the processor, I barely get a day out of the battery and thats barely using it, I have it constantly on medium power saver, and that still drains the battery quickly, I can barely use the functions of the device without the battery running down quickly, as for the processor its not the greatest either, if I could go back in time I would have probably got the note 10+ 5G, however the design of the device is one of the best I've seen, it feels nice in hand, the screen resolution is fantastic too, I just wish it had a better battery so I could use the device functions properly without the battery running out quickly",
            "I love this device,  however I was wondering my smartphone display.  I was recently purchased samsung galaxy back case  ,like full case .  Its looks better  my case , but not safe my display,  I got some scratches in my edge display.",
            "Personally think is over priced coming from Huawei P30 PRO/ S8+ don't notice much in terms of speed/ display",
            "It keeps switching on by itself when in your pocket. Bluetooth seems poor. No real improvement on 9.",
            "Lovely phone to use, great screen perfect for consuming content.\nOnly down side that I have found is the battery is not as good as my previous apple phone",
            "So over the years I have switched between Apple and Samsung. I use my phone a lot and upgrade every year. My switching days are now over. Since the Galaxy Note 10 plus and now the Note 20 Ultra 5G I haven't even wanted to pick up an Apple device. \n\nI use the phone for everyday use, watching movies, listening to audio books and playing games with my family, (Call of Duty mobile, Fortnite). \n\nFast connectivity, brilliant cameras, a beautiful screen and awesome gaming experience. The stylus is easy to master and provides excellent hands free control. \n\nThe only phone I would upgrade to would be the next Note Ultra.",
            "It's pretty and the camera is great, but have focus issues. Lots of cool features. Overall, I like it.",
            "nothing really stands out. performance wise it feels like the like the note 9",
            "The new Note 20 Ultra is great. Love the feel and the quality of the photos. However the position the power button and volume button on the same side make it uncomfortable to take screenshot (literally have to change how you hold the phone to take the screenshot). Also, because they are so close often when wanting to adjust volume,  you turn your screen off, or when wanting to turn the screen on you are actually pushing the volume button instead. Definitely worse positioning on this model. Also the keyboard has a flaw that in the last model had been solved and now is back. The keyboard switches to symbols while you are typing and then you have to go back and start over.",
            "This phone is amazing with all the great functions and professional apps. My only grape was that when I purchased the phoned the claim for the ear buds were not valid due to the fact the sky don’t produce prof of purchase even when you send them your ser no screenshots softhearted purchase of the phone.",
            "This phone is very powerful and very fast. Switching between apps is very fast and snappy, the camera is clear and has some great features like the night shot mode which is actually really good but if you know about photography then the pro feature will be what you want, I personally don't understand it but my brother does and he said that the different settings you can tune is very very good.\n\nI biggest stand out feature of this phone is the S pen and I absolutely love it!! As soon as you pop it out it rings out a menu and you can chose from learning to draw and paint to taking a snap of the screen and being able to fully edit it all on the screen you were on, no having to navigate to a separate app, it's all in front off you straight away and I love it, I've sent multiple pics and docs about the page I was on and I can show them what I was looking at by highlighting it or cutting out that section and just sending that part. It's just a great thing to do and it's easy. Writing, drawing, painting is seemless and very precise and once again, it's fun.\n\nI can't say much else apart from this phone is amazing and I love it",
            "Great phone, incredible screen, fast and packed with super cool features. Only concession might be the battery life, but that may be an exynos issue. It's a good battery life, that will last you all day, but would like to see an extra 20% on it to make it more comfortable.",
            "Disappointed, huge camera which means that you need to buy protector to avoid getting scratched. After few weeks of use you will need to replace it because it gets blurry. The pen is flimsy, still not metal. Edges are still curved which there are still accidental touch and opening random apps. There are good points: screen is great size and clear, and, good performance. however the colours are not natural, cartoon like.",
            "Honestly can't fault this phone beautiful display,the picture quality is next level the sound is crisp and clear beautiful camera love the s pen and best of all great battery life average of 7-8 screen on time but I have got up to 9 hours some days. Well done samsung you've done us proud",
            "Battery life is very poor. Phone gets hot. Also audio is very laggy.  Wish I kept my old s10 plus now.",
            "Very good phone which can be used for various different tasks",
            "Easy to use, excellent features, great camera, bigger screen so easy and fast for downloading and watching films",
            "Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G comes with a high expandable memory via card slot, microSDXC (uses shared SIM slot), It offers a high internal memory of 128GB 12GB RAM, It has 256GB 12GB RAM, It has 512GB 12GB RAM that is very suitable for multitasking performance, It offers UFS 3.1, It offers lots of RAM & a large memory.",
            "The phone is a nice phone, big which i like. Only negative i have is battery life is awful!",
            "Great phone but battery let's it down. I'm back to charging my phone once a day instead of everyb2 to 3 days... too many background things going on. I've turned all I could find off but some still come back making the battery worse. other than that I'm happy with it",
            "From the camera to being able to play my xbox whilst out, the phone is just outstanding.\n\nI use it heavily for work and it does not disappointing.",
            "I do really like my new Samsung note 20 ultra.I had concern about the battery but the phone set itself so now it is all good now.",
            "Update from Note4, REALLY pleased with updates and new features.",
            "Great phone, great camera, great performance. My only gripe is the battery, I would like one that can easily last the day.",
            "I love this phone. Is what you dream. The only downside is the fingerprint sensor. It recognise my fingerprint just 2 in 10 or lower percentage. Especially when the phone is blocked. It may be just the software,  I don't know.",
            "The phone is good but the battery life is poor personally I feel a better battery is needed. As I work long days I need to have it on charge a lot to last the day.",
            "Screen quality very good thanks Samsung I hope next 4K screen",
            "I love my new phone, I use it every day all day and I didn't get bored of it as yet. The screen is just right and the pictures taken are amazing. I didn't useall features yet I am still learning.",
            "Its everything I would expect from the note the  Styling is spot on love it",
            "I eagerly waited fir the so called better phone. The battery life was better in my old Note 10 if anything I am using this less because I don't trust the battery to last all day. Nothing special",
            "I love it. Went from iPhone to this phone. Never go back to iPhone",
            "Amazing screen. Fast and powerful. Excellent camera. And of course the s pen.",
            "It's a great phone, great great camera. Would like to have more things to do with the S-Pen.",
            "Love the whole thing about the phone from picture quality right to screen quality",
            "Firstly, this is my first Note phone, as I usually stick to the flagship, Galaxy S series. However, I've been pleasantly surprised. \nOnce you get used to the size of the device in your pocket, you are going to be happier for having this model. \nThe most noticeable things are the screen resolution and quality, especially when watching sports; the ability to stream high quality without buffering, with the quickest refresh speed on social media that I've experienced. \nAnother highlight for me is the camera. The quality of pictures and videos are great; however I am still tweaking and playing with the interface to find my perfect settings. The Ultra Zoom allowed me to take a photo of the moon (attached). It is good for portraits and group photos too (attached). \n\nThe S-Pen is good. I've never had one before so initially I found it quite a gimmick, but there are uses - mainly for taking photos from a distance, but also if I'm sharing my phone with others but need to make sure I can quickly put them on the home screen if they stray to something they shouldn't see. \n\nI'm off to Mexico soon, and I'll be especially intrigued to see how this phone performs under water, taking videos and photos.",
            "Large screen which clearly displays whatever you call up. Easy to make your way around all the  included apps etc. Camera(s) take brilliant in focus photographs be they close-ups or wide angle vista's.",
            "very very laggy and slow phone battery life is rubbish not happy at all.",
            "A bit expensive but a quality phone. Great pictures and super fast.\nS pen is so handy and makes me do things so much quicker. \nPictures are superb. \nMy only gripe is the face I d\nIn certain light it will not pick up my face and unlock but my friend with an iPhone unlocks right next to me in the same light.",
            "Great phone, is a bit pricey but overall best on the market",
            "excellent, I upgraded from my Samsung S10+, I've always been a galaxy user so moving onto a Note I thought maybe different. the features with the SPen have been excellent, even though my S10 camera was good the note 20 takes on another level. \nI only dislike the battery as I thought it would last a-lot more longer than my expectation.",
            "The phone on the whole is good. Though I have been using Samsung for 10 years now and gone through a whole range of them. I was expecting this to be the one but it has been reasonable compared to others.\nUnfortunately, battery life is not great (expected as phone has many apps open, I guess), it seems to freeze unexpectedly and everything gets stuck, often and chrome too can be slow not sure if it is the app or the phone. .",
            "Note 10 plus batteries better than note 20 ultra..",
            "Battery just kept dropping! My 2 year old iPhone XS still lasted twice the time that the Note 20 did. So I returned this device and will wait for the iPhone 12.",
            "I loved the Note10 but this is a leap ahead, much faster, much clearer screen. Just a massive improvement",
            "I love everything about the note20 ultra ,but dont get why people in the uk get a worse processor ,if you could fix that issue the review wouldent have had a bad side !",
            "In truth I have had very little issue with the device so far. My one issue is the autofocus, specifically close up autofocus. I have about a 50% hit rate with anything under 1 metre away and the majority of the time I have succeeded its been a long time getting there with the camera focusing on multiple background objects before coming the the object of interest. \nThe latest update has brought some camera stability updates so we shall see over time.",
            "Very nice, unless you are upgrading from a note 10 5g plus, then its just a bit faster and a better camera",
            "ultimate phone for everyday use fast long lasting  battery screen clarity is epic everyone that holds my phone compliments the crystal clear screen",
            "I was unsure when i was reading reviews about whether to buy this phone as a step up from the s9 plus.",
            "I don't use the s pen enough and the battery life is terrible it was a hard choice to upgrade to this. It's disappointing that the phone gets so hot aswell. The phone is also way too slippery without a case.",
            "Bit of an anti climax, note features not that good",
            "Expected it to run cooler/have better cooling, runs rather hot",
            "I just can't see passed Samsung. Had an iPhone once before Samsung and it was so complicated to work whereas the Samsung is just as simple or complicated as you want it to be.",
            "Its decent, looks good qnd is nice and big but i regret buying it as the internet keeps crashing and no one seems to help me.",
            "The best phone I've had to date \nGreat camera good phone for chunky fingers",
            "I absolutely love this phone due to the incredible features Such as\nusing the pen to type. I previously had the samsung S9, and will now only buy the Note range. Itis the creme de la Creme of mobile phones.",
            "I've gone from a Samsung Galaxy S10e to the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G and I love it. Using the pen when doing my work is so easier now, the drawings that I do can all be done on my phone instead of needing my laptop and wacom to do this. And the camera omg amazing! Never been so in love with a phones camera",
            "Love the device camera quality is amazing \nAnd colour choice",
            "Smooth operation. great features and the camera is incredible.",
            "I use an apple issued phone as well as my personal Note 20.   Productivity wise the note 20 wipes the floor with pretty much anything currently on the market.  Only down side is the focus point on the Camera is very narrow compared to previous Notes and the IPhone.",
            "It's no where near as fast as I expected, it does have some great features but a brand new phone of this standard should not freeze on a few occasions",
            "The 5G feature seams useless as the battery won't last for more than 4hours, so unless you are not connected to o socket the 5G is not a feasible option.",
            "I have no idea how to use this phone moving from and iPhone . I wish there were some simple videos to be able to work through this . Samsung has not done their marketing well at all. Phone seems like it could do many things but I just use it as a phone as I don’t have time to sit and work out the nonsense.",
            "Gr8 device but some times screen unresponsive, other features are supberb love dex fantastic productivity, i am looking to move over to folding phones but waiting for the price to be realistic.",
            "Overall great phone. Battery is the weak link. Not sure if this is just in need of further updates to optimise. Very impressive camera.",
            "Super fast, very responsive, camera is just outstanding!",
            "my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with Exynos is a good product.  However it is not the same product as a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with Snapdragon and should not have the same name if there is that difference.  Snapdragon needs to be available in the UK",
            "Phone is good but not much better than my s9. Camera is much better quality but also not as good as seen on tv. Phones is rather slow also",
            "Great camera, love the zoom and size is great. Quality overall of look, features etc great but the battery is still not best when using phone a lot, could be bettet",
            "I love this phone, super fast, great features, great display a real massive step forward.",
            "Amazing phone. Stunning screen, great size, fast, powerful, nice to use.\n\nUnfortunately had to send mine back due to faulty screen (small dead area that looked like a black semi circle). Awaiting replacement.",
            "Great phone! Nice size screen very good touch sensitivity when using the pen.. only downfall is the cameras could be better and its not great with charge my last phone had a better  camera and that was an s10. Perfect for work and everyday phone.",
            "Love the phone, lovely picture, fast processing,everything checks out",
            "The built quality and the large screen size is awesome",
            "I love the picture quality its the best phone I've ever had",
            "Love all the features and great display can do all my work at home too just wish the battery would last I use my phone all day non stop and have to charge it at least 3 times",
            "Best mobile in the world i recommended to all my friends",
            "I love the screen size. The colour and the features\n\nI don't like battery performance it doesn't last",
            "I love the phone, its the best phone I have ever had the joy of using its just a shame that there is no case sent with the phone and trying to find one is proving to be a nightmare, would be a 5 star review if this was corrected as I find myself worrying about the condition daily",
            "Lots of ballyhoo but not a lot better than my last Samsung S10 Galaxy note 5G",
            "So Easy to Use. Camera is Excellent. Best phone ive had.",
            "1st phone had major issues with battery, replacement has been flawless.  I find the camera app uses up way to much battery & will not sleep.",
            "Really good phone. The camera is out of this world super fast charge and lasts me all day the phone does.",
            "I was away from Samsung for 2 years as i thought i would try another brand, I am so glad to be back, the features on the galaxy are amazing and so convenient! I wont be making that mistake again!",
            "Love the phone and its features. Still a terrible battery life.",
            "Love the colour, the glass finish and the smoothness",
            "The screen goes yellow and i have to restart the phone 3 and 4 times a day",
            "Battery life shocking i mean shocking shocking!!!!",
            "Clear screen, great camera, fast processing. Only down fall is the camera lens isn't flat to the phone so feels very unprotected",
            "I love this phone. Finally a phone i can call perfect.",
            "The mic on this phone is shocking as I need to use headphone if I can't hold my phone for the other side to hear. The battery life is really bad and phone keeps getting stuck as if its a old device.",
            "Amazing phone and good battery life, defintely good decision to select this, and I loved the bronze color. Camera is just the way I wanted it.",
            "I wish I never bought this phone. Droped it from waistline hight and 2 big crack appeared. Battery is really week,  won't get you through the day.",
            "Excellent design, perfect screean, briliant camera and loads of powerfull options but poor processor. You feel like you're driving a Ferrari ... but with a Fiat 500 engine.",
            "Nice device but battery life is not the best. I can spend a whole day without charging it",
            "The phone is amazing but the battery life is very bad compared to previous models for example Note 10 Plus.",
            "I have been using this phone for the past month now. It's a great phone. Awesome display, great quality sound, smooth, beautiful. No complaints but battery life should have been better. I am not sure whether this can be fixed by software update. But if it can, Samsung should do it quickly. I just love this phone and I don't want it to fail just because of one stupid reason.",
            "Very good recommend to everyone",
            "Recently I bought this fone, this is great fone with great great features I am looking. The camera result is awesome.  The design of this curvy much and more reliable.",
            "Phone is amazing, just sometimes batery doesnt stay for too long, but i managed to extended it",
            "I have always been a Apple fan until I bought the Samsung s20 Note ultra. Fantastic looking phone. Can do so much more than with Apple. Great features and the S Pen is great",
            "At this model as at my first samsung ever I was expected more \n1-the battery is not so great \n2-the sensor recognitionis so weak compare with iPhone(honest)",
            "My granddaughter wears a lanyard stating hidden disability as she is severely sight impaired, her samsung galaxy note 10 plus 5g was stolen in mcdonald's. I purchased this phone as a replacement from argos because of the brilliant price and quick availability. She loves this new phone, she is enjoying using the new features that the software on the phone offers. She particularly loves the size of the size of the screen.",
            "Been samsung boy since first ever phone which was still a flip phone.  Now an all note series fan. Cant wait to go all foldable when the tech evolve a bit. \nThe phone itself. \nThe screen. All I can say is you won't find anything like that. Its just the best. Colours,  contrast, Responsiveness, smoothness, brightness and the size. Curved edges, well I had them since s8  edge, cant remember what is flat screen. Speakers, man they totally blew me away. Loud, crisp, full and stereo mode is just a joy to watch content.\nCameras. Zoom, ultra wide, main camera. You got it. Nice crisp pictures. Sad to see dual aperture gone. The depth of field great. Focus, coming from note 9 I feel like its not 100% great but hey, the quality is much better of pictures and usually the struggle is when I try to take a close picture, I have to move it further focus and come close. However, no such issue if u use snapchat or Instagram, so I figure quick software tweak. \nFront facing camera. Its ok. Take selfies, focuses well quality is fine.\nBattery life. Could be better. Last a day with average usage, but if you love to play games on highest setting (with amazing screen and good specs, who doesn't?) It will go fast. I do not think anyone would mind thicker phone and bigger battery, so samsung please.\nExynos and snapdragon. Seriously samsung explain why. Either make your exynos shine like the tech beast company you are or just give me snapdragon. Step up your the game. To be fair cannot see a single issue with phone speed. No lags and its powerhouse. I love playing games and watching movies at same time. If game is intense and video is high res. The game starts to lag and phone heats up like a stove. But, common watching movie and play game at same time on one device. Its fine. 5g, god I just love it. Half terabyte of storage, you are spoiling us. \nOne ui. It is a heavy skin, nothing towards stock android. But it has evolved so much, the extra features, small tweaks here and there. Its a stock samsung. You either appreciate it or try something else.  But if you truly give it a try, you will find the appreciation for it. There is so much it offers you and you can make it as close to what you want as you can get. That to be said cant wait for you 3.0 version.\nThe design. It is stunning. I got the mystic black version. One sad thing, it doesn't have brushed glass feel, did not really knew when preordered that it is only for mystic bronze, would have gotten that maybe for a change. Camera bump doesn't feel anymore like an alien to the phone it is part of design and how its done its a stunner. The black colour is not your typical black. Its a changing colour from dark black to black grey. It looks great.\nAll in all it is a great phone. However, I can see that samsung is now getting focus on its new toy foldable. The company is all about innovation, can you blame them? While it is still in its infancy we have powerhouse note. Yes, I wish we had superior chipset (either better produced exynos or snapdragon), bigger battery, less bump or something else. But when I use this phone I do not think of them, all I think is God I love this phone.",
            "I really love this phone! The build quality is exceptional and the cameras are awesome. Having come from a Note 9 I love the wide-screen angle lens and 5x optical zoom. The image quality is super.\n\nThe phone is really fast and doesn't often get warm although I don't do gaming.\n\nThe battery life was actually pretty poor when I first got the phone but has improved massively since after installing the Aug 1st update and doing a factory reset. I decided to do the latter anyway as decided on a fresh start with apps and settings.\n\nI do think Samsung should have standardised on one processor for all markets, rather than Snapdragon for some regions and Exynos for others. Being in the UK I have the Exynos and have been concerned by some of the performance  comparisons. Having said that I do get about a day now out of it with moderate use but generally only charge it to 80% to put less stress on the battery.\n\nI love the S Pen and find it incredibly useful for scribbling down thoughts and ideas whilst out and about.\n\nThe display is really superb.\n\nAll in all a fantastic phone.",
            "This is a great phone but the fact that they use a completely different processor for US phones which is clearly superior isn't fair. The battery is also pretty horrendous coming from a note 10 plus. Camera is excellent and love the 120 hz.",
            "I love pretty much everything. Two gripies. \nWhy do I get so many Ads for Tic Toc when I have no intention of installing it and why no green light when the battery is at 100% and the phone switched off, as my old Note 9 had?\n\nI would say the online manual is skimpy, but I am used to the Note series, and I want to know more about integration with MS Office.\n\nI have yet to experience 5G but the phone seems fast, the camera really good (thought I still prefer a real camera with more optical zoom), there is masses of memory for storage",
            "I pre-ordered and got my new Note 20 Ultra 5G 2 days before general relase. SmartSwitch used to transfer my Note 10+ 5G to new phone. Boy, did it get hot (the Ultra 20). Disappointed, a dead spot on the screen that I could not use the S-Pen on.\nGot a replacement on 02/09/20. Eagerly anticipating my new Note 20 Ultra. SmartSwitch used again, still got very hot. Guess what, same dead spot on phone. So dissappointed, I have requested a return and refund. I have used the Note since the 7 (sad but it got recalled), Note 8, Note 9 and Note 10+ 5G. Never have I been so dissapointed. Had a Samsung Galaxy S, S4, S6 and S8 before going the Note route. Come on Samsung, this is very poor.",
            "Overall I'm really impressed with the phone compared to my note 10+ there is noticeable improvements even with one generation.\n\nThe only thing I'm a bit let down by is exynos processor which is vastly inferior to the snapdragon 865+ that our American counter parts get as the exynos processor runs hot and my battery life has been a bit sub par.\n\nOverall the screen is amazing and cameras fantastic I just wish we get the better processor next year!",
            "Always love Samsung. If you know gadgets, no need to look for other brand. Note 20 ultra does what it says. I wilk recommend it for someone who is busy at home, at work, at school",
            "This is a top of the range phone and you get \nwhat you pay for.\n so even though I love this phone.\n if you don't use or need all the high end features it has. \n samsung do have less expensive models \nBut I would give it 9 out of 10 and say go for it",
            "Too early to say do or don't but I'm happy for the moment!",
            "It's gorgeous, fast and smooth a a baby's b****m.! Expensive but worth every penny. A useful upgrade from my Note 10 plus. The buds are superb too.!",
            "Upgraded from the Note 10+ and am very impressed with the Note 20 Ultra 5G. Screen is amazingly good. The integration with Windows via Your Phone Companion app is a much improved experience with much more functionality. Still getting to know the camera but pictures taken so far have been impressive. New Spen and Samsung Notes app seems to have improved experience and seems to be even more intuitive. Battery Life as it has got to know my usage is very impressive. Oh and it makes and receives phone calls!!",
            "6 years ago I made the android jump and went for an S6 edge. Went to a Huawei and after that brief dalliance came back and have had the S phones ever since. Always wanted a Note so waited patiently and this is absolutely worth it. What's not to love? The screen is amazing. The phone is fast despite the Exynos (think only gamers will see a difference). Camera is amazing. Have not yet tested 5G but it is a nice to have for when the technology gets adopted. Loving the 256gb storage and as an avid galaxy tab owner for 4 generations the S-Pen is amazing! Did a presentation for an interview on my note (yes got the job) and the S-Pen made it a breeze without the need for a bigger device. The phone also looks nice and is a lot less bulky and heavy than I thought it would be and the glass on the screen feels really sturdy. With 3 years of android updates I see no need to upgrade for a very long time. I went for black as the other colours are too flashy and faddy for my taste so definitely future proof. If you're pondering, take the jump.",
            "The camera is good, some nice pictures taken so far",
            "The note 20 ultra has been great around apart from. App compatibility has been an issue, Some apps haven't functioned unless updated via galaxy store (e.g pokemon go) other apps state that there may be issues when running, other apps fail altogether. Hoping this due to the latest OS and these issues will be resolved.\n\nCamera is great in low light and the ultra wide camera is a game changer.\n\nSome missing features:\n3D scanning\nHeart rate and O2 sensor\n\nKeep up the great work.",
            "Excellent phone, very fast and smooth. Only issue is battery life, its abysmal!",
            "The Note 20 Ultra 5G is an really good phone.  The camera is amazing especially at night which really surprised me.  The only bad point I have found so far is the battery life as I am only able to get a little over 8 hours even after optimising it using device care. So to make it last all day I have had to buy a battery pack to make it last through the day, hence the 4 stars.",
            "Still getting used to this phone, but after coming from Note 10+ ( and 9,8, 4, 3 and 2 before it) I'm not convinced its better than the 10+. Having a few camera issues with focus (but not alone in this and would expect a software update to address it). Like the overall look and feel, not sure about S pen being the other side now! I think a few months breaking in will decide ultimately how good this handset is. Hopefully not the last Note handset ever.",
            "Super fast operation of all apps. Smooth scrolling and super sensitive touch screen. Stylus is the icing on the cake for practical use.",
            "It's still early days (only 1 week in) and though I am liking the Note20 Ultra it isn't as much of a jump from the Note10+ 5G that I upgraded from.\nMost significant improvement so far is the camera (which was great on the Note10 but is even better this time around).\nThe S-Pen move to the left continues to be a niggle as my muscle memory has me trying to find it on the right.\nI've signed up for the Xbox xCloud service as I received the Game Pack with my pre-order, but experience so far has been really poor. The few games I've tried have been so laggy that they are unplayable.\nStill, for everything I actually want to use the phone for it's really good. Just a slight evolution over the Note10+ 5G.",
            "It's fast and takes good photos. I'm a big fan of the Note series and couldn't be without the stylus, to which this version is more responsive. \n\nHowever, the photos on the Samsung website his the fact that the camera lenses stick out at the back, by at least a third of the width of the main body of the phone. This makes it considerably chunkier when it's in the Samsung LED case, which could have made use of the void at the back below the lenses for multiple card storage. Out of its case, the protruding lens block seems vulnerable, making you extra careful where and how you put it down when you're not using it.\n\nWithout the protruding lenses I would have given it 5/5, and I probably would have waited for the next version with a flush camera unit had I known about it.",
            "Didn't think anything of the camera hump in the reviews, if it improves the cameras all good. However and I have no idea how it happened, but I pulled the phone out of my pocket and upon inspection the camera lens is broken. The hump makes it very vulnerable. Samsung happy to charge me for the repairs.",
            "Phone is a super cool bronze design with a very premium feel(premium price to match) Software is buggy with certain apps which will prob be sorted soon by software development.Battery life so far is very poor if used just causuly!! My old note 9 and 10 lasted a lot longer.Average of 5.5 hrs usage before needing a charge.....think it is the 5g chip that is causing so much drain and hopeful that Samsung fix in a software update soon",
            "Not ground breaking improvements over last years Note 10 Plus but a definite improvement on all aspects. Smooth screen graphics with the new 120 hz refresh when needed and 9ms pen to screen action. I use Pro Wacom graphics tablets/screens so the Note 20 Ultras pen is perfect for my daily use. I've  had every Note since the beginning and have not found a better all round device even over the S20 I have for my business phones. The Note 20 Ultra is a true power house for every business aspect and so I no longer need to take a laptop to visit a client. Hopefully this range will go forbyears to come.",
            "Coming from Note 10 plus I expected Note 20 ultra to perform better in all departments. However where it offers better cameras and performance I am not getting even a full day of battery even with an average use. Otherwise design is outstanding screen is a delight.",
            "bigger screen is better and performance is better but dont feel much different between Note10 plus and Ultra yet",
            "What a phone. Speed is incredible.\nScreen crystal clear with super fast refresh times even at the highest settings.\nImprovements to connections help amongst devices. Pop up screen for buds when connecting is really useful.\nPen improvements were needed from note 10 and this delivers. now a remote control function right across the phone.\nLooks fabulous. The Bronze colouring is inspired.",
            "This is my 5th note now! Love it! Just gets better every year!",
            "There isn't much I can add that isn't already said by YouTube reviewers. It is a great device and I love using it, actually prefer weight and screen to Note 10+. The battery however is so poor, by 6pm in the evening I am thinking about where a charger is. That's not right in this day and age, paid a shed load of cash for a phone that doesn't last a day. Hoping Samsung can send an update to do something about this!",
            "Amazing Phone.... Would definitely recommend to anyone",
            "As usual another excellent Note. Better than the last one.",
            "I had a note 9 prior to this phone, and I dont find that much difference between them, yes applications load quicker, screen resolution is much better, I dont think the battery is as good, but this could be because the phone works much harder.  Not really got a handle on the camera yet, desperately want this to be better than the iPhone,  as my daughter will not accept that samsung is better than iPhone.  It was very easy to transfer old information,  very happy with that.  Size wise, it is a very big phone, close to being a tablet really, thicker than the note 9.  Overall I am pleased, but not sure yet it justified the extra cost.  It did go onto 5g once, and that was amazing speeds, very exciting.",
            "screen is excellent,battery need to be improved, camera features is fine, processor is fine though i can not understand why in europe we have exynos instead of snapdragon that america has",
            "not sure about the battery life ?. Struggle to get it to last the day, maybe it needs setting up, not sure.",
            "I am a big fan of Note series, and this year what a nice surprise. \nPre ordered phone and really happy with latest buds what came free. Both received Wednesday 2 days before official launch. \nPhone battery improved quite significantly to compare with previously owned Note 10 plus.\nI am not tech person...but definitely can see how smooth and quick phone works.\nCamera is totally different league and really pleased with it.\nGreat connection to TV to see own galery or other videos. \nSize of Note 20 Ultra is good and not too big as some reviews said. Just few milimetrs more.\nWorth the wait and price tag ...you getting what you paying for. \nAbsolutely in love with it.",
            "The phone is very good to use and easy the camera is very good quality and music is sounds great",
            "Features are cool stylus is easy to use, camera is awesome could be a little clearer on 50x zoom but have the s20 too",
            "Phone looks amazing and sounds great. However the 3g,4g or 5g is more like 0g. My previous samasungd performed significantly better than this, which begs the question on whether im going to keep it. After all I do hand another 5 days to make up my mind....",
            "Love the phone perfect size for me super quick also bought watch 3 and buds brilliant trio I am samsung through and through best phone yet only slight criticism is battery doesn't last me all day",
            "This phone is brill for photos and music with buds. Once you learn how to use it you won't do without.",
            "Am disappointed at the battery life of the new note 20 and also the refresh rate is choppy at best.",
            "All things are good except the poor battery drain and plus it heating a lot about 43°c which is disgusting at this price",
            "The screen is amazing, its comfortable to use and responds well to all touch inputs. Extremely usable, quick and efficient for everything i have used it for. The camera is amazing!... unfortunately the battery doesn't last quite as long as i would like it to but it will last for most of the day",
            "Phone would be great but battery drains after 4 to 5 hours. Considering returning it if it doesn't improve quickly.",
            "Great phone, battery is great, performance is great, looks are great.  Pokemon Go and Boom beach both don't work which is disappointing, and I'm still not sure why the UK doesn't get the good CPU - but, it hasn't stopped me loving the phone.",
            "This has all the feature samsung has to offer but there are some drawbacks, the exynos 990 chip isn't as efficient as the 865 plus and it really shows it terms of not being able to do quadHD AND 120hz aswell as battery life performance. Despite this massive drawback I truly love the feel of the phone and all the features including everything the S pen can do. The design of this phone is also phenomenal i personally went for white and I love the colour and the feel in the hand.",
            "This is my fourth note from Samsung ... and the series just keeps getting better and better...from the amazing screen, the sheer speed and power of the device, the amazing camera to the new and improved s-pen and notes features.  It makes using a mobile for work a joy - and that means creating things like powerpoint - the handwriting to text to powerpoint/word etc just works... amazing if you see my scrawls.  The low latency screen means the s-pen is even more of a pleasure to use.  As for that screen for watching videos  - wow!  The 120Hz screen is amazing.\n\nMy recommendation - if you haven't tried this phone... do it now - you wont be disappointed!!",
            "Had been using th Samsung phones since Galaxy S5 days. Note 20 ultra has been the rubbish phone. Samsung please wake up and stop giving us a phone with inferior chipset.",
            "This has to be the best phone I have ever had. Everything I expected and more. Easy to set up and easy to use. Still have not put it to its full potential yet. So much still to discover.",
            "S Pen is brilliant and Bixby could not be more of help",
            "great product only i will prefer flat screen instead and finger print comes could be in the back because if u use screen protector it is not accurate as without I will prefer it in the back as S9+ in the central of the phone never let me down in 3 years",
            "I have been a user of the \"Note\" since the Note 4 and find that although the overall functionality has been a simple evolutionary progression in palm top office PC capability. However, the change in the camera specifications from the Note 10 plus 5G to the Note 20 ultra 5G has been awesome, as is the display clarity and definition.",
            "Greatvphone, easy to use with great features. The screen is amazing plus the pen makes everything a breeze",
            "This is my first review, so apologies in advance for any errors.\n\nI decided to write this, as I am not happy with the my new phone and wanted to share it so others can have a better idea of what they are buying.\n\nStarting from the positives, cool features such as the wireless dex (connect to TV and see phone apps on TV in a \"desktop\" User Interface), nice 5x zoom, 8k video etc.\n\nLooking at the battery last 5 hours on the second day (no background cloud sync as I disabled that on the first day when I suspected it might be the issue) and every day really so not happy that I cannot have peace of mind of a single-day of battery life\n\nI tried Dex for a few minutes (scared to see my phone getting hot) and I was impressed with it, although not sure if there is any practical use for most of the users.\n\nCamera is impressive (night mode, 108MP pictures, video quality)\n\nOnly if the battery would last longer, I would increase performance and value ratings",
            "I am the old man I started with note one  I know samsung very well",
            "Brilliant phone had the s9.i thought that was good untill i had the ultra.best phone i have ever had.tryed other phones but samsung are in a class of rhere own.well pleased.",
            "Not found this to be a massive improvement on the Note 10+. The battery life isn't great, it's worse than the Note 10+ and the new features are limited. Felt like I had the same phone after 5 mins of playing with it.",
            "The phone is slow its glichy and the battery doesn't last i have had to turn off so many features just for the phone to last about a day seriously I would have preferred keeping my s10 plus absolutely not worth the money im paying for it and truly a piece of garbage phone",
            "Very slow not fast at all and battery dies very quik",
            "Samsung have done a great job with the Note 20 Ultra 5g. The updated S-pen is a fantastic feature and has next to no lag. The camera is amazing, the night mode allows clear photographs in very low-light levels. The only fault I can raise is the battery: smaller capacity than the S20 and it fails to see out the day. Because of this, I don't make use of the reverse wireless charging for accessories. Luckily I have three of the super-fast chargers and 30 minutes sees the battery capacity up in the region of 50%.",
            "The Note20 Ultra 5G feels like a step up from the Note10 Plus 5G. The S Pen feels a lot more natural, and the speed is fantastic. There's loads of features that just make every day easier like DeX being wireless and Live Caption. Link to Windows is also better than ever. Would recommend it to anyone.",
            "Love the camera features. Love the S pen, Love the speed of the phone. Great battery lifet, even on highest quality settings. Perfect phone for me to organise everything in one place.",
            "I upgraded to the Note 20 Ultra from the Note 10 plus. The Note 10 was a great phone but the Note 20 Ultra just seems to beat it in terms of speed and camera. The s-pen is also better this time round.",
            "Sleek ,powerful  ,easy to use ,loving it,great camera features. Lighter and larger screen feel,compared to last model",
            "My first ever Samsung. Really nice phone. Great camera. Easy to use.",
            "Beautiful design, feature rich mobile design that encompasses both the casual user as well as the power office user",
            "The phone is good, I don't feel a bit different from the Note 10 Plus, particularly to justify the increase in price.",
            "Phone is superb. Great Camera and features are amazing. Build quality is excellent.\nOnly let down is some apps do not work due to note 20 ultra coming out with a higher operating system than the apps. Also when reading internet pages phone freezers and page has to closed and reloaded.",
            "The display is amazing and applications load quickly!",
            "The screen is excellent as with most Samsung device and the camera is great. \nThe S pen is better than my previous Note 9.\nHowever battery life is worse than my 2 year old Note 9.\nThe in display fingerprint scanner is not as fast or as easy to use compared to having one on the back of the phone either.\nThe main speaker on the bottom of the handset has swapped sides which when using the phone tends to be right where my little finger sits to hold the phone, this doesn't seem like a problem until you try to watch videos.\nOverall the phone has better performance and a great screen but probably doesn't represent a huge upgrade in real usability over the Noteb9 I had previously.",
            "I have returned the phone as the battery drain was exceptional. My note 9 smaller battery last longer.\n\nI've used all tricks to prolong battery life but no joy.",
            "It's a great phone phone but so is the Note 10+ and this is not a noticeable upgrade.",
            "The screen is brilliant as always, the build quality feels solid. The camera seems excellent. I would have like to see a bigger battery, like 5000ma, even if it makes the phone a couple of mm bigger, and a 7.1\" screen. If like to see some more rugged cases from Samsung, their rugged case for the note 20 ultra doesn't really offer enough protection. And I don't see why we in the uk have to have the exynos processor..",
            "I love Samsung note.  I am using note phones from the last 10 years this is my 5th Note phone.",
            "Good phone with great features. but battery life does not last me the day and I do not heavily use it. Sometime it over heats. I am a bit disappointed with the processor as well, knowing that there is a better version of the phone out there makes me wanting to return it.",
            "Having pre-ordered the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra as an upgrade from the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G, I wasn't  expecting much to be honest. However I have been surprised so far the screen for one is enormous and bezels seem to be a thing of the past. There are other minor improvements such as the under screen finger print reader appears to be finer tuned. It is early days but certainly an improvement on last year's model thus far.",
            "I was so disappointed in this, the camera was so pixilated,  it wasn't worth the money , nor the wait for the release. \n\nI have actually went back to my S20 Ultra",
            "Battery is bad. Only lasts about 10 hours. Certain apps stay open and drain battery and u have to restart device. 108 mp camera is too vivid and doesn't look nice. All other modes are blurry and don't focus.",
            "Battery life is not good only problem with the phone",
            "upgrade from my note 9 and its a huge one.\nalso the galaxy watch 3 works really good",
            "Features are awesome as Note devices always are, totally a note fan since day 1!\nDefinitely appreciate the fact the phone is slimmer and now easier to hold in hand so Definitely a plus.. overall great phone so far, early days still..",
            "This is the worst batter life I have ever experienced on a phone it is really bad",
            "This is my 4th note now, always great features but I'm not impressed with the battery life at all and charging it twice a day.",
            "After upgrading from the Galaxy S8, I do feel that not much has changed, other than the obvious such as the removing of the bezels, the camera, which I have not tried much and the added feature of an Spen. \nWhen I received the phone, I was excited to test out the Spen since I had been looking into buying a note as my next phone for a while. After 24 hours with the phone I am enjoying the added features of the Spen. I have begun making notes and organizing my files within the notes app, testing the app called PenUp and sent a couple of live messages. It works very smoothly and for me personally I do not mind having it on the left as it is my first experience with an Spen.\nBatteries are something I have always had an issue with in the past, first on my S4 Mini and then my S8. Just days before my phone arrived I was watching reviews and finding that the battery was weak compared to other phones such as the S20 ultra. Now that it has arrived I am starting to notice that I will have to charge it as often as my S8, which was once a day and sometimes a small top up at night to make sure there was enough battery life for the next morning.\nFor the camera, which I have not tested much I found that it works well but as soon as you go past around 10X zoom it begins to get blurry. Even with a case which does extend past the large camera bump i'm still scared it will get damaged due to the amount that it sticks out of the phone.\nFinally, I feel as though certain apps such as Snap chat have become a little blurry on this screen, although this may be the pre-installed screen protector. In addition to this, I found that many of the wallpapers provided on Galaxy Themes also look blurry on the larger screen and it took me almost an hour to find a suitable wallpaper which did not look too blurry, draining my battery a lot. \nOverall, for me this phone performs very well, my experience with the Spen has been very good so far, however the battery could be improved for such a powerful phone.",
            "I pre-ordered the N20 ultra as soon as it was announced and was delighted when it arrived 2 days earlier than advertised!! I've had 24-hours with it now and have noticed many differences to my N10. The screen seems sharper, more colourful and maybe a little brighter? The phone feels slick and fast to use. Games run so much better. The S-Pen is absolutely brilliant this year. I had a go at dex on my smart TV, seemed to work fine. can't really say anything about the battery as it's still learning my usage pattern, seems about the same as my N10. I've noticed a massive improvement in notifications and using the phone as an actual 'phone' it seems like they've tied up all the loose ends from the previous model. Smart switch worked great, took about 25 minutes on my home Wi-Fi. All in all I really love it and to top it off it looks beautiful in hand as well. I have the mystic bronze, I've taken some pictures using my S6 tablet, they show the colour pretty much as it looks. Five stars from me, delighted with my purchase."
