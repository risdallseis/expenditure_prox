            "I saw a phone in the Daily Mail which was £70 plus, but my daughter persuaded me too buy this one for my husband who is hard of hearing and who knows nothing about technology. It was very difficult to get the Sim in, but after doing so, it isn't loud enough for my husband to hear even with hearing aids in. It just doesn't have the facilities that the 70 pound one did. Looks like I will have to buy !!!",
            "We had to return this mobile phone as it would not accept his old sim card even after we bought a sim card adapter.",
            "Absolutely waste of money the battery gets red hot on charging it can not use it",
            "Brought this as a present, on opening the package no battery. Can not take it back as store closed due to covid.",
            "Simple not perfect but does the job",
            "Bought for elderly father in law abs perfect fur him. He got the hang of it quickly and buttons are nice and big",
            "A nice looking phone with a large screen and large clear buttons, but utterly dreadful to use, it's not user friendly or intuitive, there's very little choice of ring tones or message tones, picture quality is poor, the instruction booklet is confusing with very small print, definitely a phone to avoid",
            "I bought this phone for my mum because of the bigger buttons as it was ideal for her  took it out the box on Christmas day and the battery won't even charge will be returning it once lockdown is over",
            "Great phone for someone who just wants an easy to see and use mobile  for calls and texts ..perfect for our elderly mom ..its had so much use already , she's loving it and is on it constantly   lol ...handy emergency call button on back too ..was simple to swop in sim and set up ..the docking charging unit that came with it is super handy to just drop phone into instead of messing with a fiddly lead ..long battery life  ...

            "You don’t have to be IT savvy to set this phone up. Quite simple really. The phone takes a standard SIM card so if you are going to use an existing SIM card from a previous phone which is a nano or micro sim, all you need to do is buy a SIM card adapter kit. They are only a couple of quid. \nThis phone is a great size. Clear screen and large buttons. \nIt also  comes with its own docking system for charging.",
            "Bought it because I wanted large buttons to make texting easier. took a while to understand where SIM went but got there in the end. It's a great phone for those who want a basic job like me. Easy to operate.",
            "This Alba phone has a screen large enough to see who I dial or what I text, The big buttons and big numbers are easy to see and ideal for someone with thick fingers, The width of the phone makes it easy for me to grip, And the simplicity of its operation is ideal for some one of advanced years like myself.",
            "Third of this model, a good phone. However had to replace twice in two years as the phone will no longer charge.",
            "I bought this for my Mum who spent some time in hospital. She can't work out how to make calls but can answer - so that is a great bonus. Some of the instructions take time to work out but it didn't take time to set it up. The big buttons are great for her arthritic fingers.",

            "Bought this as a replacement phone for my father who is in his 80's and completely baffled by technology. Just popped his original full sized sim card in and he was good to go!\nEasy to set up and even easier for my father to use once I had set up the speed dials.\nThe SOS button on the back is a great feature but thankfully has only been tested and not used for real!",

            "The bigger buttons are great, the SOS button can to easily be operated by accident.  The display is good, it would be better if the ring could be louder for those with poor hearing.   The instructions that come with it are to a very poor standard and setting up is awkward and time consuming. A cheap device purchased as a lifeline type device.   If purchasing for someone elderly I suggest you set it up for them first. With some thought and design revisit this could be so much better.",

            "The phone was perfect for the purpose it was bought solved a big problem",
            "Perfect for my requirements, simple phone, call and text that's all I want. Unfortunately no calculator which might have been handy and SMS 'write options' always seems to reset back to simple abc (rather than predict, which I select) after each sent message. No major problems, SIM hard to insert - worried I'd break it! For those like me who hate touchscreens this is great! Overall I'd still give 5 stars.",
            "Cheap phone very basic ideal for a spare phone and worth the money delivery service was great and fast",
            "only downfall is the battery life \ncould be longer. but it is easy touse",

            "Good mobile however only 2 ringtone choices and Bluetooth connection to car needs to manually connect each time.",
            "If you want a phone that is easy to text and call from then this is good. \n\nIt takes the older SIM cards, which is important if you want to keep your number and not have to have a sim swap.\n\nYou need more memory for photos which can be added.\n\nUseful emergency call button on back.",
            "Marvellous just what the doctor ordered",

            "Bought it for elderly family member no complaints",
            "I bought it for someone with poor eyesight and she seems to be able to make calls on it most of the time. The main fault I found with it is this: You're supposed to be able to program it so that it doesn't start in LOCKED mode. That didn't work for me, so unlocking it each time added an unnecessary complication to making a call.",
            "Bought for an elderly relative. I can't accurately review this product because the first one we had didn't even turn on despite being charged using the charger that came with it. The replacement turned on and charged OK but the battery only lasted 30 minutes before turning off. Also the charger was so fierce that the phone got so hot that it melted the Sim card.

            "Perfect size and sturdy phone , my dad who’s in his 80’s can use it yes problem . The charging cradle is a great idea as he was always loosing the charger to his previous phone . My only slight criticism is the instructions and the sim holder are not very clear",
            "For the person  who wants a phone mainly to make and receive calls  This phone is very easy to use      sits snuggle into the hand   the bigger  keypad buttons  reduce the risk of mis dialing      a built in touch  makes this a great  little phone  Allan",

            "I bought this product for a relative in hospital. I liked that I can buy from Argos at a local grocery shop like Sainsburys. They were also open late. The service was good because I could walk in a quickly buy the product I needed.\n\nThe phone is great as it has big buttons which are useful for the elderly. The large green and red button also makes it clear those are to call or cancel calls. It was great it came with a charging dock.",

            "iThe phone was for the mother in law she loves it",
            "Bought for my Mum as she was struggling with her tiny phone. \nThe charging cradle is a really nice touch for someone with poor mobility.\nConsidering it's plainly marketed at the senior market, this doesn't quite cut it in the accessibility stakes. Nice big screen but the background image is useless for someone with poor eyesight. No easy way to switch it to plain background without putting in a memory card, or just make the screen black and white.",
            "Bought for my father who just wants a simple phone to use for calls and occasional txt. Just what he needed and took his old style sim card",

This phone has a clear screen, quite large keypad buttons and is easy to use. The charging dock is a good idea as her fingers don’t allow her to fiddle with a small charging point in the base of the phone.  She is taking a little time getting used to pressing 2 buttons to unlock to make a call , but, is getting used to it.",

It wouldn't suit anyone who has used the more modern phones as you are going backwards with this phone. Still, it is OK for a spare phone, or could be OK for the elderly or those not wanting to keep up with modern technology. There are better, cheaper, more modern looking, cheaper phones for sale.",

It is generally easy to use although adding contacts is a bit fiddly as it takes about 5 or 6 selection clicks but selecting a contact is just 2 clicks which was much appreciated by the owner. About the only criticism is the off button - it is too easy for an elderly person to hold the off button for 3 seconds and inadvertently turn the phone off, after which it won't accept calls .",

Having dual sims is like having two phones - you can keep the two sims separate. The big buttons are very responsive there's less risk of wrongly  dialled numbers.  The camera is a bit basic but does the job, and like everything else about this phone it is easy to set up. Over all a good basic phone.\n\nPayment from home was fairly easy and service at the counter was excellent as always.",

The problems I experienced with this mobile was inserting the battery, it takes the standard (large) sized sim card and I didn't understand how to insert the card and information online was not easy either.
