            "Aznu is a new way of buying that premium branded phone you always wanted, but at a much more pocket-friendly price. With Aznu, you get a refurbished phone with the same camera, features and processor, plus a brand-new screen and a 12-month warranty. You also have the knowledge that buying Aznu helps reduce landfill and waste. We include a Sim tool so it's easy to pop your old card in, a year's worth of Norton 360 VPN Virus and Spam protection, and a cable and charger so it's ready to go! If it looks like new, it must be Aznu. "

            "Happy with phone purchase Delivered fast too",
            "I love my AZNU Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. I found it easy to set up and use which surprised me as I was expecting the process to be difficult for me to understand. \nI buy a lot of things from Argos and know that the item is going to be exactly as described and if there is anything wrong they will deal with it quickly."
