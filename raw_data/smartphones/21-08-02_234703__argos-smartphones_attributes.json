            "nice button phone for a elderly person,  bought it for my father in law,",
            "Who could design a phone which allows the ringtone volume to decrease to zero whilst in your pocket, even when the keypad is locked? And who could be irresponsible enough to pass it as fit for sale? Nokia used to be well respected - what went wrong? I bitterly regret choosing this model. Not fit for purpose.",
            "I bought it mostly for the basic features, I use it as an alarm, radio and media player. I tested it with a sim and is good overall but the internet does not do too much. There is Facebook installed, but unfortunately you cannot add Messenger. I find it better to use it for these features than have just a media player. It can also be a good back up phone for emergencies.",
            "I purchased it a month ago",
            "Great value and easy to use. Reliable and simple. What more could you ask?",
            "Bought this for my 85 year old mother\nGreat features and easy to use, even for an older lady",
            "Fair enough feature phone. Features include mp3 player, radio, vga (0.3mp) camera to take pic's and record video. There is \"internet access\" which is reminiscent to the Nokia mobile's of the earl/mid 2000's, so don't expect smartphone internet connections. All round if you want a simple feature phone to text, send pictures & make calls then this is a good phone.",
            "Purchased this phone on the same day I visited store and got a great service from the colleagues in Argos Bath Road Slough",
            "I bought this as an emergency phone when when was in for repair. Advertised as unlocked, I would assume it would be fairly universal, however if was not compatible with my network. \nStandard issue SIM cards are generally 3G, this phone only takes a 2G SIM so it was useless to me.",
            "Bought for an older person who does not do smart phones. The buttons are easy to press and the display is a good size. This is a replacement for another, older but similar style nokia and the only annoying part is the sim card size. It's gone back to the larger sim size meaning I also had to purchase another sim card just for the outer carriage to make the sim fit. This would have been useful to know at the time of purchase.",
            "Not happy that I bought this. Ringer volume is easily turned down unintentional whilst keypad is locked.  Otherwise it would have been perfect for my requirement...",
            "I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and its a decent little phone for the price. Battery life is good its lasted me nearly a week when fully charged. Would recommend  as a good back up phone for anyone looking for one while there's is getting fixed or waiting for an upgrade.",
            "Bought for someone in their 70’s who didn’t need anything to complicated. Great for anyone wanting a simple phone to make and receive calls",

Android phone battery doesn't last above 1-1.5days  Not found any problems. Camera not high resolution but didn't buy it for that.. Took a bit of time getting used to telephone type keyboard again!",

Battery life, brilliant - charged it as soon as I bought it - lasted 10 days easily, before I recharged when it registered half-full to full. Though to be fair, I barely used it except as a timepiece.\nThe slight annoyance is I accidentally press the volume up and down external side pieces when in my pocket - and have learnt to hold it from the base of the phone.\nGreat value for money with a very long battery life.",

            "From the moment I got it out of the box I hated it but Argos don’t refund on tech products. Its more bulky than I’m used to. I keep pressing the side buttons during a call which is annoying. I’m used to inbox and sent boxes but this one seems to group all messages to one person - even if they were on a different subject. The colours grey and orange aren’t exactly my faves but that’s what you get for text messages. Without any sd card you have only really awful ringtones to choose from.",

            "I bought this for my 82yr old husband, he loves the look & finds it easy to use (still learning) he likes how he can higher the volume (a problem with most other fones) since he is hard of hearing. It is dual sim but works well with only 1, also bought him a memory card so he can take photos to his heart content without having to delete because of storage space",
            "Great product , I bought it for my elderly mum as she like button phones and it's easy to use good value she can hear well on it and likes it she can also hear it clearly when it's in her pocket or handbag so yes I would highly recommend if people don't like modern touch screen phones",

If you have some degree of hearing loss or work in a very noisy environment it is great. Radio is good too. It has some of the features found on a smart-phone but is no smart phone! Battery life good and very cheap to use on 02; 3p minute calls and 2p a text. When you press menu it automatically brings up messaging with contacts above. If you don't like complicated technology - great.",

It does have many things that I will never use but if you like games, internet, weather, camera, Facebook, radio, etc, it's all there. Smart phone it isn't. It's basic and designed to be. A very neat phone which will suit older people or people like me with some hearing loss. It is loud. You will hear it. Great little dual speaker radio, again, LOUD. Love it!",

It's just archaic!  the dual sim is fantastic but thats about it.  back to a smartphone I go, but with no facebook.",

            "Is a very good phone and you can carry easier on you",
            "Couldn't get a signal at all so returned it the next day for a refund.",
            "Good fort he use intended stands up well",
            "I thought it was too good to be true. I assumed I put my sim in and go. I thought I'd be able to use it straightaway, but it wasn't as straightforward as Nokia made it out to be.",
            "Bought this for my 65 year old mom.\nShe’s chuffed with this mobile phone as the battery lasts longer and she’s getting perfect reception all round the house and outside even better. Money well spent! I totally recommend this phone.",
            "My husband’s new phone. He just wants to call and text without too much charging. Does the job at a reasonable price. Build quality looks robust.",
            "Having decided to overcome the distraction of a smartphone this phone was exactly what I was looking for: a device that simply allows me to call and text. The keypad has a good feel to it making it swift to type SMS messages. The screen size is just right and I love the bumper controls at the side. The contemporary design betrays the low price. And I can't say I miss having to charge a phone up every night. One charge lasts me over a week. One very happy customer!",
            "I bought this for my partner and this is his first mobile so needed it to be easy to use. This fits the bill perfectly and he has taken to it like a duck to water. He wanted a phone that would fit in his pocket and this was a good choice.",
            "nice little phone easy to use and set up becarful that you don't click though as I ended up buying a game I didn't want was only looking",
            "Excellent value for money. Allows me to keep the old Mini-Sim going.",
            "For the price the phone is totally worth it. For someone who is behind the times and loves a good classic nokia. This is the phone for you \n\n\nPerfect battery. Easy navigation \n\nEven has a torch. Like comom you cant get any better for the price \n\nLove this phone ❤",
            "simple and easy to use but still stylish and has all features including camera",
            "A good value easy to use phone that i purchased for my technophobe husband.",
            "5 star from very good price and service",
            "I have had to change network but o.k. now",
            "Build quality seems good. Plastic through out but seems durable. This phone runs on the more basic S30+ OS. This means it can do a host of things in a limited way. It is a 2G signal so no good for Three Mobile customers. Calls are loud and clear. \nThe main reason I give it 4 stars is because it is aimed at music playing. If you put a lot of music on to a SD card you have to scroll through the albums to reach what you may require. You can not create playlist, only a favourite list.",
            "Great mobile - easy to use. Has internet access, camera etc - all that one would expect with much more expensive mobiles. This one is fantastic value for money with all the perks.  So glad I purchased it.\nLori N",
            "Not wanting a phone often so this is perfect does all I want.",
            "This was a perfect replacement for my Dad's phone, the battery life is fab and its easy to use.",
            "Great phone for the money. Does the job a treat and the Argos delivery service was 10 out of 10 - delivered to my door in a couple of hours! If you need a simple phone to make calls and send the odd SMS then this is the one to go for.",
            "Bought for our mum as a replacement for her old Nokia phone after her previous 15 year old phone required another new battery! \nA great lightweight compact phone, perfect for the use of an “in an emergency“ phone.\nAnnoying that we can’t get rid of the dual SIM function when we only want to use 1 SIM. Using with an o2 SIM card.",
            "Good price and I like the new design I would recommend this phone to any original Nokia fans lol am looking to get the red and white one",
            "I bought it as a present for my niece",
            "Too easy to accidentally alter volume due to exterior toggle button,which cannot be locked.Keep missing calls due to low sound volume,new Nokia phones are not as good as the originals.Prior to this one we had a 3310 which packed up after 15 months won't buy any more.",
            "Am not one for a smart phone and had my old Nokia for many many years.  This is a much needed update and has new icons so it is easier to see what you need. Battery life is good. Also has the capacity to take photos but I haven't sourced the memory card yet.",
            "Great phone, Nokia at its best",
            "Rather flimsy construction.",
            "Great little perfect phone. Very basic just what my Nan needed!",
            "very good phone! long life batery I am very happy!",
            "The slightly larger design of the nokia phone allows me to see the screen much clearly in comparison to my older Nokia phone. I love the elongated design as it looks so pleasing to the eyes. The phone itself is practical to use, and allows me to take a break from my daily usage of a smart phone. The simplicity of the design makes the phone practical and user friendly. You can even listen to the radio without a headphone, but the sound quality is better with a headphone on.",
            "Magic just perfect love the mobile",
            "I bought this phone as a second phone used only for calls and text messages, nothing else. The main reason is because the battery life. When your buying a new phone you have to charge the battery for 12 hours when charging the battery for the first time. With the Nokia phone I had to wait another week for the battery to discharge. I don't know how long the battery is going to last, I've charge it 10 days ago and I still have more than 75% and between 30 to 60 min of calls already. Very happy.",
            "I originally bought this phone as a backup incase my smartphone breaks. Definitely takes me back to the mid 2000's. Great for nostalgia purposes. It's got a nice bright display and fits well in any pocket.",
            "Light weight and easy to use for a novice to electric shavers. Bought for my husband in hospital to make it easier to shave after brain surgery which had impaired his coordination skills. He was able to use it fairly well. He was happy with it.",
            "This is a smart easy to set up phone with a long battery and storage options. Good as a spare",
            "Phone is easy to use and has very clear symbols. Camera is good quality too.",
            "It's a simple phone you can't hear too loudly or clearly"
