But as a Nokia would be at least double the price, I'm really pleased overall.",

            "We bought this phone has a replacement for my Dad as my son decided phones could fly through windows (hint, they really can't!). It is a great basic phone.

When you wanted to use it to make a call or text it was often on emergency calls only, and then you had to switch on and off again for it to find your network.. Waste of time and money having to return it.",
            "Using just to call and send message. Works perfectly! If you need to use a sim card just to call, this is the right product!",

Perfect for anyone who only texts or calls. Battery life is ace!",

Contacted Argos customer service who tried a couple of things but said they thought it was a network problem. I got onto the network who also tried a couple of things ending in a new SIM being sent out. This still didn't work. In total 4 different networks were tried in this handset, none of which worked. So I returned the handset for full refund.",

            "This is (at the time of writing) the cheapest phone Argos sell. ideal if, like me, you lose your phone and need a standby until your new phone arrives.  the phone works fine, no features worth having but makes calls and text messages.  Dual sim is also useful, meaning I could keep the emergency PAYG sim alongside my replacement for a week or so (in case anyone called me back on my temporary number)The only disappointment was battery life which was not quite as good as I expected",

The police were very nice about it, but it must now be a problem for them. I felt so embarrassed!\n\nArgos were fine and gave a refund.\n\n\nI RECOMMEND ARGOS.

Although my biggest issue is that the phone dialled emergency services about 6 times in 2 days! I had to apologise to Essex police twice! which is a pretty awful design fault obviously..\n\nfully charged it lasts about 4 days which is the only redeeming quality this phone holds, sadly not enough though, don't buy this phone.",

Also because its basic and not full of apps its a quick phone which is good for business people who also can hold two Sim cards which is handy for a business number and a personal number. I was also happy with the fast service and the politeness of staff at Argos that day.",

You can upload photos and set them as wallpaper, and upload music files and set them as a ringtone, just a bit of personalisation that makes it nice to use. It's a shame it doesn't have a decent camera.",

            "Small and handy, but size might not suit an elderly person or someone with poor eyesight. Few ring tones and not a phone you would buy to surf the internet so if you are expecting smart phone quality and features then look elsewhere. SIM free with dual sim slots and a micro memory SIM card slot is useful although the camera isn't that good. Sound quality during calls is adequate and the loudness of the ringtones is plenty sufficient. Charge time quick and it holds charge for days with minor use.",

            "I bought this as a stand in while my smartphone was being repaired. It did what I needed it to: call and text, and for a cheap price. The lack of predictive text makes texting a chore - a problem Nokia solved 15 years ago! Anyway, for the price, I can't complain. This phone will live in a draw as an emergency phone and for festivals where I wouldn't like to take my smartphone and the long battery life is a boon.",

It's easy to download personal stuff using Bluetooth but the instructions are basic, still can't find out what the blue graphics are next to the signal strength.

The screen colours are very / too bright making the menu difficult to read at times.  Also, the search item restricts the view of the contact, can't seem to alter or get rid of this.  Maybe the sim free Nokia might be better for a couple of pounds more but there again this one is cheap.",

So I purchased a sim for a pay as you go on a 2G network, only to find we don't have reception. So if the blurb says not 3G compatible, it also means 4G also and has nothing to do with Three (the network).",

            "At less than £15 you cant expect too much for what they rather unfairly call a 'dumb' phone. I got this (sim-free) to replace the one I bought a couple of years ago (for £9).\nObviously this is only for someone that wants to make & receive phonecalls - not browse the net etc (it can do this apparently but I'll use something else for that).\nYou get a useful torch function & the usual host features.\nIt locks itself well enough that you'll never accidentally make phone calls from your pocket.",

            "Recommended",
            "For the price, this phone is great! Dual sim card reader as well! You will do well to keep it as a second phone in the car or use when abroad (with country sim) to reduce charges.

            "Have had a couple of basic phones and when last one went wrong I got this one. Still very basic but does have a few extra features, without the complication of being a smartphone. Only real criticisms are that it doesn't have predictive text, so have to write absolutely everything out; and if you take a photo you can't send it to anyone in a text. Think you can using Bluetooth, but haven't figured that out yet.",
            "It does what it says on the box and no more than that.\nNot enough memory to add more ring tones and/or pictures for the screen without adding a memory card.\nThe phone works for me as all I need it for is basic use.",
            "I bought this phone for a youngster and was disappointed,\none ringtone, and it would not receive text messages, so\nreturned it to store, for something different, maybe I was just unlucky as others like it.",
            "Features ok for such an inexpensive product.",
            "Purchased this as the spare 'family phone' for when we do not want to use our better phones. Son had previously had the Alba 2.8 phone. Have to say that this one surpasses that model as it has many features packed into a lightweight and very compact handset. Battery life is excellent, obviously it depends on the amount of use made of the various features. Prefer this model to two of the very basic models by a particularly well known brand as the finish is better.",
            "This is a basic phone but we found it difficult to us as it has no predictivetext",
            "All I wanted was simple texting and phone calls.\nIt does these perfectly well. It allowed me to turn off references to a second Sim. The memory is small and battery does not seem to last long, but I am happy with performance given the low price.\nInstructions were rather lacking, but you don't really need instructions for an intuitive phone.\nI had to prise the back off to insert the Sim. It is not clear from the instructions whether the back should actually slide off.",
            "It is worth the price and has a good battery life."
