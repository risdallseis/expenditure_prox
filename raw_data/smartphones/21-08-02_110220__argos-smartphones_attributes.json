            "Gone back to Samsung after switching from another brand.\nReally pleased with this phone, great camera and excellent screen.\nReally can't find anything bad to say about and I don't think I will ever switch from Samsung again .",
            "Never had as many technical issues with one phone. Bought this few months back. Fingerprint recognition doesn't work properly and often doesn't recognise mine. When making purchases and I select a saved card no details are saved apart from the expiry date. The phone overheats a lot. Sometimes it switches off itself even when the battery isn't low. It's just rubbish and not worth the price you pay!!",
            "iPhone 12 pro 512GB there’s like a new very good condition",
            "Battery is good. Finger print scanner poor face recognition poor in comparison to the S9. Also no heart monitor feature which I liked. No headphones or adapter to use any headphones. Feels plastic. No notification led which I found useful. No feed back from the home button. Camera I thought was supposed to be amazing doesn't seen that impressive. Screen is good. But from an upgrade perspective a new battery in my old S9 and it would have been a much better phone than the S20 FE 5G",
            "Wow what  fantastic phone , super quality and very fast unlike my old s6. Very happy with this mobile but how can i send back my old phone as i dont want to lose my discount i recieved.",
            "It's easy to operate.  Clear speakers.  Takes Fantastic pictures.",
            "The phone is great. Setting it up was done in no time as it was so easy. I love using it as I can do most things on it rather than using my laptop or tablet.",
            "Great new phone, lovely size and display. The camera quality is amazing; I upgraded from my 4-year-old Galaxy S7 Edge and the difference is unbelievable. Great storage and memory also - hope to have this phone for a long time.\nOnly reason I haven't given 5 stars is that occasionally the screen seems to need recalibration or something; I'll type in my passcode and it will miss out a number, or I'll be using an app and it won't keep up with my finger as I swipe across screen.",
            "So my old Samsung S10 plus had seen better days. The battery was not holding its charge like it did before.\nI wanted an S21 ultra but although I'm sure that is a fantastic phone, it's also a very expensive phone (at time of reviewing) \nI also take hundreds of photos so wanted a phone I could use an sd card in.\nAfter loads of watching YouTube videos I made my choice and chose the Samsung S20 FE 5g \nThe phone is so good. Battery is amazing. Screen is so b smooth with 120hz refresh rate.",
            "I tend to be a launch screen clutterbug and so the superior screen display makes for a very easy app search on the fly. It was built for Android 11's new features.",
            "Is very fast, great battery, great camera, I only think that samsung has to optimize a little bit his software but the rest 10/10",
            "Stutters when switching app - Not smooth at 120hz.",
            "Great camera, nice authentication features. But has had a couple of bugs already. They seemed to resolve themselves.",
            "Great phone with a Great camera and a lot of very good function, big screen good size ok to handle",
            "Had for just over a month after coming back from huwaui better screen and faster so really happy with it so far. Great battery life as well",
            "Performance is off-the-charts BAD. I used to game a bit with the kids, on this phone, forget it. Lagging so bad on fortnite it's unplayable. Closing every other app, clearing memory etc. Makes no difference. \n\nMy old Oneplus 6 with its ghosting, cracked screen, is better.",
            "Well device if very fast . Got about fiew weeks . Battery life is great. Best mobile for this price",
            "Won't run vikings war of clans on mobile data. WiFi is fine. Not EE issue as game runs on data on old phone. \nShame really as this reflects on my scoring of the S20fe 5g.",
            "Love this phone! It's fast, cameras fantastic, screen size is great. Was nervous about getting another android,  it had been over 4 years since I had a new phone , shocking I know! my old Samsung was sooo slow, was actually thinking of getting an iPhone! And I've always been Samsung all the way! The silly prices of iPhones put me off! My son matched me up with this phone and I swear no iPhone could be better and the best thing is its so much cheaper! So happy I stuck with Samsung. \nSo the bad points.  I was expecting the battery to last a little longer, doesn't charge as fast either. Still getting the hang of the gallery, photos just don't go where I want them. Having two Google accounts doesn't help. \nStill would recommend 100%",
            "Great camera and easy to use phone. Fantastic features",
            "Feel,easy to handle. Does what it says.\nAs good if not better than an iPhone.",
            "I like the phone but the battery doesn't last very long",
            "Easy to use Samsung phone with great sound and excellent screen for video and pictures.",
            "love my new s20 fe 5g,look amazing and simple to get around,game play is so good",
            "Same set up to the Galaxy S9 really, similar interfaces etc. I've always had Galaxy phones so was an obvious choice to get an S20. One massive change is that this is 5G ready. \nIt also has a big downside, the processor seems A LOT slower than the old S9. Constantly needs apps killing or the phone freezes up and you can't even open apps... wish I had realised this within the first 14 days of getting it! I would have definitely sent it back and gone for another model....",
            "I have come back to Samsung as there so easy to use great features \nTakes the a good photo good big clear screen",
            "Great pictures and fabulous images which transfer simply",
            "It's a great phone but battery life is poor and compared to p20 mate Pro which has better battery life",
            "I had it bought the s20 fe  for xmas. I thing its wonderful phone. The only bad thing is when you to press the space bar you can press the full stop button. I bought the sim only one and ran it on ee for quite a few month the changed to sky. Work good.",
            "I like the new range of colours and I enjoy the different functions and features of the software on the phone. It's as though Samsung thought of everything that can make a large candidate screen phone easier to use. It has a really good battery whether I use it on battery saving mode or 5g. The battery on average lasts a full day on 5g and a day and a half on battery care mode... and I am a frequent music streamer and film streamer. \n\nIt has really good speed whereas the 4g is concerned, soo much so I don't really use the 5g unless I'm in a really network deprived area. They offer loads of help and support within the phone to get you started as well, plus it only took less than a day to synchronise all my personal media. It is now become a replacement for my everyday phone. \n\nIf you're worried about breaking the phone there are more than enough cases already available to prevent that problem, be it a fashionable case or rugged case. I particularly like the fact that Samsung has made phones to suit all budgets with a variety of features. So if you didn't want a 5g version, they have made sure they have the 4g version available as well.",
            "new features great camera quick processor knocks spots off my s9",
            "The camera is excellent, perfectly clear and bigger screen is great. Just love the whole fone",
            "The Samsung S20 Fan Edition is a decent enough phone with a lot of the best applications on and available to it.\n But what let's it down same as the IPhone that there is no headphones jack and you have to buy the adapter or Bluetooth headphones separately.\n Also there is no notification light so you cannot tell if having to run silent if you've received a message or not.\n Otherwise good Samsung phone.",
            "I like the camera the features the performance and the overall look",
            "Love it very nice not to big not to heavy just right",
            "Superb device, with amazing camera, and operating speed. Size is perfect, with great build quality. This is my 3rd Samsung, and will never go back to any other make.",
            "Camera and ease of operation is fabulous \nScreen scratches far too easily so needs a screen saver",
            "So, pixel has gone in screen so have permanent red line. Still 2 months awaiting my repair. Battery doesn't last which is disappointing",
            "Love the colour and is light and easy to use  as always have Samsung phones",
            "Since buying my new phone I am now certain that I had made no mistake everything I expected I received from the great camera to the smoothness of movement on screen and the ease to manage most things from my phone definitely a great product",
            "It's got a lot of great things such as the camera that takes really good pictures and the sound quality for listening to music or the graphics which are great for watching video or playing games ... the only downsides I have found is that the battery life isn't as good as I personally would like wouldn't last the day if playing games on it. And then there is no earphone socket so Bluetooth earphones is a must if you haven't got an adapter",
            "Amazing phone with great features.\nI definitely recommend Samsung s20 FE to all my family and friends",
            "Only had a few months and nothing but problems with it",
            "Best phone I have purchased. Love the video quality and the camera quality.",
            "I had.enough of.using iPhone so I was think I try now Samsung and absolutely love it. Easy to use a lot of tips from Samsung, camera perfect! I love the style and the colour available to chooose!! Please have a go with Samsung20 FE 5G",
            "The cameras are out of focus straight out the box, no smudging, the settings are crazy, the auto rotate is overly sensitive, the finger print scanner requires all saved finger prints to be the same finger and still doesn't work.\nThe adaptive lighting does not work, the editing software for photos isn't exciting like previous galaxy models\nIt keeps disconnecting from WiFi\n\nThe microphone is pretty decent and the super slow mo and Pro video is pretty decent if it wasn't for the bad camera quality, I think the settings on the Pro camera are great although I still use my s9 for taking photos as its reliable\n\nNo music player or gallery built in, no head phone port and chat heads from Facebook are not a thing with this phone and other silly things like this are built into the design",
            "A good phone, Samsung makes upgrading easy by allowing contacts, apps, messages, etc  transferred with ease and minimal fuss",
            "Upgrade from s7 edge which apart from battery life i was happy.\n\nCons with s20 fe \nFingerprint is sketchy. Never works.\nBuds are taking some getting used to.\n\nPros\n\nCamera bit better\nSeems quicker\nBattery lasts at least a day",
            "The camera on the phone is exceptional. The phone is fast and doesn't slow down when I have several things going on at once, when I play games the phone doesn't over heat like previous Samsung phones have high I've owned. Very simple to use even for someone who's never had a Samsung. I've had top of the range Samsungs for the past 10 years and I would say this model is one of the best I've had if not the best.",
            "Overall good phone, good camera and battery. Screen as described. Cloud orange colour nice. Biggest issue is volume on calls. Very quiet and have been unable to resolve the issue",
            "U absolutely love my S20 FE,  it's super smooth with the 120Hz refresh rate and the amount of customisation and features is truly amazing and love making my phone truly mine and Bixby is also good with my only negative being only 6GB RAM rather than 8GB and its a testament to how good the S20 FE is that only having 6GB RAM is the only thing that's not perfect.  Amazing phone overall and which I'd tried Samsung sooner as One UI is fantastic.",
            "Brilliant and easy to use would definitely recommend it to friends and family",
            "Love the fechers and the quick apps the phone is brill",
            "No competition s20 is the best phone I've had, done a Great job with the display, the sleek and stylish finish everything is a win",
            "Poor tbf. Feels cheap. Camera isn't great. S10+ is better.",
            "Amazing all rounder phone with a great price and great hardware. Also the 120hz display is butter smooth",
            "I love the processing speed and the capacity on the Samsung s20 FE.  It's as close to the most perfect device as I could imagine.  Definitely recommended.",
            "I love the easy of use.\nStill discovering new things all the time.\nMy favourite thing just now is the side panels.",
            "The smart switch from old to new phone was incredibly easy to use.  The phone features and functionality are clear crisp and the slightly larger screen makes things easier to read.  I have experience no issues with performance and the phone have withstood being dropped a couple of times (in a case) with no damage",
            "I decided to go for this phone because I had read plenty of reviews and I got a brilliant tariff deal and a free Samsung watch so all round awesome deal.\n\nThe phone was so easy to use straight out of the box, had a nice big screen and even came with a screen protector provided. It powered up so quick and was easy to transfer my data from my old Samsung phone. Once powered up it was easy to use and navigate and apps were so quick to load up and use and had more features then my s10.\n\nThe best feature and upgrade for me is the cameras :-) there amazing such clear clarity and lots more features I was so impressed using the cameras as I love taking photos of scenery and creating my own art so this photo didn't disappoint.\n\nI would definitely recommend this phone to friends and family and already have. I am so glad I chose this phone very happy customer",
            "It ticks all the right boxes. One of the best phones for the£",
            "Absolutely love this phone moved from iphone on my last upgrade to this phone was a bit worried about doing this but am so happy I did I love it .",
            "Used to love my Samsung S9, thought the S20 would be a lot better, of course is a lot faster, more memory etc etc, in my personal opinion, I do find it a little bit too big, specially if you try using it one handed, trying to unlock it with finger print is absolutely rubbish!!! I'm disliking it so much that I would send this phone back if I could, face recognition also doesn't always recognise your face so lot of times I end up unlocking the device using my password.\nScreen is nice, great picture, but overall I would not recommend this phone. \nExtremely disappointed!",
            "Great phone great features! Yet I think regarding the screens touch and feel and smoothness compared to the S8 & S9 has taken a step backwards still a great phone as always.",
            "Just love all the features this phone has. Best phone I've ever had",
            "Best phone I have had.\nLove the camera.\nAnd big sc",
            "Fast, easy to use. Comfortable to hold. Great features",
            "I had the s8+ a d that was good but this phone is 10x better words do not do it justice.",
            "Really pleased with ny new phone. Took a while to get used to the sound coming from top and bottom but make playing tunes without earphones much better.",
            "Good phone. 2 in 1 makes life easy. I bought it with 1 heart and it surprised me.",
            "Perfect for me have no downs about it runs fast battery life better then what I thought it would be",
            "Great photos Appearance speed quality of workmanship displays",

            "Good**********************************************",
            "It's a really good phone, the quality of the craftsmanship is amazing and it's simple for me to understand and use. The display is also very good",
            "I just think it is a lot better than the s9 I had 100%;",
            "This phone does everything its more expensive competitors do and better....Great looks ....long battery life....and 5G connectivity....what more do you need",
            "But sometimes the fingerprint access does not work",
            "Great phone works well fast and responsive just one issue that's the battery would prefer something that lasts a little longer yes it's got fast charge but the battery does drop quick but will last a day",
            "Camera with 30 x zoom really impressive and the flat screen",
            "Fast and reliable, great screen picture quality and sound",
            "I do really like this phone I think best features are cameras phone speed and the easiness of using my phone",
            "A massive upgrade from my sony Xperia xz3! Well built, good storage and decent camera",
            "My only issue is that transferring data from old phone was very complicated and didn't come with the cable transfer connection which was in the previous phones still trying to get hold of the information from my passwords",
            "Generally everything you could ask for!! Get  one now!",
            "It's easy to use bit quick for an old fart like me but I'm getting their",
            "I upgraded from an s8 to the s20 fe 5g. Great battery life, but not a lot else has wowed me to be honest, it's a larger, faster version of the s8. The selfie camera is a big letdown for me unfortunately, it is grainy, warps the photos after taking to make face appear wider, and has zero manual focus or zoom. Big, big letdown for a fan edition in my opinion",
            "Got the S20 FE to replace my old S8 and it's a massive leap forward. It's slightly bigger than my old phone and us so much more responsive. Love being able to use my voice to take a selfie feature. Batteries is also a lot better, I can get through a whole day on without charging, I have Spotify on all day virtually and watch videos during my lunch break, video calls and make normal calls all on one charge, great. Highly recommended this phone, great value at this price.",
            "Not a bad phone but only had it two months and the dreaded moisture detection warning comes on even though its never been near any water",
            "I switched back from Huawei and I gotta be honest... the Huawei was far superior. Battery isn't as good, slower at charging and no headphones supplied. For a newer phone I've felt I've taken a step back!",
            "Touch screen is very temperamental. Some areas of the screen won't work, and other areas are overally sensitive. Can also be very slow too. Overall nightmare to use at the moment, only started doing this the other day but otherwise a good mobile",
            "In love with the camera and speed of the phone. Its a great device",
            "I LOVE my phone, so easy to use!! Wouldn't have any other make now!",
            "The Phone took a while to set up . Once I had  Loaded  My apps, Set My Ringtones  & Other bits. The only other item I had to bye was  a USB - C  to 3 5 mm Phono Plug & the phone is the Best Phone  I have Ever Had.",
            "Awesome phone I've had at least 10 Samsung phones but this is the best yet I've used for my work phone.",
            "The phone is realy good and i like the audio and high quality screen",
            "Always loved Samsung, and they keep getting better and better. Amazing camera the clarity is fantastic. I'm still finding new things on my phone that increases the performance and fun of the phone. I'm not tech savvy so can't comment on that side of things, but if you want excellent performance, quality and a phone that is up there with the best, then this is the phone for you.",
            "So, I've owned a few Galaxy phones over the years (S2, S4, S6, two S8's and now the S20 FE) so the title 'fan edition' suits me pretty well. It's been good to experience how the Galaxy S range has evolved over time, with noticeable advances in technology and innovation for the better. The first thing that impressed me with the S20 FE is the screen. It's simply a joy to view things on, whether it's video, pictures or simple checking your emails, the screen is just so sharp and responsive, and it's probably the best I've seen on a phone. The sound too is very impressive, with the extra speaker at the top to give the sound the extra kick it needs to be heard. But the thing that drew me to it was the design, with the the mix of metal chasis and 'glastic' back in a good selection of colours, it made its self stand out amongst the ever growing number of generic looking  phones. all in all this is a great phone to have with impressive specs and a killer design.",
            "Decent phone, does what a phone should do. Alright camera, good speed. 5g is fast when I'm in a 5g area.",
            "Great screen, smooth scrolling, lots of updates. Sd card. Losing the 3.5mm not such a big deal now I have a USBC dongle.",
            "Its a good phone and worth the value especially with 5G and the processor, but it has some software issues like HDR10+ Video being laggy with video stabilisation enabled",
            "Loving all the features and quality of the functions",
            "Build quality and feel is great, but the speed and smoothness in which the Samsung Galaxy S10 FE 5G operates is sublime. A worthy purchase.",
            "A decade long iPhone user, switching to Samsung was scary. I had so many questions but within the first 3 days I've grown to love my new S20FE. The camera function is the best I've seen for a long time.  The battery life is astounding. This phone beats any iPhone anytime. Works well with wireless charger too. I wish I could have added all my itunes music to my Samsung. Also wish I could add more ringtones or personal tunes on my device.",
            "Phones been great so far but after the last software update when I open the camera the phone crashes then reboots the phone very annoying",
            "Really good phone for good price!! Good camera to everyday Photos.",
            "Was really looking forward to this phone but after two months have found it to be very overpriced for the most mid range of performances. The camera quality is dreadful, the range and tone of images is terrible, low lighting is iffy at best and incredibly noisy with low detail, zoom is subpar and pales in comparison to my three year old Huawei. I switched to gcam and tried the Adobe camera too for slightly better processing but the hardware just seems a bit naff and overpriced... Ideal if you're just gonna overlay filters and view pics on a tiny screen tho. After a month of regular use and keeping memory / storage in check, the phone has started being sluggish, recently crashing and having to restart when switching between browser, Spotify and Snapchat. It also runs super hot. The cheap shell   chipped at the back in about three days with normal indoor use. And, just a personal preference, but the Samsung software is a tad in the side and very bloated, I've popped on a lightweight launcher but still can't rid of them shoving Samsung features in my face at every opportunity which clashes with Google and negative impacts ux. I'm genuinely disappointed in this phone, it was marketed as an all rounder but for the price I'd really suggest going for something else.",
            "Overall I like the phone however it's not perfect. I have Exynos 4g version, and overall it's a good phone, but the battery life is pretty bad, and I think I may sell it because of it. I get about 3-4 hours SoT which for a 4500 ma battery seems odd. \nI had an S10 lite before this, and with the Snapdragon processor and 8gb of ram it was quicker than this phone, and the battery life was much better. \nThis does have some improvements such as the camera set up, and wireless charging. If the camera was better on the S10 lite I would probably go back to that though",
            "I love samsung galaxy phones a samsung galaxy for 20 years so will you send me a samsung active watch out for free thanks Michael barke",
            "Bought my phone 2 weeks ago and a few things I've noticed is that it overheats too much and for too long. Can freeze when using an app, has a great camera. I don't even have many apps but the phone freeezes and laggs ALOT, even now I'm typing this, it's lagging. Not sure if I'd recommend it as overheating and the lagging this early is a big problem for me. If I could get a refund or an exchange, I would in all honesty as this shouldn't be happening with newer phones. My Samsung S9 didn't have these issues 2 years in.",
            "Great phone although a few teething problems with notifications not showing and problems with the email software. Also a but disappointed I got a notification re getting a free Samsung watch which I then was not entitled to.",
            "Feels familiar not to sure about no headphone jack. Fast Reliable good battery life. Rime willntell about durability but it will have to fo sime to be better than my old S9.",
            "Great camera, I've been taking a lot of new photos and even started a business by selling said photos, nice screen for when I'm at work and playing games or watching movies but it's let down by a terrible battery life, my former phone (huawei p30 lite) used to get through most of the day before needing a charge, now I'm charging twice or thrice a day.",
            "Very bad performance. Phone gets really hot with a minutes when i start a game also while using multiple screen it's stop working and get hot which i never experienced in my s10e or s8plus.",
            "Everything is brilliant on the phone, and better still..\nMy only gripe is my charging cable is already faulty. I need to set the phone in a certain position to keep the charge,and only the original cable will fast charge the phone. Quite annoying. Other than that, I love this phone.",
            "The phone is very slow when typing and also tapes multiple letters when iv only pushed it once",
            "Love it, works really well, great colour, screen is bright",
            "Great Amoled screen with 120hz refresh rate for a super smooth experience. Good battery despite this and 5g modem. Slightly smaller than I would have liked at 6.5\" but great for those who dont like big phones. Only issue is the lock screen which doesn't apply the blue light filter but this could be updated with a software patch.",
            "Great phone, easy to use with loads of brilliant features",
            "I think the phones really good for the price and looks amazing but I'm not a fan of the fact that I get an exynos chip instead of the snapdragon which does prevent me from doing certain things I was hoping to do",

            "This is a great phone. My S7 was the best phone I've had and was reluctant to change but had no choice as the battery got to a stage where it wasn't charging (have had it years to be fair). Not disappointed, this phone offers everything you could want. Other reviews have covered everything this does. I only came on to rate this as the only disappointment is the change to USB-C headphone jack from the standard 3.5mm. Wouldn't be so bad but the S20FE model doesn't come with headphones. Bit 'cheapskate' on Samsung's side I think, they could have included earphones. First phone I've received that didn't have earphones in the box. Would have given 5 stars had it included these.",
            "Very disappointed compared to my last phone,doubt I'll have another!",

            "I love everything about my new phone system I dnt leaves it no were",
            "So, I have had my Samsung S20 FE (Fan Edition, Yay!) for about a month and feel I can now share some of my thoughts on it though I would point out that my experiences so far have been that this is a brilliant phone (saves you having to read the rest). I have the 256Gb version in Cloud Mint colour and bought a transparent Tech21 case to protect it. Looks really great, feels good in hand and the case allows me to see the fantastic colour of the phone. In fact, I like all the colours in this range based on what I have seen on the net.\n\nThe 256Gb storage is overkill especially as I also added a 128Gb SD card from my old phone. Imagine, 384Gb of offline storage, I guess I should start getting used to cloud services. My previous phone was a 32Gb S7 (before that an S4, S2 and S1) and I spent ages trying to create space by deleting apps and moving them back onto the SD card, for some reason they never wanted to stay there. With all this space I can now reload all my old favourite apps and games again such as Where's my Water, Temple Run, Asphalt and even some news sites that were simply too big for my old phone. I have installed loads of apps recently and only used 50Gb, so the 128Gb version am sure would be fine for most users. \n\nAs you can tell I have the DS (Dual Sim) version which means I can have two sims (one for this country and one for abroad if needed) or as I have done I used the second sim slot to hold my 128Gb micro sim card. The phone is really fast, the car racing Game Asphalt plays superbly and casting the phone to my TV (via Firestick) was easy and with spectacular results.\n\nI had a lot of indecision whether to get this phone or a pricier, premium version like the S20, S20+, S20 Ultra as each has certain extras (or wait for the S21 FE etc.). I ruled out needing a 108Mp camera, why would I need that. Ultimately the bigger FE battery helped me choose and I easily get a day out of it even though I leave the 120Hz refresh on. Talking of the screen, it's superb whether at 60 or 120Hz. The colours are bright, the blacks are deep and it has a super glossy (premium) look to it. I wouldn’t bother with any more resolution, just overkill.\n\nMy old S7 Edge had a curved screen. I don't miss it so don't be put off that the FE is flat, unless that's what you want. Once it’s in its case the shape of the screen is less obvious anyway. I don't need to pay premium prices for that. BTW, the phone arrives with a screen protector and the display size which originally I thought might be too big is just right though I do have larger hands than most. Trust me you will enjoy this display.\n\nAnother key factor for me was price and avoiding paying a premium. Although the back is plastic it  looks and feels premium to me. Don't let having glass all-round hold you back as you will be more than satisfied esp. once nestled in its case. \n\nSo the camera is another area where compromise has happened but again, I think the camera is superb. I like to point and shoot and expect a good quality image to appear...it does! There are even three zoom buttons from wide to narrow that are easily accessible on the main camera screen. In fact there is a heap of functionality that I haven’t even begun to dig into in the camera.\n\nWhile I think of it:\n•\tCharging: real quick with the supplied USB-C lead and adaptor. Buy yourself a nice new powerful wireless charger and a set of ear buds (I use ENACFIRE E60s) as this phone doesn’t have an audio jack socket. Worried me for a few seconds not having a jack but my earbuds are superb and comfortable lying in bed with my head on the pillow and I barely notice them\n•\tI had to buy some more leads as I only had the classic micro USB connector (for my S7 and previous phones) where the latest Android phones now use USB-C\n•\tSound out is fine\n•\tThe finger print scanner works a treat, absolutely no issues when I use it. Got both my thumbs scanned easily\n•\tThe only downside with this phone and indeed any Samsung past the S10 is that my Gear VR won’t work with it so have had to hang on to my S7 just for that (not trading in).\n\nSo all in all after lots of research I am incredibly happy with my Samsung S20 FE 256Gb SM-G781B/DS, I cannot say there are any downsides of significance.. If you are looking for a great phone with all the major functionality then you cannot go wrong with this one, why pay more!",
            "I love the size and feel of the phone and its camera is amazing. The fingerprint scan on the front of the phone is brilliant.",
            "I love this my new phones SAMSUNG S20 FE excellent",

            "I am really disappointed,  I have had Samsung phones for as long as I can remember. I have this phone on contract.\n\nThe on off button that ultimately controls everything has snapped inside and has come out.\n\nMy service provider has informed me that under the Samsung warranty this is my fault. I fail to see how a button has snapped inside the phone and I have damaged it?!\n\nI have always recommended Samsung phones and until this device have never had an issue.\n\nIt is safe to say I will not be recommending Samsung again nor will I be buying another of its phones.",
            "This phone is do easy to use, all the apps are great, very good smooth screen movement.",
            "Fantastic phone. Easy to use ,nice size screen ,plenty storage but most of all absolutely amazing camera.",

            "I hold of from upgrading from my S8+ and was very happy with my new phone. Then some things started to niggle me. The loss of the health monitoring features was the first (no heart rate or oxygenation checks). Then came the hit and miss fingerprint checking. The phone I still love though, with its extended battery life over the S8+, glorious screen and much higher performance.",
            "Was worried about how hot it got a first but seems ok",
            "Where to begin well the last Samsung smartphone i owned was an S7 Edge it was certainly a quality handset but wow how technology advances.\n\nThis Samsung S20FE (Red) is without a shadow of a doubt the best smartphone i have ever had the pleasure to use and own. \n\nIt's fast and snappy the screen quality is incredible but the hardware is nothing without software to match and Samsung have done an excellent job there too.\n\nI'll sign off by saying i will be certainly remaining with Samsung for now and in the m future i highly recommend my device and no am not an employee of the company lol.",
            "I'm a recent convert from a fruit based product and I'm never going back. The phone is so stylish and the features and specs are amazing.  Plus if I have any issues they are customer services are so friendly and helpful",
            "It's great when paired with a Samsung watch, there's so many features and settings to choose from. I love all the fitness and health information it gives you and the watch encourages you to move periodically through the day.\nThe phone itself is comfortable to hold and easy to use. There's a nice variety of settings to choose from to personalise the handset.\nUnfortunately, with heavy use, the battery does drop quite quickly and  I find myself having to top up the charge during the day. Comparatively, I had a Huawei prior to this and with the same amount if use, I still had around 30% left at the end of the day.\nThe camera is good, with some good editing features to create different effects.\nThe only other issue I've had is that I've had to reset the handset a couple of times when the touch screen seemingly loses its sensitivity and I struggle to get it respond to anything I'm trying to do. I find this a little annoying when the phone is only a month old and I've had to do this 3 times already. I've never had this problem with previous Samsung or Huawei handsets.",
            "I can't really fault this phone, I love that the edge display has gone in the front but I would prefer it didn't curve round the back as it would make the grip easier. I would of liked it come in different sizes as I have small hands I would prefer a smaller one such as the S10. \nI love all the features it comes with and the camera is amazing. Battery life is perfect. \nThe only reason I went with the 5G version was becasue it has the snapdragon rather then the exynos which is ridiculously rubbish. I know that you have lost a few customer because of this. \nDo not get rid of the expandable storage which you did the S21 line and for that reason when I upgrade I will go back to apple.",
            "Had apple for last 6 years . Never gonna buy apple again , Samsung just blows them out of the water",

            "Ordered on EE... absolutely love it, especially the colour (Cloud Lavender) it looks even better with a clear case on. The camera quality is amazing and the phone is super easy to use.

            "I had an S9plus before. I changed it for the S20 5g but I'm not impressed. There is very little difference between devices. Sadly no headphone jack, I've bought a connector separately, this could have been included! Facebook messenger does not have the icon appear for quick access. Battery life is better but it's a new phone.",
            "Just love my phone. Huge Galaxy fan and the FE is just amazing.",

            "This is good phone. Not flagship but still brilliant. Brought this for Snapdragon chip here in UK. Camera is ok. Battery lasts a whole day which is great. Wireless screenshots is great. Super fast charging juices up phone in no time but you will need to buy extra power adapter for it. Normal fast charging available. Memory card support is an added bonus. No word ear phone jack. All via USB c.\nGames run really well on Snapdragon.\nOverall tremendous value for money.\nThe only negative is that adaptive brightness does not adjust and is stuck at most times.\nDefenitely will hold value for 2021 at least.",

I choose the red one.",
            "Would recommend the 5g varient of this phone, it's that little bit faster and comes in handy for watching videos and going on the Internet frequently. Capacity is really good although it is unfortunate that it does not come with a SD card reader. Coming from a iPhone X, I've noticed focusing on this camera is a great improvement, with a large 30x zoom and contrasts photos brilliantly. It's an excellent camera with a incredible battery life.",

            "I upgraded my S9 to the S20 FE 5G. I'm not tech savy so it's hard for me to report anything interesting. It's quick, sleek and the battery is brilliant. \n\nThe fingerprint sensor is terrible. I've tried various strategies to make it as reliable as possible but with little success. The fingerprint sensor also means that the phone does not go into low light or greyscale at night, which counteracts the benefits of having settings to make your phone less intrusive after dark.",

            "I purchased this phone back in October and have since experienced so many faults. The thumb sensor is so intermittent it rarely works. The screen brightness goes up and down like a heart beating, like a strobe light constantly. Videos jumping and glitching.

            "I love this phone so much, I wasn't sure I was going to like it due to the fact I recently had an iPhone but I really am glad I swapped. The features are amazing and the camera is to die for. I'm so glad I brought this phone!!",
            "The phones amazing but it would off been nice to get an adapter or some kind off headphones that can plug into the phone as there's no headphone jack",
            "Great phone, has amazing camera quality and is really easy to navigate around.",
            "Like the camera an features of the s20 as well as the ease of operation",
            "Would have made a lot more sense if it had a headset.",
            "This phone does everything I require and more. Waiting for watch active to arrive so can test out this as well",
            "One thing I can not stand about this phone is how easy the glass gets scratched. Its only ever been in my pocket.. I had a galaxy s9 before this one and used it in the same way for 2 years with no scratches. I've had this phone for a week and already several scratches on the screen.. I'm really annoyed about it and want to send it back.",
            "It's got some great features for a non flagship phone including a great camera, much better than I expected",
            "Upgraded to the s20fe and love it, great phone all round and very easy to use",
            "Great phone fast and does everything I need it to do. Love the colour (orange) definitely would recommend",
            "Considering it's meant to be a \"fan edition\" I can't seem what fan chose these features. Previously had an S9 and that is probably my favourite phone I've had out of the galaxy range. Loads of features missing that would have made this better e.g. notification light, have the volume keys kept on the left, encrypt phone so you need a passcode/pattern as soon as you turn the phone on to protect it, have default ringtone for WhatsApp, have Samsung chat, have earphone jack, provide earphone adapter in the box, have the heart rate/stress sensor, back cameras should be in the middle of the phone.",
            "Can honestly say I was so worried about switching from my iPhone but will never go back there again, so much more I can do with my s20fe in love with all its features and ease of use 5 stars",
            "Phone is slow starting, freezes and I have to restart phone when I play football manager as the touchscreen doesn't work properly.",
            "Good..............................................",
            "For the price of this phone what you can do with it is amazing. I have always had samsung phone and before this i had a Note 9 and loved it. I was going to move to the Note20 but saw this and felt this was just as good for the price and it has! Camera quality is impeccable and the speed of this phone is amazing. Would highly recommend this phone!",
            "The phone is brilliant. Quick. Good camera. The only issue I have is only getting 50% of notifications when using mobile data. This was an issue late on with my S9 also.",
            "Good phone the speed is quick and the camera quality is great. Only major difference which takes getting used to is that all buttons are on the right hand side",
            "It's OK. Can't really see that much of a difference to the s10+ bit annoying no headphone jac have to buy type c adaptor.",
            "Lovely phone easy to use nice and fast bit disappointed  that then I got the phone you have to wait  over a month to get the gift that come  with it wen u get the phone u should  get the gift at the same time part from that the phone is brilliant",
            "Responsive beautiful  , easy to use and very nice to look at",
            "Great battery life, screen looks good, connecting to other devices is a breeze.  Poor signal compared to other phones I have owned,  this seems to be a problem with other s20 FE owners. Also the 6GB of RAM can sometimes struggle.",
            "Been waiting for the snapdragon in the UK for years now and finally get my hands onit with the s20 fe 5g and it is every thing I tought it would  be and more  plus the 120htz is silly fast really smooth, battery last me nearly 2 days on dark mode amazing, feel and look is lovly and my old phone was a s10 I don't think the glastic is a step down at all camera is also quality quick and clear all I need really. \nIn simple terms the galaxy s20 fe 5g is the way forward and my main reason is the snapdragon processor you can't get it in UK otherwise thanks samsung I love it .",
            "The new features the graphics is fantastic thanku very much",
            "Excellent, really good value for money, great product.",
            "I'm enjoying phone so far but I've already ran into an issue on the 4th day of usage. As my battery went, I turned on my phone when it was charged and my security pin wasn't working, I was adamant that it was the right pin, I had no choice but to factory reset my phone. I am now unable to set up a security feature to unlock my device.",
            "When I ring out ,sound is \"tinny\" \nVolume,even on speaker, is not very good .Went into Settings, clicked on age 60 + , also on audio for hearing aids - made No diff .at all to volume. Can you help me please ? I am 82 , but dont have a hearing problem",
            "So easy to use very clear to see words,nice big screen",
            "My first samsung phone, never considered it before but fancied a change. The camera is the best one I've ever seen on a phone. The screen resolution is impeccable and it works really well as an all round phone.",
            "It so easy to use and is a very smartphone I like the neat desktop",
            "I love the ease that I have in using the various apps and switching between them.Also downloading documents then switching to PC.",
            "Very good mobile phone Very fast really good. Its the best mobile phone I have.",
            "Cracking camera, beautiful features just love it... love samsung",
            "Device itself looks great, it was easy to transfer data from my old android,  but I am worried about the battery. I have it power saving mode already and without really using my phone it hasn't 9% in 2 hours. \nMy old phone was a Huawei,  and the battery lasted for days, I am using this phone for the exact same things and I don't think it will last more than 30hrs , in power saving mode, with only light use.",
            "Loved this phone when I got it but the sim stopped working in similar had to move the sim card to slot sim2 apps just disappear for no reason, reception can be poor on odd days . Sorry for me not the best choice I've made wish I had waited for the s21 .",
            "Upgraded from my galaxy s9 plus. And i will not be using this phone. It is much slower to do anything than my s9 and at poi ts really struggles to even open apps at all. Really poor performance. Screen looks nice i suppose.",
            "Its a good phone... its got a lotbof great features, however I've always loved LG and have to say this isn't nearly as user friendly as an LG phone.  My previous phone was an LG G6 and even though it was old, it still holds its own against a lot of the new phones around now. I just didn't have the option or like any of the LG's out when I got this phone. There are definitely some glitches with it and its just not user friendly compared to my previous phone. It's a great phone overall and the battery is amazing but I do miss my LG",
            "I got this phone as my contract ended. I previously had the Huawei mate 20 pro and I honestly think that the Samsung s20 FE is actually a downgrade. The battery life is worse, the camera quality isn't as good, no IR remote control, doesn't come with headphones or fast charging charger, even when using a fast charger it charges slowly and is the phone itself is sometimes slow. The in screen finger print sensor is the only thing better on the Samsung. Huawei are well ahead of the game and I think that I will go back to my old phone that was released 2 years earlier!! If the mate 40 pro had Google, I would have never bothered with Samsung again",
            "So smooth and crisp, only drawback is the plastic back but I knew that when I bought it, fantastic phone, 5 star",
            "The screen is great and the camera is so much better than my old Samsung j4",
            "I've had this phone a for around 6months now, it is a very good solid phone, however, there are 2 things I struggle with. 1) the camera. I simply cannot understand why this camera is near incapable of taking a crisp photo in this day and age! I have tried every setting and followed every guide online. The camera is simply always blurry in some aspect of a photo. 2) the battery! I am now getting (just) a days battery life after turning off the 120hz display capabilities. What a shame the handset is advertising these special features at the cost of one and other! As a result of these 2 important features being limited at best, I am now upgrading once more. To be fair, this is a good phone, if the camera issue does not bother you, it will be a good buy. For me, it's just not good enough and I wish I had stayed with my S10 which in my opinion is far superior.\nLastly a note in the 'Touch screen issue' yes, it was noticeable at first, but with the last update rolled out, I believe this is now resolved, from my perspective anyway.",
            "Really love the phone, the earbuds and my watch. However my android auto doesn't seem to be working in my car. Thats the only reason I give it  4 stars and not 5",
            "What a waste of money. Absolutely no improvement on the earlier models",
            "I love everything about my new phone camera colour prfamance",
            "Had my new phone now for a week, upgraded from the S9+ and can't fault it in any way, glad I got it.",
            "For the last 6 years I have used iPhone but since the s20 series came out I made the move. I do not regret it one bit it toke me just a few minutes to navigate the phone its so simple compared to the iPhone. Also it has an amazing display looks great.",
            "Love the device and looking forward to getting my watch x",
            "Great phone great camera easy to use stunning looks amazing all round",
            "Phone is superb but no headphones came in the box, highly disappointed. Wish I had read the entire specifications & details throughly.",
            "Great design Great features easy to use Great camera",
            "Brill phone would recomend easy to use nice and big",

            "It heats up too quickly and lags way to much.i would not recommend this phone for sure :(",
            "this is an amzing phone it is so eady to navigate and find what you are looking for",
            "I drop my phone alot so the FE being durable is great it fast and I'll keep it until I can't use it",
            "Lovely phone so slim and easy to use. Good quality pictures and sound is amazing can hear both sides of the phone.",

            "Love the phone. Does everything I need it to.\nFast load ups \nEasy to use \nBig screen \nGood camera",
            "Firstly switching everything across from my old s9 was easy as anything. Everything is set up and after a couple of log ins (passwords etc transfered too) I was off.\nThe screen already has a protector on it! The orange colour is lovely and the screen is super responsive!\n\nOver the moon with my S20 Fe 5G",
            "Got brand new phone. Only used for one month and already got charging problem. After leaving for 2hours to charge only getting 20%. Bought wireless charger to solve this issue but same result.",
            "The phone is overheating while you're doing anything, it doesn't matter if it's Instagram, your Camera or just watching youtube. Not to talk about gaming. Over 49°C on Battery and 79°C on CPU. Battery drain, around 10% in 13 min. I don't know if it's about the Exynos or Snapdragon version or about a bad optimization of the new Android 11 system but please, fix the issue!",
            "Best s series yet absolutely amazing keep it up guys",
            "Smart sleek designe features and great performance.  \nGreat sound quality and easy to use and live with. \nPictures from its camera are crisp and with the inbuilt features are easy to enhance and adapt.",
            "This was an upgrade from a Galaxy S6 that lasted me 5 years and boy was it worth it! The student offer was too good to miss out on.\n256GB is more than enough for someone who survived with 32GB for the past 5 years.\nSetup was super quick and easy with Smart Switch. It even transferred my wallpaper!\nHaving a 120hz screen refresh rate is insane and possibly my favourite thing about the phone is how quick and smooth it is. \nThe cameras are great. Except for 30x zoom which is pretty much useless. Selfie camera is pretty sharp.\nEverything seems really well integrated with some great new features like screen recording and link to Windows. There was a little bit of bloatware but not as much as previous Samsung phones.\nI opted for the Snapdragon chip 5G version as I hadn't heard great things about the Exynos chip and everything seems to be working as it should. Except for PS Remote Play, which never seems to link easily. This was a problem with my S6 too.\nThe battery life is more than enough for a day's worth of fairly heavy use at times with 120hz screen.\nNo phone heating issues either other than when first booted up, when it got a little warm but that's to be expected.\nThe screen obviously isnt as bright compared to other flagships since this is the FE edition but it's good enough for me.\nThe only downside was that the phone arrived in a damaged parcel box and did appear to have some marks on the screen but that may have been from the pre applied screen protector? Since the security seal on the box was still intact and the phone runs fine, I don't believe the phone was tampered with but maybe Samsung should look at quality control and definitely change delivery partners as DPD are an awful company.\nDo miss the headphone jack though and it seems only the official Samsung type C to 3.5mm wire works as I did try a OnePlus wire but it didn't work.\nAlso as a woman with small hands, I did wonder whether the phone would be too big or heavy for me. It's big there's no denying. But not as heavy as my brother's OnePlus 7 Pro. I think maybe the smaller size and lighter weight of the S20 would have been better but I can live with the FE phone's size and weight. Ultimately, the Snapdragon chip was more important to me than size and weight.",
            "All the features..camera quality music videos....and love the screen size.",
            "Had the phone one day, and somehow it won't receive any mobile data, having a new phone issued as we speak, I think its just one in a million that mine has stopped working but other than that best phone I've had.",
            "Great phone only downside is the no earphones but that doesn't matter the phone is amazing",
            "Having had notes since they arrived I was hesitant and sceptical about changing phones from a note. However I did and I am not looking back! I love my phone,  it has great features, the perfect size and the camera is great. I don't have the stylus I'm used too but I'm also not missing it!",
            "I'm very happy with my FE ,being an upgrade from an S7 its in my opinion a much improved model much faster and very responsive that said my only reservation is the camera ,I'm liking the new zoom out feature and the ability to switch cameras in video mode but when you zoom in the picture becomes blurred. \nOther than that I'm very happy with my new phone .",
            "Great phone for the price and the watch a brilliant extra!!! The camera is excellent even in low light .Struggling to get a phone cover though .",
            "Love the phone, its light, the camera is amazing! Cannot wait to explore this phone more",
            "I love the cameras and the finger print feature on it. It is good upgrade from my s9.\nThe back of the phone is made of plastic which is disappointing as the s9 was all metal and looked brilliant.\nThe phone is fast and easy to get used to. You need to get Bluetooth earphones as there is no port for them. \nGreat phone",
            "Overall perfect phone, for what I use it for it has everything you need I would say the battery does deplete quickly though and given that it's 2021 and phones advance like no tomorrow I feel this is a big let down. As for the price it's just right you get a lot of phone for reasonable money",
            "Great fantastic I've just changed from iPhone 12,,",
            "Absolutely brilliant phone, very happy with it! Brilliant charging time and battery! Love the set up of the phone!",
            "Love everything about the phone couldn't recommend it highly enough",
            "Great phone, good battery life great screen and not you large. Samsung's UI is a bit confusing in places but generally ok. Would have like the screen to be made out a higher grade of gorilla glass but the high end processor more than makes up for this at the price",
            "I have had the s20  fe now for about a week and there is only one negative and that's the network operator . Which says allot",
            "Taking it out of the box and comparing the device against my old Huawei p20 I can say it is a solid improvement. Bigger screen, well utilised space and everything is running super smooth at the minute. Would highly recommend for those looking for a fantastic device at a reasonable price.",
            "Smart looking and easy to use ,large screen means everything is easy to see",
            "I am loving the phone. The display, cameras and the performance on the phone is amazing. Sometime I feel like s20 fe 5g is a better phone than s20+.",
            "Coming from S8 plus, I found the significant difference in speed and camera quality. Haven't tried the 5G in our area as not yet available but i will surely benefit in the future. A good phone made for selfie-lovers!",
            "I love the storage i have for apps npw bit dont know how tp get 5 G to work or what to do with 2 sims that were sent with phone. Oh and cant seem to find any invoice of purchase to send along to claim free watch ?",
            "perfect phone for 2021, couldn't ask for anything more useful",
            "I also own a galaxy fold 5g that i love but since the s20 arrived ive been finding myself putting the foldable to one side ... that 120hz screen is addictiveely tanatalising",
            "I'm enjoying it a lot is a great powerful smartphone, but I just wish Samsung had kept the 6.7\" screen that I have on my S10 lite & if they would have shipped the S20fe with the same 25 watts charger like on my S10 lite, instead of the less powerful 15 watts charger, and also kept it to 8gb RAM lite on the S10 lite then it would been a greater 5 stars smartphone, sadly my friend is buying my S10 lite & I'm going to have to make do with the less slower 15 watts charger,  hopefully next time Samsung will listen to its loyal customers opinions & won't take things away from the new smartphones that's cost over £100 more expensive,  other than that I  don't have any other issues with the S20fe is a good smartphone.",
            "Phone great but come with no headphones my son wasn't happy. Sound quality is crap compared to my s10plus and my daughter iphone 7",
            "Speedy fast, smooth screen, amazing cameras.....this phone has it all for a reasonable price. I highly recommend this handset",
            "Yeah its a really good phone great for constant gaming and social media music and youtube",
            "Really like the phone, excellent camera, buttons are well placed. It has some very useful features. One issue, by now the WiFi should automatically switch between preferred networks when one is stronger. This should just be standard, not a poor third party app.",
            "Excellent have found everything to be first class , highly recommended this phone.",
            "I love the phone come back to Samsung after having an huwawi. Battery doesn't last long that is the only downfall",

            "I've owned a lot of Samsung over the years and I am so glad I carried on with it. I thought I would try the FE model out as it's cheaper with some featured that the S20+ and ultra contains. I am not disappointed,love the 120hz refresh rate along with the amazing battery. Going to get plenty of use out of this for the next 36 months I am contracted too!",
            "After years of giving apple a serious percentage of my salary, I decided to try the s20.  I chose the fe and I could not be happier. I can safely say I will never allow apple to darken my doorstep again",
            "Upgraded to this from Galaxy s9. Its a lovely phone, clear, good size but my reason for 4 stars is trying to do a screen shot is a joke. It's so fiddly as buttons same side and just doesn't work trying to do it with thumb",
            "Had Samsung for over 10yrs now .. had an s7 for 4yrs ... was reluctant to swap it was a good reliable phone but eventually bit the  bullet and got a s20 fe ... don't know why I was so worried.. it is beautiful and easy to use as always ..nothing from Samsung still the best",
            "Upgraded from the s9 and was worried this phone couldn't live up to the hype but was so happy I was wrong. Its incredibly fast and has the best camera ive ever used.",
            "I love everything about this phone its light and as lots of brilliant features",
            "I'm completely delighted with my S20 FE 5G. The processor gives rapid, smooth processing and stunning visual display. The 6.5inch scrreen is more than adequate for reading even the longest articles with ease. The camera allows me, the snap taker to become your actual photographer. I have to admit I am a Samsung mobile phone fan having enjoyed the Galaxy S5 then went on to the S7edge and progressed on to the S9. I was not expecting the quantum leap that is the S20 from the S9. Without reservation, I can thoroughly recommend this mobile phone",
            "Made the jump from iPhone and what a change it is, so refreshing to have a smart UX and simple design make this phone so much more powerful than Apple",

            "By far the best phone I've owned,it's speed around the osvsystem is breath taking and even adrenaline fuelled the first few weeks. My finger moved even when I stopped, beautiful crisp pictures taken at any angle, Fast download speeds, I've hit 160mbps so far and the router pumping out 886mbps, This phone will leave you for dust. Browse around, days go by in ten minutes with this phone, its like quantum leap speed! Perfection!!!!",
            "I got the s20 fe to replace my a 9 plus and I have to say, its on a par with it when I thought it would be a lot better, given the fe is brand new. In fact, the fingerprint scanner is actually better!",

            "Great phone in decent price, considering prices of smartphones today and definitely very good value. I am a bit disappointed of the size of my samsung fe 5g, cos 6.5 inch sounds big but that tall screen ratio of 20:9 making it very, very narrow.  Even my old samsung s8 plus was wider,so thats a bit let down for me ,especially that i am used to big phones.Every time i am using this phone there is that think- i wish the screen was bigger. Cameras are great,  big improvements over the s10 series for me. Battery is good, but could be a bit better. This phone works really fast and smooth,120 hz refresh rate is maiking the difference . Overall its a great value phone for sure better option in this price range than iphone 12 or pixel 5. I would definitely recommend this phone to everyone ,but if you like big phones then s20 plus is the better option.",

A great piece of tech and a great choice for someone wanting to upgrade but not spend too much.",
            "Tbh  its not brilliant its quite slow my p20 pro is better",
            "Brilliant  phone love  it great picture  and battery life good glad I brought it",
            "Phone is very responsive, great camera and easy to use",
            "After switching from a pixel 3xl to samsung I was worried about the android skin, as the pixel runs stock android but so far the experience has been wonderful, love this phone, love the display, love the 120hz refresh rate 5*",
            "Had an iPhone before a Samsung and never thought I'd change but using the new s20 Fe was really simple and easy to get to grips with. Can safely say I won't be going back to iPhone",
            "My new samsung galaxy S20 5G,\nIs the best phone I've had upto now, and at 60 I've had a few,\nIt's dead easy to use,and even better to operate, it's nice and simple, the photos are grate too.",
            "Smart lock? Useless. \nFingerprint sensor? Useless. \nMost expensive phone I've owned and after my iPhone, the worst.",
            "Great signal,  sound , picture. \nBest phone I've ever had.",
            "It's finally in my hand with all the available futures!!! I wanted to have dual sim.... just not happy with not included wireless earbuds.",
            "Loving the new phone gutted i cant claim the watch as i got the phone for xmas",
            "I've been away from Samsung phones for two years now. My last phone was the S8, the battery life was so bad I ditched it half way through the contract and went with the Huawei P20 Pro. The battery life on the P20 was amazing. Anyway my contract was coming to an end so I was looking for an alternative to the Huawei. I have been looking at reviews and this popped up about the amazing battery life. So I took the plunge. And wow, I have to say I can easily get two days with this phone. The phone itself doesn't really feel much like an upgrade from the P20 more a side step, just newer. The camera is not as good as the P20, but not a deal breaker for me. The smoothness of the screen is very noticeable, silky smooth! Overall I'm very happy with it.",
            "great phone sleek amd easy to use with a great interface only downfall being is the change of headphone port and the fact that no headphones are included in the box",
            "Fantastic phone fast and clear. Can't wait to link with watch.",
            "I like the phone because the phone is very interesting",
            "The camera is fenominal and the screen is just sharpest and smoothest I've ever had on a phone. This phone is an emulation beast being able to run game cube games at a stable 30 fps.\nNot much else I can really say tbh. I'd defo recommend to anyone",
            "Just replaced previous S9 with S20FE & got to say it is a very poor replacement. Lots of features now not available i.e. earphone jack, heart rate monitor just to name 2. Also fingerprint icon is now inconvieniently placed on front screen & doesn't always recognise saved fingerprint",
            "What can i say, it a great phone so far no problems.  Seams to work spot on. Had samsung phones for the last 4 years  with no problems.",
            "Absolutely love this phone. Quick responsive. Still finding out all it does.",
            "Love everything about the phone, the colur is awesome, shame I wasn't eligible for the watch active offer as it was an Xmas gift bought at the end of November,  but still an amazing phone",
            "After the update on the 1st January, some of the games on my phone have become difficult to use, the screen used to be centralised and now I need to touch slightly left or above where I need to be.\nI've been in touch with Samsung 2 times and the troubleshooting hasn't worked.",
            "I absolutely love this phone from the camera to note pad it has that many different features on it and the battery is really good too I am always on my phone  for work from doing Emails to video conference calls its amazing",

            "It has tonnes of apps already installed that help with everything from services to money.",
            "The camera is amazing and the phone is wonderful in its ease to use and the amount that you customise it to your own needs is brilliant",
            "Super phone very pleased with purchase",
            "Great on battery life saving and camera quality is super",
            "A great phone. Not to big but great viewing. Top marks to Samsung. Pictures a great detail. Music very clear and suits my taste in bass and treble. Easy navigation around software. Battery life lasts twice as long as my S9.\nRecommend this buy. £100 cheaper than the Apple iPhone 12 mini. Very satisfied.",
            "Great phone. Does have some features that on my S8 no longer work I.e. Videos used to show all my movies and TV downloaded but now on the S20 does not? Also there has been some applications that freeze like the camera? Reboot sorts it but never did that on my S8?",
            "Went back to samsung for this phone . Great to be back with samsung fast and smooth.",
            "Just received my new s20 fe and its amazing. Camera is brilliant",
            "The colours of the phone are amazing, nice video quality and also really good features. We also have signed up to receive the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active hope it arrives soon",
            "Works well and support is all good. \nDisplay is fantastic",
            "The camera is amazing however the battery let's this phone down for me. Dropped from 100% down to 81 in less than a hour.",
            "soft touches and easy to operate really having a good time using my new phone",
            "This is my first foray into Samsung phones. To be fair I don't know what my reluctance was before but I'm glad I did. Awesome phone with all the features I had with my last phone and more.",
            "Great phone. Does everything very responsive and a stunning screen. 5g is a big improvement. Camera takes top quality pictures and video. Cannot fault this hand set",
            "Fantastic phone, really impressed with the spec and features - did loads of research with other makes and models but this one seemed to offer the best all round value for money.",
            "Pretty nice phone. Plenty of storage for anything I'll need, huge screen to watch anything i want, and great speakers. The camera is amazing too. Overall a great phone",
            "Best phone I ever had, very smooth use and very strong phone. Really good for watching movies or listen to music",

            "Nice phone but fingerprint recognition rubbish doesn't work properly",
            "Everything about it is great, really lovely colour selections to choose from, geat camera and camera settings that can be changed to preference, night camera is amazing, sleek design great new updates and additions, only thing I will say I was disappointed on is battery life, I use my phone alot in the day time and my battery just seems to be a little more drained than other models previously owned and still own. For that reason I give a 4/5 the battery lasts all day however it would definately need to go on charge at night if your like me and use the phone 12 hours a day. Really impressed with this model and great value for money, would recommend to anyone.",
            "I like the way it doesn't slip out of your hands and a nice weogjt",
            "When S20 lineup came out I've purchased an S20 Plus and returned it after a week and I've said my next phone won't be a Samsung( poor battery, overheating in any app).But this S20 FE is a great phone overall. I'm happy it has the Snapdragon processor, is noticeable in special for the battery life,no overheating great performance. Camera quality is great i love the flat display and 120hz refresh rate.Samsung made this phone exactly how I wanted. No complaints. I recommend this phone to anyone who really wants a flagship phone at a smaller price.",
            "Brilliant phone would recommend to anyone who needs to upgrade",
            "Light weight, large screen, easy to navigate, excellent camera, superb quality phone",
            "Brilliant new Samsung phone but as usual some niggles.. about phone does not give your phone number, probably a software issue but apart from that hard to beat it..",
            "The features the phone offers and the price it stands at are unbeatable. Flagship features and specs in a much more affordable price range.",
            "I have been an Apple user for many years and was looking for an alternative and this fits the bill very well",
            "I received the Samsung S20 FE 4g device on Christmas day so I've been using it for a few days. The performance of the phone is excellent and the screen looks really nice at 120hz. It also has a brilliant camera which has a good range of zoom. \n\nHowever this is all let down by the phone having very poor battery life. The phone can feel warm to the touch after little use and it usually needs to be plugged in around 6pm which isn't at all ideal. Reviews of the 5g version state it has excellent battery life but as the 4g version of the phone has a different processor you will find this device to have a lot worse battery performance which is very misleading from Samsung.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this device as not having all day battery life is a big loss and I'm definitely thinking of returning it.",
            "It's simply the best all round phone of 2020 and at a REASONABLE price. (Unlike the now too expensive S+ and ultra lines!).\nFor 9 months now.. people have had a workaround for being able to use the amazing 120hz mode in power saving by doing a bigsby routine.. and it's now been patched in the new one Ui3 (And.11) update. So many people are really sad about this. We really loved being able to save battery and not needing to use any more than 70% Cpu power which is the biggest battery drain.. it worked perfectly well. WHY Samsung?. Can't you just PLEASE let us use 120hz in power saving mode? It works so why not allow it??",
            "I love this phone, truly I do, but I've been having so many issues. Particularly with the touch screen, certain areas just stop working!\nI've been using this phone for around 2 months now and if it wasn't for these things and maybe i had chosen a different colour haha, I would have been able to offer 5 stars",
            "Very heavy after a couple of minutes use.  Great sound quality",
            "Brilliant phone never go back to apple samsung is the best",
            "Phone is great bit so disappointed as they where doing free headphones for ages then they stopped it and now its a free watch. This is rubbish and it was a selling point that I was ment to get the wireless headphones with the phone but they stopped it and there's no headphone jack or headphones in the box. Big let down",
            "Love phone always buy Samsung .but I hate it when you get no instructions .am a pensioner.so not geared up for all this technology. Please tell me where to get instructions. PLEASE PLEASE .",
            "Camera on it is really good, the battery life is great I only have to charge it up once then im good to go all day!! And transferring all of my data was really easy made simple by smart switch, the only downside is when I Bluetooth my watch active 3 to it, this does drain the battery on it quicker, bit overall a good little phone which packs a punch and I love the colour on it!",
            "Great features, excellent design, simple to set up",
            "Quick, good camera, great for gaming and a good amount of storage",
            "Perfect and better.... more security and features are insane. The camera is outstanding. Also \nMake sure you play with this phone. I bet people only use about 20% if features",
            "You're better getting the s9 or s9+. This really isn't worth the money. I upgraded from an s9 and found it's actually equal if not better in performance. And there are so many features s9 features subtracted from the 'S20 fe' which doesn't make any sense. \nNot to mention the design of the s9 is much better, the speakers are better, the screen quality is better and there's a lot \nmore...\nPlease save your money, I don't even think Samsung thought this one through.\nShame bcuz I've been a Samsung for quite some time and now I'm stuck with this very odd and confused phone.",
            "When I'm doing my fingerprint it always doesn't go throw and it is really frustrating please fix ASAP",
            "my old galaxy s9 is better, biger resolution, screen without hole etc",
            "Easy to use, simple to transfer stuff from your old phone, great size, camera, apps...",
            "This phone is great. I have the S20 FE 128GB and I've owned it for less than a day and in completely mind blown. I've never had a Samsung phone and I'm very happy with my purchase. Consider purchasing the S20 FE.",
            "Honestly, Samsung hit it out the ballpark with this phone. It's got the latest features. I've got the Android 11 One UI3 update already. It's got one of the best cameras out there for this price bracket. Honestly. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a phone for themselves or to get it for their kids",
            "A little disappointed as I replaced the S10 which was much better phone but some good features.",
            "EVERYTHING IS GREAT, GREAT,  GREAT,  GREAT,  GREAT,!!",
            "Great phone and worked well until I upgraded to Android 11. Now I have a useless phone that can make calls but no data. This on many forums has occurred to Pixel phones since September 2020 yet to this day is happening. Samsung has let me down and luckily I have a iPhone 7 I could swop Sam's with. It makes me want to go back to iphone now.",
            "Simple and easy to use. Has everything I need and is easy to locate",
            "Great looking phone. wonderfull camera. all the good things from Samsung.\nonly bug bear so far, kept knocking volume button to of when in my pocket so have missed a few phone calls.",
            "Excellent features and excellent cameras  and night visionary",
            "After a day of usage the 6gb of memory had already been halved",
            "Absolutely amazing phone has everything you need plus more its by far the best phone iv ever had and I would recommend it to everyone, well done Samsung you really went all out on this one :-)",
            "Great phone, very responsive. Fingerprint scanner is a lot better than the s10. I really wish it had an aux input or an adaptor though.",
            "This is a remarkable step up for me, i am used to a s7 to this is not even in the same league. How fast it is, unbelievable I mean my thumb had started moving on its own to where the writing was,the adrenaline rush was amazing,ultra quality in camera,snapshot and video, I have only scratched the surface of what this phone is capable of and I cannot wait for the ride,one point Samsung you owe me a fit watch, I definitely put the form in on time naughty boys....love the phone and if they release another phone when my contract expires I'll be getting that,only if they get the new inbuilt snap dragon software though.",
            "Its every thing I need in one device with great price.  Build quality is better than I expected. Got all expensive features. I'll have before s10 and s7 so this one got everything  what they have and even more.",
            "Great Phone overall, good features runs smoothly and quick. Games and apps run without issue and the camera is awesome",
            "The Samsung s20 fe 128gb is a great phone i had ios for years so buying a samsing was a big deal for me , but im so pleased with my choice it does exactly what iy says its actually easier to navigate, than ios and the camera an photo qaulity are excellent.",
            "What don't like is battery not great but love other features of the Samsung galaxy s20 FE 5g",
            "I think this a fantastic phone to have as a budget s20. \nBattery life is stellar and the speed of the phone is very acceptable. \nMy only criticism is the camera as I had a a71 before and can't say this is an upgrade over it .\nPhotos seem washed out and the focus doesn't seem to work as it should.",
            "One of the main reasons I upgraded to S20 FE 5G was the battery life and it sure didn't disappoint!\n\nI now move around worry free about charging,  usually lasts me 2 days with normal usage...which includes a 30 muns zoom call everyday! So its pretty awesome.",
            "No proximity sensor so the screen doesn't turn off when I put it to my ear (the camera is useless for this)\n\nTouchscreen issues.\n\nPoor battery life on the Exynos version.\n\nOther than that it's an amazing phone",
            "Good cameras glad I've upgraded , my daughter is so jealous",
            "Fingerprint is very bad,there is no words how bad it's. Almost smashed my phone",
            "Great camera \nNice features and easy to use ,from apple phone",
            "This phone is a banger! Unbelievable.  Its 8gb of ram does not struggle at all, even with big games.\nIts AR tech is brilliant aswell.",
            "Changed from a s20 to the s20fe and not looked back, its a fantastic phone, cannot fault it",
            "Easy to use! Fast and with wonderful quality graphics. The screen size is perfect for a phone. I love the mint colour. I take a lot of nature pictures and the pixels on the camera have been excellent. Overall I love this phone. It's a pleasure to handle it!\nThe only disappointment is the lack of headphones... the buds are really expensive and there were no alternative in the box... I cannot use my old headphones in the current socket... I wish they had put an adaptor or better still suitable headphones.",
            "I love the phone, watching movies is the best on it, but I still can't claim the watch that I was supposed to get with the bundle that I paid for, everytime I go to claim it, it says I need a code/reference number from an email I never got.",
            "I love my new fone  it's so nice and I would my family",
            "No need for big tech comments. It is simply a great phone.",
            "This phone is brilliant fast secure the only problem is that even when you are not using your phone apps open them self. You can close all apps and the next time you go  on it, it will say that you have used other apps that I've not used,, please sort this out as it drains battery life which will make the phone battery life  carp in the long run",
            "Good phone great battery life\nWould 100% recommend",
            "So this was a great buy, I have had Samsung phones for a good few years now and have held on to each handset for 3years plus but this caught my eye and man was it worth it. The new camera features are great with a new 30x zoom and one shot mode and a better night mode. The phones battery is better aswell as I'm not on it all day but I do use it a lot and for long periods of time and I go to bed with 50ish percent from my last s9 only 10ish percent being left in the battery so this is great",
            "I love all the features and fun things on the phone, the camera is great, I've come from iPhone after many years and glad I did.",
            "Very easy to set up down load app great every thing i need in a phone at great price",
            "When I close my apps and turn my phone off (not power off just off) and turn it on later. Either Google, email, phone, calender and the call apps are open... why?",
            "This phone is really good for the price, has everything I want, 120hz, Snapdragon 865 and enough memory, however I have had more issues with the touch screen on this phone than any other phone I have ever owned. There are times where touches won't register, I can barely swipe on the phone screen to unlock it which requires a reboot. This is after 2 software updates claiming to improve the issue. Overall a really good phone but let down by the touch screen",
            "It's big and a bit heavy...my battery didn't last a day until I've changed my battery settings and I'm not even playing games\nStill has lots of great features and it's worth buying",
            "love my red Samsung s20 so easy to use  love the fact it comes with a screen protector ,love the size and the fact its still has a nice curved edge style to it  camera is very good and I find it easy to use a features",
            "Ignore what people say about the back being plastic save money and get this phone its perfect, size is great for videos so if you have small hands you might struggle camera is good over system is on point and screen quality you just can't go wrong with. Buy it",
            "Great response screen, light weight ,good value ,best yet",
            "Better performance\nBetter price\nBetterchoice\nIt's a good smart phone!",
            "I love everything about it, performance is flagship level, camera is beastly. The the only thing is the 4k@30 is abit choppy and battery isn't the best.",
            "I like it but is poor to type with for a left handed person also the space bar is does not consistently work and the its allto easy to hit the middle action key and jump from what you are doing",
            "Cameras amazing, ive just recieved my new handset and I'm loving im it already",
            "Nice big screen which is helpful for my eyesight, phone runs smoothly as well and switching between apps is a lot quicker than my last phone, overall very very happy with my new phone",
            "Just had the Samsung galaxy s20 fe mobile  and the on/off button has fallen off  really not happy!!!",
            "Most things you can edit quite well.\nI find the keyboard a little annoying but I think its mostly because predicted text is guessing words that are similar to how the word has been misspelled but not changing based on the keys next to the intended key being clicked by mistake.\n\nThe screen is too sensitive around the edge \n\nDon't particularly like the chrome on the edge / front looks a little tacky",
            "Great phone has all that I need in a phone great build feels good in hand software is good my only issues are that a few Apps eg Mario kart will not go full screen even tho I set them to do so I am hoping this is a bug that can be fixed but the overall experience is excellent.",
            "This is my new phone after along time since I've got it I really liked it",
            "Everything works, no lag in loading, easy to use features.",
            "Really satisfied with this model. Easy to use. Quality photos. Loads of excellent apps.",
            "Wonderful features, and quick software. Smart Battery life for who loves their phone",
            "After trying all the ultra models (I normally go with the note) I felt disappointed with the heat coming from the back when just drawing plus I can't understand why we don't get the choice of specs we pay as much as every other country but have had inferior devices and I'm not putting Samsung down as I love the Samsung phones always have so I felt disappointed then learned that the S20ge 5g had the snapdragon 865 chipset so I tried it and its amazing ok there's no super amoled display but I can't tell and I always used the 120hz refresh a anyway so its on all the time and the phone is 5g plus it was much cheaper so I got the galaxy watch as well and its still cheaper than the note 20. So yes this S20 fe 5g is a beast , I hope the new exynos 2100 coming in 2021 is at least on the same level as the new 888 snapdragon , I've been loyal to Samsung all the way back to the Samsung E715 flip so I need top S21 and its released on my birthday so thats a good sign..",
            "I recently upgraded from then galaxy s10 plus, which was also an excellent phone. I've only had the galaxy s20 FE for just under a week but I've got to say, the screen is amazing at 120Hz its just seamless.\n\nAs well as that all the features are great, being able to make your own sound profile is a particularly good feature, as sound quality is a very dificult thing to get right with everyone having their own preferences.",
            "Great features like expected. Only downside is no 3.5mm headphone jack port:(",
            "Love this Phone. Buying my Wife one! If I can get through",
            "I don't think there are any negatives I've found so far.",
            "Best cost benefits ever i love this phone , I had a Google pixel 4, and a upgrade for galaxy s20fe I felt a big difference,  the galaxy is way better",
            "No frills, fast ,excellent screen,  loads of memory,,,,what more could you want",
            "Keeps freezing and going to black screen would return it had for less then 2 months",
            "It is a good phone and I love it all the time and the pictures is amazing",
            "Brilliant features lovely to hold and so many colours",
            "All is working well and the battery life is great, around 6-7 hours off one charge. There's a small issue where sometimes the camera is a black screen untill i restart the phone.",
            "Upgraded from S8 performance is great coverage great smart looking phone",
            "Its like using a  Prehistoric brick and casing is cheap",
            "Still having a lot of touch screen problems with this phone. it would be a brilliant phone apart from this but keep your money for a phone that actually works.",
            "S series gets better and better with every new release.",
            "Got this as an upgrade to my S9. Quite an upgrade too! Twice as fast and battery lasts literally twice as long! Haven't got a 5G sim yet so haven't tested that yet.",
            "I've tried other brands of phone and never had the reliability or ease of use my S20FE provides",
            "Good phone much bigger than the last phone i had also it as dark mode",
            "Best phone I've ever had great camera very fast brilliant battery life. Had it 2 weeks no problems",
            "I was initially worried about 6gb ram since I had an s10 before which often went over 5gb usage at a time, but this phone struggles to use more than 4gb at a time presumably due to a better memory controller. Feels very fast and fluid. Had a few bugs and yes the screen issues are real, but they're also few and far imbetween.",
            "Nice phone, Nice upgrade to my old one, had the old s9",
            "It is easy to use and lovely photo quality.  Would definitely recommend",
            "Had an s8 plus which was already amazing but this s20 fe just blows it away, get the 5g version for snapdragon!",
            "With so much choice available, selecting an upgrade from my trusty s8 was a difficult one but so far the s20 FE is not only a better looking phone, the features are far superior and more user friendly.  Very eased with my upgrade so far!!",
            "The phone has been absolutely fantastic to use, with the fast charging and efficient power management by the snapdragon processor, battery life has been amazing. The screen is absolutely gorgeous despite having a lower pixel density, the camera is comparable to samsubg's flagship phones and takes high quality pictures. Absolutely love the phone.",
            "I love not having to carry around a charging port for half way through the day. \nThe camera is on point... the sound quality is so good...",
            "Good great exelent camera softwor everyfing  is good",
            "Excellent Quality from Samsung yet again comes with 5G pictues are ace am so pleased I got this phone not another Phone I had a day and I got nothing bad to say about the Samsung FE",
            "Great phone overall, some premium features are not available but at this price, it's great",
            "They have done away with the 3.5mm socket for headsets. This means you have to buy a USB c to  3.5 mm adaptor to use your headsets. Having done this it keeps coming up the connected USB device is unsupportive.This is a major problem  many examples on you tube. No matter what I try and do I can't get the headsets to work ,including samsung headsets. However to get round this problem you don't need to use headsets at all. All you need to do is to hold the phones speaker next to your ear. Not ideal but its better then nothing. Apart from that it's a good phone.",
            "Great phone, great display with very good refreshment.  I recommend",
            "None think very poor battery run,s flat after one day even not use would not recommend do not buy this mobile s20 is rubbish",
            "Totally love it, had it a week had the s7 which is a good phone.\nBut the s20 is outstanding.\nStill finding something new every day..\nHope I still will be enjoying this phone in 5 years...",
            "I think it seem to be great especially with its photographic options",
            "Love how its got a good battery life and can sea things a lot clearer",
            "I have just recently taken delivery of 2 Samsung S20 fe’s.  I read a lot of reviews prior to ordering, some were negative about heat and battery consumption.\n\nMy thoughts are this after 3 days of use.  I am highly satisfied with both phones.  There isn’t any excessive heating when in use, the battery only loses 1% of its charge per hour in standby mode and It’s at least 3 times faster accessing Apps than my old J4 plus.\n\nI would highly recommend this handset.",
            "Love it.....its fast with apps decent fingerprint scanner what actually works...!!!\nGood size and weight highly recommended",
            "The worst  phone  i ever  brought.  Not good in every  way.",
            "Just a great phone, all the bits and pieces you need and you don't have to spend a fortune, keep bringing out the \"FE\"",
            "Battery not good enough. Don't last longggggggg...",
            "I love the general use of this device, upgrading from the s9+, I have a few different uses and experiences for this phone. I'm hoping that while I have adjusted a lot on this device I can see the benefit of a bigger battery, while it's also 5g ready I'm still waiting for my area to be developed to sustainable 5g coverage. The only downside I have is the zoom on the camera past 10x is poor pixels and focus. Im also having to work out best part of performance regarding battery life. 1/2 days at most but change to optimised I'm struggling for a whole day. Thanks Samsung",
            "Excellent phone, easy to use. Would recommend to anyone",
            "Love the size of phone very quick and easy to use would highly recommend",
            "I like the phone but the selfie camera is awful. I had a S20 plus before this with which I never had a problem. The colour on the selfies are washed out, my skin tone looks awful, I took photos using the FE and my old phone under the same light conditions etc, the selfies from the FE are horrible, I have played about with the settings and there is nothing that fixes it. If you like to take selfies then don't buy this phone. I am considering sending it back.",
            "Love everything about it. Top phone from Samsung thanks",
            "Mostly a half decent phone. Good camera and nice features. Battery is alright. However the finger print scanner is dreadful. Makes unlocking a real pain. Fix that and the phone would be an all round good.",
            "Coming from an s20+ there's not a noticeable difference in size, battery life or screen. Whats amazing is including the snapdragon 865 instead of exynos. Just the right number of cameras with decent resolution and solid glass, metal, plastic design",
            "Great phone but, the touch screen has a slight issue however is manageable but would like to see further updates about the issue later on",
            "Best samsung I've ever owned 5/5 looks great performs amazing",
            "Love everything about the s20 FE I wouldn't change it live the size of the screen",
            "Only had it a couple of days . So getting used to it camera looks great. Big screen i love it at the moment not gone through it all yet.",
            "Great size to hold easy navigation around the phone to apps still try to use all features but great camera",
            "The camera is amazing I can't get over the quality. The phone itself feels strong and sturdy. Even the sound quality without headphones is brilliant.",
            "Absolutely fantastic. I love my new phone.\nI recommend it. Of course",
            "Such a flowing device, no hold ups or slowing down. And one awsome camera",
            "Customisable,  easy to use, great screen, good looking phone",
            "Accurate skin tones on selfie, unlike what cloned reviewers said on YouTube. Sound is very good too, the stereo speakers are better than reviewers said. Battery is good, and charged up 40% in 30 mins with 15W charger out of box. Nothing bad i can say apart from the plastic back to me makes it feel cheap, but I've got a protector on it and I'm sure it will be fine. I'd recommend this phone simply because you are going to have to pay twice as much to beat it, and it certainly beats everything in the same price range.",
            "Super fast loving the phone I would recommend this phone to everyone",
            "The phone itself is pretty good. It is a bit large (after upgrading from the s9). All feature seem to be good and feedback is quick also. Only downside is the fingerprint scanner works when It wants to.",
            "I like  camera is excellent. Thought I'd get 4months free utube premium though",
            "Such a great phone and for a very keen price. Really impressed with the performance, battery life, build quality, sound and display. Even the standard apps like email and calendar are excellent.",
            "lovely phone nice and slim ,long battery life ,nice and sharp photos ,great sound too form the music with headphones on .",
            "Hello samsung! Iv recently just got the S20 FE and i have mixed reviews all good but am going from what samsung phone i used to have \"s8\" to the S20 FE.\nSo the phone is amazing i just wish it felt abit better in the hand, the s8 was glass and when i held it i just felt so cool with it, with the S20 FE it feels good just not as good as the s8, the software is amazing and feels all fresh the screen and camrea feels not as good as the s8  it felt more crisp and better quality, i bought my new S20 FE about 2 months ago and just got used to everything with it, id rate this a 7.5  just because i think the camera quality and screen quality could be better for how much this was",
            "Great screen lots of useful features",
            "Been using Samsung for a while now and never had a issue or concern. Not sure it it's the software or phone but man is it glitches all the time, keeps hanging up on my phone calls, random stuff like not inputting texts, pressing one button and it carrys out a completely different task? I hate it.",
            "If you're in the market for a marvellous phone, this one will do you very nicely.  Just remember not to catch it in your zip when putting it away as it's rather long. I should already have known about that issue through non-phone-based experience.",
            "Everything, like, I love  the design, the touch screen is fast and the detail that's the finger print is incorporated within it makes it marvelous. Cámara is on point. Velocity of the running of the apps is just perfect . Plus the cool small details.",
            "Great and love the phone.  Very disappointed  first time in 10 years out off all the upgrades i have had this is the first one without headphones.  Which I regularly   use going to work etc",
            "The phone is very  fast and everything that this phone has that the s10 was the worst phone I had I like my S20 Fe",
            "I've gone from iPhone to Samsung and love everything about the Samsung s20fe  expect the battery",
            "phone is seriously flawed. with battery saving maxed out it lasts about 10h when left alone,  if you use it actively it won't last even till launch break. WORST phone EVER !!!",
            "I love my Samsung galaxy s20 fe it has a gorgeous design easy to use, I love all the apps and great features it has I would highly recommend it",
            "Go for the 5g snapdragon version. Faster, runs cooler during gaming and battery life is better. 1 star removed due to the occasional touchscreen responsiveness issues.",
            "Really like everything about you have to own one to understand it it amazing",
            "I love all Samsung,  been buying Samsung phones for years ,  I love my new s20fe its features are amazing , the bright sharpness of the screen and pictures are great , east to use , basically an all 4ound great phone",
            "Still getting to grips with the features.camera so far seems very good but need some good weather to make the most of it! Still a tri in the garden using as seen and full 30x zoom looks very good! The phone is very fast and a great improvement to my last one.",
            "This is a great phone for the price. It has a plastic backing instead of glass or aluminum, but you don’t notice with a case. Looks and feels premium. I would recommend to anyone looking to buy any mid-to-flagship Samsung phone.",
            "It's so terrible to see almost no difference between the s20 and s20fe. What's the vision here Samsung? Customers who purchased the s20 early this year are left furious to find a cheaper and almost a better version showing up toward end of the year. I don't think s20 deserve to be sold even a cent above the s20fe. Rubbish business strategy Samsung. I have lost confidence on your product value for money.",
            "Fun phone great value for money would highly recommend!!!!",
            "Just having problems waking it up.  \nFingerprint set location- my house- won't so forever pressing button and then passcode.\nVolume quality for calls very poor crackles and tin sounding\nEqualiser poor\n\nReally not happy",
            "Brilliant value for the phone. I would of gone with a full s20 or s20 ultra but their too expensive for what you gain from them. So this is nice just to dip your toes in. I wouldn't really call it a fan edition tho as it is much cheaper compared to the full on s20's and the note 20\n\nBrilliant camera a nice upgrade compared to my s8+ but one mistake with it is i would of rather more battery life over the camera zoom which in quality I find useless",
            "Amazing camera, fast processor, great screen light and tough",
            "Great features, runs smoothly and has an amazing camera. Couldnt be more pleased!",
            "Hoenstly at first I thought this phone was great. I upgraded from a galaxy s7 to this s20, the issues I have found though is when using apps like Snapchat the camera will stop working so I have constantly restart my phone about 3 times a day, which Is very annoying! The same goes for Netflix when I try to mirror it to the chrome cast it will sometimes not work so I'm starring at a blank screen on my TV. Little things like that. Other than that the camera quality ( when it works) is excellent, the speed is good but could be better it does lag sometimes.. plenty of storage which is great and I like the built im Bixby voice commands there fun to play with.",
            "Amazing display n camera best quality design very smart..",
            "So, so midrange phone. But unfortunately I'm going back to my P30 Pro.",
            "Great features,stunning looking phone,easy to use,very fast and efficient",
            "I pre ordered it i received in few day I love it does everything I want aswell brilliant phone would definitely recommend anyone",
            "Camera and all the new features...\nPerformance is very good ... the battery is not getting hot ...\nFor my big ✋  the size is great...",
            "I went from a Note 4 via an S8 to this beauty! So fast, especially the screen,  it needed some adjusting time. \nLove the deal I got here with Samsung,  both insurance and trade in wise. \nNice to have the latest phone for a change! And a relatively affordable one. The savings on my now sim only contract are  so much. \nAnd, the service from the Samsung Hub was phenomenal,  being helped by people who actually really enjoy their job makes such a difference.",
            "Just an amazing phone,from the sound quality to the picture, its just great",
            "I have the ultra and I found it a bit\nbulky at work so I purchased the fe 5g and its very good in comparison to my 20 ultra just not as powerful with the camera but its still a very powerful phone at a good price",
            "Benn away from Samsung for awile and I am so glad to be back,the s20 fe 5g is amazing,all the features you want and an amazing price.",
            "Everything is so easy and just beautiful to hold and great photos.",
            "Would tell a friend to get a s20 fe and I have iphone for 11 years so big change for me",
            "The only issue I'm having is my centre bottom button is not working and have to use button on side but prob a setting for that? Otherwise a great phone like all my samsungs",
            "The phone has a greater visual experience  to any phone I have had before. It also offers everything I need for my separate business needs,  great camera, wireless live buds, awesome apps and good battery life",
            "One of the best phones for the price it comes at!!",
            "Good, quick phone with lots of cool featured apps and quirky yet handy features",
            "Just started using my new phone .. galaxy S20 FE 5G and I love it as I've been a Samsung galaxy fan for years all the features were so easy to find .. camera: well im a constant walker and use my phone for taking pictures and I have tried this camera and well what can I say only outstanding amazing just love it .. I can go on so ill stop and just say .... Samsung you've done it again you've created a phone to top all phones",
            "Touchscreen is terrible, far too sensitive.\nWhen to connected to speaker or earphones volume is so low its a waste of time. Also don't bother trying to claim free watch with it they make it almost impossible to claim it. Wouldn't recommend and won't be getting samsung again.",
            "I was gonna buy the note 20 ultra. But I think this phone is just as good if not slightly better. The battery lasts all day even at my high usage. Not 100%sure if I've actually experienced 5g but the phone does say I have it from time to time.",
            "5g is great makes so much difference receiving 250mbps download",
            "First of all I love the buttery smooth 120hz display, battery with the Snapdragon 865 is better then my previous phone S10+ Exynos, chipset is great paired with One UI. I really like the colour I chose Cloud Orange.",
            "Had my s20 fe about 2 weeks now, its a good phone with some great features. \n\nI moved from Huawei p20 due to the overall phase out of this branded technology and I have to say apart from the camera and the screen resolution the Huawei still comes out on top for me.",
            "Had mine a week and its like the speaker has a rattle to it that wasn't there brand new it hasn't been hashed around its so frustrating lovely phone",
            "Probably the best mobile I've owned - good work Samsung.",
            "Phone is quick.. like I've never experienced a phone this quick.. I have a lot of stuff on my phone.. music photos etc and with older phones I've always struggled with the loading times because the phone is so clogged up. This phone transitions into different apps.. web pages, anything I do without even the smallest of thinking times. \nGreat camera.. shame it did not have the macro camera like some mid range Samsung's but otherwise still great.\nGreat battery, great sound coming out of the phone too. Love the optitof having two Sims or a SIM and an SD card in the same phone. Smart",
            "Moved from an S10e. The only reason for this was the poor battery life. \n\nS20FE is brilliant. Far better battery. Far batter camera but one draw back......awful finger print scanner. On the s10e the scanner was on the power button and worked great every time. I've had to disable it on the S20FE as I kept being locked out. I do not know Samsung persist with the on screen scanner, it's terrible.",
            "Good camera, fast, battery its good.",
            "On paper this phone should be amazing. Amazing camera and screen. Amazing battery life. One small issue.\n\nI, along with many other users, have faced touch screen issues making the phone a pain to use. Scrolling and using Google maps is near impossible. Such a shame. Issue persisted in replacement unit.",
            "Great cameras. Great sound. Very fast. Long battery life. Great screen. Recommend!",
            "Battery life is 2 days but there are no updates arriving. Where are onesie beta??\nThis phone is left last to be updated",
            "Only had phone over 2 weeks and already having problems with it",
            "Easy to use love it.everything about it is amazing.",
            "Absolutely love my new device, its super responsive compared to my previous S10+ the speakers are amazing! Especially the picture quality when streaming videos and gaming, the camera quality is one that I'd think could rival that of a nikon lense, and outright knocks IPhone out of the ball park, best phone I've ever purchased, I cant wait to see how Samsung top the bar next time because I think they have already done it with this device!",
            "Coming from OnePlus 6, I see improvement  (120Hz screen, camera, microSDXC card). However, the amount of unwanted software, 1/2 integrated 3rd part (branded as Samsung), privacy & data sharing agreement prompts on every action etc is just beyond my imagination. I'm cleaning the phone (that's its also made almost impossible), but still struggle to get what I've paid for (i.e. decent hardware, that isn't slowed down by BIxby, ARemoticons, etc)",
            "Fast, great screen and wonderful camera. \n\nHowever fingerprint sensor is a little sluggish, and the touchscreen had some slight glitches earlier but these have mostly been smoothed out with software updates. \n\nAlso when in call the screen doesn't dim properly very often, which is off-putting at night and can lead to accidental touches.",
            "I love the way it looks and feels,the speed is amazing aswell.",
            "I am a bit of a dodo with androids this is my first and with a bit of help am getting used to it. Finding it fairly easy at the moment. The functions are easy to use and have tried the camera which is better than my normal one. Really  impressed!",
            "Great phone and camara . Has loads of features I love good for gaming and watching films",
            "Very little spec diffences from the S20 ultra, which was too big and heavy in my hand. This is perfect size with very few differences in spec. The fingerprint sensor is very difficult to register first time, but then in normal use is fine, hence 4 star and not 5.",
            "Amazing camera, Great storage, Very fast, Sleek lightweight design, Fantastic features and all in all the best phone I've ever owned.",
            "Love the snapdragon cpu over the samsungs own cpu gaming much faster and smoother",
            "Great phone, amazing screen, responsive even when you throw lots of multi tasking at it. Gaming is fluid and sharp, sound is punchy and engaging.Camera has so much to offer and single take is awesome. This is worth the wait to get you won't be disappointed. Such an amazing product Samsung love it.",
            "Great phone. Brilliant camera, fast actions.\nNo issues so far. A good choice of upgrade.",
            "I bought this phone to replace S10+, and I couldn't be happier. It's like S20FE 5G was talor made for me. It has everything that I need from a perfect phone - amazing back and front cameras (in S10+, the front camera was poor), amazing screen, flawless fingerprint scanner, good connection, amazing sound quality via both headphones and speakers, great battery life. And it does not have the features that I don't need and don't want to pay for: 8K video recording; curved edges; glass back, etc. And it's great to finally officially get a Samsung phone in the UK with a Snapdragon processor, which is by a mile better than Samsung's own (and it shows in the quality of picture processing as well). I can't be happier with S20 FE 5G, and I definitely recommend it!",
            "Love the camera, night mode is pretty great. Other than that, nothing to write home about.\nThe battery however is absolutely awful! Except a much better battery life from a smart phone now.",
            "Briĺliantly useful!!! Judt as usable as my s8 but a bigger screen sobi can see it better!!!:)",
            "I got the phone a few days ago I love it the camera is great and they phone is so easy to use. Only downside Is it didn't come with any headphones which I wasn't advised about when purchasing the phone",
            "Love my new phone which is more light weight than the s10 and much quicker.",
            "Very aesthetically pleasing, large screen and a good quality performance. It charges very quickly and has a good battery life. I love it",
            "Great fone, great pics, amazing sound, had the Ultra, until it fell out of my pocket... bought this instead, more in love with this FE than the Ultra.",
            "i am in love with the significantly fast refresh rate 120Hz.",
            "I just love this Device..Samsung have done it again..I have had some great android device's over the years but Samsung are in my personal opinion are way ahead of the game.\nVaue for money\nLots of features \nIt does everything that you would want a Phone to do.\nWell Done Samsung !\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Samsung Android experience is slick and effective. Sound and vision are high quality. Camera good. Size comfortable to hold. Battery life gets you through the day.",
            "I have been with Samsung for a very long time an every upgrade gets better n better wow a beautiful phone very impressed.",
            "I love the large screen and how it goes from edge to edge and the camera",
            "Coming back on Samsung after using iphone 11 pro max ...the 120hz display makes the phone smoother and faster , and snapdragon 865 processor is amazing!!!",
            "I'm absolutely loving my new phone. No issue with transferring my data. Within 10min everything was sorted and I was able to use my phone straight away. The Phone is so easy to use. My camera is absolutely amazing.",
            "So easy to use on all around the photo is excellent",

            "Photos on rear camera not as good as my old s9 doesn't seem to be able to focus properly hopefully updates will sort this.\nFingerprint sensor a bit temperamental \nTouch screen sometimes not as good as could be.",
            "What more could you want, future proof it with more ram perhaps? Despite the lower ram the phone is great and no lagging or sticking yet while multi tasking. The camera on screen is slightly annoying as it sticks out like a sore thumb while browsing but you get used to it, even better the curved screen is gone which means applying a screen protector is simple. The 5G works great if you test the speed you see  massive gains. May not need to upgrade for the next 4 years if the phone survives.",
            "I needed to run a multi app, as part of online gameplay, to access multiple accounts. The iphone just wasn't up to it, but this basic s20 does the business.",

            "Beautiful phone with lovely features and easy to use",
            "I absolutely love this phone if you play games or like taking pictures this is the phone for you the 3 cameras ensure you get the perfect picture and the graphics for the games are fabulous. So glad i waited a little longer to upgrade as I was going to have the s10. Would recommend to anyone who likes playing games and taking pictures. Samsung health is also brilliant and helps me keep track of my daily step count. Would definitely recommend this phone to all my family and friends",
            "It does help you with virtually everything! Except your own music for ringtone s",

            "Sleek and camera is excellent.love it love it love it",
            "I like the fact that Samsung have bought out a more affordable version of an S model phone. I had an S8 and was due an upgrade, and the S20 Fe was in my price bracket, and does everything I require and then some. The functions in comparison to my S8 feels a lot smoother and quicker. The camera seems good.  However I don't like the placement of the front camera. You can't have it all, and sometimes have to compromise to stick within budget (this was mine).  Yes the back is plastic, but my phone lives in a case, and to be fair it didn't feel cheap. Setting the phone up was easy, love all the Google assist stuff. Overall very happy.",

            "Brilliant phone to use. Only one thing I would change about it and thats the camera not being flush with the back",
            "I really like this phone. Great screen, super quick and manageable in one hand. Battery life is good and don't worry about plastic back, you won't notice it and it still feels premium",
            "Upgraded from S9 Plus and it's an amazing experience.",
            "Battery life does not last for even the wholeday! Planningtogo back to galaxy S10",
            "Great phone camera is a bit fuzzy when zoomed in at 30 % but still takes an ok picture",
            "Very easy to use. Good size. Clear camera. Really good mobile.",
            "Loving  the phone ...so easy to use and great quality",
            "An excellent choice for those that prefer the mid range. So many flagship features remain.",
            "So stylish and easy to use. It's a dream to have. Amazing value for money",
            "Easy to get used to, after being a Sony device user for many years.\nFirst Galaxy I've had since the S3",
            "Well Samsung have done it again, another excellent product. When upgrading your phone, you always worry about usage, will I lose any of my details or photos, contacts,  well the simple smart switch allows you to transfer everything safely.  My previous model was the Samsung Galaxy S10, but the S20FE has a larger battery, more storage space, the camera is just fantastic,  my only negative remark is the S20FE came all boxed and sealed,  once opened found there were no earphones or earphone connection lead.",
            "It gets the job done similar to a flagship at a more available price.",
            "The display and camera are excellent and almost on par with the flagships, and although the back is plastic, it does not feel cheap and will not feel different if you put a case on it. The main selling point of this phone for people like me in the uk is the fact is has the snapdrahon 865 chip, which outperforms the exynos 990 found in any samsung available in the uk right now. Overall, an excellent phone",
            "Every electronic device that i own is Samsung. No other brands come close, especially when it comes to mobile phone devices. Camera quality is top notch, easy format to navigate and the features are amazing.",
            "Another great from samsung, everything you need on one device. Excellent screen qs always and all the features if its big brother the S20.",
            "Really like this phone a few years ago I went with a different brand (Huawei mate 20 pro) after years with Samsung but I’ve now returned to Samsung with this flag ship phone and it’s great, still getting use to the different settings and enjoying every minute of it.",
            "The best galaxy phone yet. Smart and with great battery life. Wireless charging ideal",
            "Love the feel of the phone. The camera is better than expected especially the night mode.",
            "Brilliant choice for my upgrade.. sleek, great colour choices the camera slo- mo feature is mint .and love the heads up on scam phone calls you know when to block at the press off a button .",
            "Fantastic pixels on camera takes amazing photos.Brilliant features to explore.I love it",
            "Great features, battery not as long as expected.  Light to hold. Love the colour choices.",
            "This is the best phone I have ever bought the camera is to die for. I love how the words come up when your texting which is great for me as I an dyslexic. I love the funky colours as normal Samsung colours are boring  but they have so much right with this phone the only thing wrong with this phone is you don't get earphones with it apart from that it has so much going for it well done Samsung.",
            "I've been away for a while, went from an S8 plus to a Huawei P30 Pro.  Sorry Samsung, the P30 Pro was an absolutely fantastic phone, if it wasn't for Trump I wouldn't have come back.  Anyway, the S20FE 5g is an excellent phone, 865 processor and 6g of ram coupled with a 120mhz screen, whats not to like.  Curved screen, nah was a gimmick, made it easier to break the screen that a flat one.  It took me a day to get samsungs ui 2.5 to work like EMUi, by using the Google equivalents, now I'm happy a fabulous phone with a usable interface.  Gripes, samsung keyboard and its autocorrect, that's about it.   Definitely a premium phone killer for a reasonable price.  Let's see how far Samsungs 3 year update promise goes.  Looking forward to Android R, S and T :)",
            "Great phone .......................................",
            "I love my new phone and its very easy to work. And the best  phone  ever",
            "I've only had this phone for a few hours and I am really impressed with both the camera and the phone features.",
            "Its greT tge larger screen is fantastic!  Eoukd gave preferred a stronger orange on the colour.... tge protective cover on it osles the orange and nsjes it look pastel.... I would gave preferred a bright citrus orange...",
            "Excellent phone , fast and smart.  \nEverything what you need",
            "Been a long time since my last Samsung phone which says a s2 which with in weeks got screen burn so I've stayed away from amoled screened phone's.\n\nBut finally decided to get one as it seems most mid to high end phone use a oled screen these days. \n\nAnd so far I'm impressed with s20 fe things I love the most are, the screen 120hz is so nice makes everything so smooth and along with the snapdragon 865 everything is also so snappy, and I'm not fan of curved screens so finding a highish end phone with flat screen is a bonus, no expensive screen protector needed. \n\nBattery life as been excellent get about 4-5 hours hmm on time with about 40-60% battery remaining to can't complain. \n\nIs also nice that you can uninstall most of the boat ware that you won't use which is move. \n\nCamera is also excellent especially the night mode don't know how it does it but you would think it was daylight and not just a street light or the light from the TV. \n\nAnd its the first phone well smart/android phone that doesn't get hot it to the touch it get warm at the worst and that's with a case on. \n\nOverall the best phone I've ever owned can't fault it well apart from the touch issues but only when using the screen touch test app not really noticed it in day to day use but I'm sure Samsung will fix this in a update.",
            "Great phone good size screen long battery life",
            "Has great 5g camera is very clear like the 30 times zoom",
            "Amazing phone. The 120hz display is very smooth and brings out nice vivid colours. Scrolling down in apps is very satisfying. With the 4,500MAh battery and screen at FHD+ at 120Hz, battery life is amazing with an average of 6 hours of screen on time. 15W charging has been great with the phone also capable of 25W charging meaning charging on the go isn't a problem. \n\nWith the 3 cameras, the photo quality are crystal clear for normal, zoom and ultra wide shots. Video recording available at 4k with an option for live focus video makes video experience even better. The front facing camera takes some nice shots but sometimes skin tones are slightly off depending on lighting. \n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor seemlessly enables you to game, multitask and take quality photos. With 128GB of storage, there is plenty of space for games, apps, documents and photos and videos. \n\nOverall, this phone is great for the price. With 5G and Snapdragon 865 (UK) this phone is probably one of the best in the S20 line up when it comes to processing power compared to the Exynos varients of the S20 series. Although the glass used is Gorilla glass 3, you can easily get screen protectors which fit on nicely and also enables the use of the optical fingerprint reader.",
            "This has got to be one of the best Samsung devices I've had in years.... That's due to the snapdragon chip. Would not go back to exynos now",
            "Sorry to say this but I wished I didn’t sell my iPhone as this Samsung fe20 not as good as the Samsung range the battery loose over 16% whilst your in bed the face Recognition\nIs not as good as Apple.",
            "Good phone only battery  don't hold long   nice color",
            "Got the new S20 5G 2 weeks ago, returning it today to EE as the battery is awful on it! My Huawei lasted 2 days, this phone barely got through a working day, I had 2 phone calls, checked some emails and whatsapp. Battery saver mode has to be on all the time! What is the point of having features and awesome screen/CPU etc if it constantly has to be on battery mode. Awful phone, I will be returning to my 2 year old Huawei until I find a phone that doesn't lose 2% every time I turn on Whatsapp.",
            "Best phone I have had so far. Love the size. Getting used to all the cool things to do on it",
            "Absolutely love this phone great colour and perfect picture quality",
            "Great phone at a good price I don't need 100mg camera 16 g ram I need this phone phone which works for me big HD screen good photos and too you Samsung good job",
            "Really really like this phone, I feel its a massive upgrade from my s9! The only thing I heard was negative about this phone was apparently it has a cheap feel on the back, that is so far from the truth, the phone feels great both performance and in aesthetics.",
            "All features are excellent\nOnly negative is no edge screen and heart rate sensors",
            "Always have Samsung phones, but this is awesome \nThought my S9+ was good.\nCamera on this spectacularly good\n*****",
            "I like the crisp clarity of the camera and the  seemless transition from old android to new. The only downside is the battery. As it stands I have to charge every day and my Battery is fully optimized. I also dont like that everything is now snapped up by samsung apps like browsers, email, cards all with non opt out legal requirements. Basically we are forced to hand over our privacy to samsung to have a fully fuctional experience. Also it doesnt came with headphones.",
            "Brilliant everything is excellent about it!! Love it",
            "Brilliant screen great to use just a little problem sometimes with the finger print sensor not recognising my print",
            "Not had an upgrade in a few years and to get this phone has blew me away its so fast and responsive love it.",
            "I love the camera the pictures are so incredibly clear! and I love how fast the phone is in general. bixby is quite helpful.\nit has a torch on as well which is going to come in very handy when the clocks go back :) I can't think of anything else to say.",
            "I've been using my cloud mint FE for around a week now, and have to say I'm very impressed with this device. I've really enjoyed the 120hz refresh rate and top notch camera. \nThe phone excells at media consumption with an excellent bright, colourfully large display.  The speakers in stereo mode provide impressive qaulity for the size of the device. \nThe back of the phone is a great material that makes me not want to use a case. The colour I have looks great in lots of different lighting. \nI don't think you can find a better phone with the same specs for this price. Samsung truly nailed the experience.",
            "Great camera,easy to operate and it seems a lot faster than s10 plus",
            "Absolutely love the phone, front and back camera are crisp and full of detail, battery life is surprisingly long and it runs fast. 5g is faster than my WiFi at home!",
            "I love my new phone  and its really  easy  to work and well designed",
            "Uograded from S9+. Not as big an improvement as I had hoped for and very over-sensitive screen despite adjusting settings.",
            "Good for games.\nIt is really smooth and reliable.\nIt really helped me.",
            "I've had Galaxy phones for years and dispite pressure from my son to switch to iPhone, I'm so glad I stayed with Samsung,  it's the best yet.",
            "Phone looks and feels great. System seems to run smoothly",
            "Terrible device for a premium price. Horrendous touchscreen problems, unresponsive. Don't purchase this product.",
            "Brilliant phone. It's quite large in size (I had the S9 before) but surprisingly light. The camera optics are brilliant and the speed of the phone very quick. Still finding new things out about it, but otherwise a very good phone!",
            "Everything is the right the security face recognition is fast the camera pics are splendid  its a great phone all round",
            "Sometimes it doesn't charge properly and sometimes it won't connect to my mobile data. It's really frustrating as I wanted to love the phone.\nWhen it works it's great, just what I wanted.",
            "Very comfortable in the hand. Very clear screen and for me wonderful photos.  Very pleased",
            "I haven't had a Samsung in two years wanting a different make of phone. I'm back and I love my s20 Fe 5g. By far the best phone I've had.",
            "Good phone good performance just Terrible that I don't have a any earphones im really disappointed with that for the amount I'm paying each month id recommend if had earphones",
            "I was worried the FE 5g would feel midrange, but the Snapdragon 865 is amazing, a big leap from my S9. The flat screen is actually better to use than the curved, and the battery life is incredible, even on 120hz. The cameras are incredible too, the live focus video has to be seen to be believed. Like most people, pets are my photography subject of choice, the zoom on this is brilliant too. Ironically the image files are too large to attach! Not surprised with the amount of detail captured!",
            "Purchased this to upgrade from the S10 lite. This is a much better phone but I am a bit disappointed with the battery life. The S10 lite was much better for this.",
            "Cracking phone for the money .\nFast,Great specs and great build quality.\nI prefer the plastic back ..it's lighter and shows less marks \nThe only niggle is the hit and miss fingerprint scanner.",
            "Nice little phone that packs a punch. Combined with xbox gaming. Not too heavy and has two sim card slots. Only main gripe is that the touchscreen seems to register random touches.",
            "Love the phone, battery life is way better than my old S0 plus due to the snapdragon chip, only thing I have noticed is the vibration motor isn't as strong as on my old S10 plus, everything else is better, especially the 120hz screen",
            "One of the best value for money phones out right now. Has everything anyone would ever need in a phone and is powerful enough to run anything. The battery is also a champ and will keep you going all day and long into the night",
            "Picture taken from new phone. Suppose its ok. Phone too expensive.\nOneplus a better deal now.",
            "The battery life is amazing especially since I'm coming from an s8. I would 100% reccomend this phone to anyone who is unsure on which phone to buy and one that doesn't break the bank.",
            "I don’t like your emojis, they are too different :(",
            "So happy with phone I upgraded from s9 plus wow amazing",
            "Amazing build. Amazing camera. Amazing battery life. Absolutely awful screen. Touches sometimes don't register, swiping is off and the whole experience is just awful. A friend of mine had exactly the same issue and Samsung haven't said anything about a fix. Likely will be returning phone.",
            "Ok i guess nothing to write home about.  Wouldn't reccomend it though",
            "The camera is totally amazing likes and the phone is brilliant",
            "Great sharp screen fast performance reasonable purchase price",
            "The phone is just as good as a s20 plus or even a note 20 brilliant camera and speed and just a brilliant phone I fully recommend",
            "I'm in the UK and this phone has the snapdragon 865. This processor is faster and more efficient than any other Samsung device on the market at this moment in time. So for less money I'm able to get an extremely powerful advice! Combined with the amazing screen and all day battery life... it's the perfect package.",
            "Possibly the best Samsung budget phone to date.",
            "Having had Samsung most of the time and upgrading to the latest model I thought I would be happy changing from my S8 to the S20 FE. Ohh boy am I wrong. The S20 FE looks good but thats about it... Compared to the S8, I don't even know I get notifications as dont have a flashy led light. The finger print scanner is very bad as doesn't even recognise my finger print compared to the S8 which unlocked it perfectly. Software is a little flawed as when turning from landscape to portrait it doesn't do it at times. Writing this review and the phone seems to freeze at times. The phone has no headphone port so always on BT headset which I don't mind wich takes me to the good points. The good points to the phone are that the battery life is very good and the camera is an improvement. But overall, I wouldn't  recommend this phone. I'd say spend the little extra money and go for the S20 or S20 Ultra.",
            "The site here states earphones in box for FE well that my friends is a lie.",
            "can't wait for it to get released! I know that it will be a good phone as all Samsung products are the best!",
            "wow the best phone ever seriously so convenient and versatile"
