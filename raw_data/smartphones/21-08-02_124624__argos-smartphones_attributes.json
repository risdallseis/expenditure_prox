            "I bought this phone about a month ago and I can say you get what you pay for.  The phone is slow sometimes and it's not easy to go from one tab to the other.  Nokia needs to step up the game. I have a Samsung phone and it is better than a Nokia as the features are easy to use and a user friendly phone.",
            "It is a very good phone especially for teenagers because has the features kids need also good for watching videos and downloading apps.

The screen is massive which is great for watching stuff, but this means the phone itself is quite large. If you have small hands are and prone to fumbling and dropping stuff (like me) you might want to choose a smaller option.",

Finger print open doesn't work 80% of the time. I use for delivery job and it froze in the middle of me trying to accept a delivery, hence loss of money as had to turn  off to get my delivery app working again which is when it took 10 mins to turn back on again. Hence lost out on at least 3 jobs in that time. Rubbish!",
            "This is a good strong phone resent model so quite new model l like Nokia always strong hardware  battery last two days with normal use very impressive. The only problem it doesn't have NFC which means you can't use contactless payment with Google pay l was little bit disappointed with that . Overall it's a good value phone l would recommend it.",
            "This phone is easy to use, I was sceptical about this phone as I use another brand, but its very much like the the brand I use, so I was able to navigate my way round it with ease. the App store has many applications to choose from and downloading them was easy as well. \nI love the colour fading at the back, it has finger and face recognition so safe and secure\nit held a charge for 8 days which is super impressive considering I have been playing with it most of those days.",

            "Very happy with this phone. For the price, it's a great deal, especially as they guarantee updates for 3 years. The phone does lag a tiny bit occasionally for example when it connects to a Bluetooth headset but it's only a few seconds. Screen size is great for watching videos, which the phone manages well. Camera lags a bit but I may look at tweaking the settings. Battery life is excellent.",
            "Good camera and lots of apps I find useful",
            "My phone was great, so easy to set up. Was up and running in half an hour, that's with updates. Would recommend this phone. Plus click and collect, was great, arrived at the store and back in my car in two minutes, keep up the good work.",

            "Great phone  easier to use",
            "Pre buying I found this model, despite not being most recent, to have the best reviews. \n\nOn receipt I was a little shocked at the large size of the phone in comparison to my old one , however I now see the advantages of having a larger screen.\n\nIt's function s are a little different for me e.g. a swipe on screen to return to previous page rather than a set button.\n\nThe in phone is pretty lightweight for its size, slimline and stylish. I love the great purple colour.",

If she is still stuck she can press the Google assistant button on the side and tell it what to do instead aswell as tell it to show her things on Google or play her songs.

It also misses out on a light (for example to indicate a message). It's also impossible to remove some google apps, and has a very irritating Google Assistant button on one edge of the phone which can't be disabled, and is easy to accidentally press many times a day. Other than that a good phone, especially supporting two SIMs and a memory card!",

I have never had an Android before and found this phone particularly un-user friendly, so much so that I was not sure it was working correctly so I returned it for a full refund.

            "Had to change from Windows to Android as lack of Apps on former including WhatsApp where the rest of my family reside.

            "This phone is a good value for money, we bought it for one of my grandparents who had a failing Nokia 7.1. This phone is a great alternative. The price does reflect the phone. It does have a nice finish and a good camera, but the only thing I can see with it that I'm not sure about is I have noticed there aren't as many apps available as there was on the Nokia 7.1. \n\nI would highly recommend this as a work phone. I was tempted to buy myself one!",

The MediaTek Helio P22 is a decent processer and coming from a Snapdragon 765G 5G processer it's not too noticeable thanks to the clean and smooth Stock Android & pack in the 2 years of security & software updates & excellent build quality it's the best £100 you could spend & this is coming from a man used to £600-1000 flagships. Great for parents & grandparents.",

But she now feels this phone is very useful whereas before she wouldn't see the point in having one. This ticks all the right boxes and a good choice of all the smart phones out their.

            "Very good for the price android 10 took a bit of getting used to",
            "The main reason I have given this an overall rating of 1 star is it is the slowest phonei Ive owned, the size is great, features are great but everything you press takes ages to react, if you want to take a photo quickly to catch a shot you will miss it, you end up pressing the button more than once as you think it's not working, the phone ends up doing whatever you wanted twice, the thing is a nightmare, I'm planning on sending both back as they are useless.",

            "I chose this phone for its price and large screen size of 6.5\" but it has some annoying traits. \n1) if you receive a call you have to unlock the phone to end the call when finished!\n2) On Bluetooth in the car, if you are taking a call and your kid presses eg Netflix, you then have both going off at the same time!\n3) To go back to front screen you have to swipe from the bottom but it will open other recent apps first so it takes several swipes!\n4) Fingerprint sensor doesn't work at all well !",
