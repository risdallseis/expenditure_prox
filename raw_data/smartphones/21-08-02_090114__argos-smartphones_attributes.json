            "U won't find a, better big phone for it price ever elsewhere!",
            "Although this phone is good in many respects, I am disappointed that it does not have a magnetometer fitted. I go hiking a lot and use several apps for location and their compass features. This phone cannot support any compass app and the description in the catalogue does not mention this shortcoming.",
            "I've had this phone a couple of weeks now and am delighted with it.  It's similar to operate to my G5 - but faster.",
            "I bought this product mouth ago and it's cover my needs easy to use long lasting battery great camera turbo fast charge and many Moore things",
            "I bought this product since it has big screen, nice specs and at a very affordable price..",
            "Bought this a few weeks ago and very happy with it",
            "Great deal for an Moto g9 phone. Best of the bunch of affordable phones. Great storage, lovely screen, decent camera",
            "Bought this phone to upgrade from earlier Moto. Well impressed with build and quality features.\nBest price from Argos.*****\nSix months interest free.*****",
            "The latest in a line of Moto phones we've bought, mainly for value for money, battery life and a clean Android system. This one fits the bill again.",
            "This has same fault as the G Pro\nThe camera when trying to do video at 60 FPS or slowmo\nThe focus pops. Unlike the G Pro from Motorola. You can't hear it doing it. But the more you move the camera or the filmed motion moves the more it does tiny like zooms in and out, as it tries to hold focus\n\nStay away from it.\n\nNice screen and loud but only one speaker\nWiFi is poor. When connecting it's very slow. If say I go from living room to toilet and I live in a bungalow. It wil move from one WiFi band to another as I have my separate. And takes an age to do.\nSo currently only now running on one frequency which does slow it down.",
            "I bought this phone to replace a Wiko. This one is way bigger but also has a lot of memory and power. I can finally download and use without crashing the Apps I need.",
            "Meets expectations - camera, battery, performance all good (the reasons I chose it). Screen is very big, so be prepared for that, and fingerprint sensor on the side takes a little while to get used to.",
            "Perfect for everything I want to do cannot fault it.",
            "Good phone value for money",
            "It's a big phone - possibly lethal in comabt - but everything works as expected and I'm impressed with the camera in particular. A lot cheaper than my previous Moto G5s Plus too. The maxim goes that the best camera you have is the one you have with you. I'm confident I can get as good snaps with the phone than I can I with my SLR; and I don't have to carry the big camera about.  This thing is in my pocket; a big pocket admittedly.",
            "Seems a good product. Good camera.  Great screen.  Plenty of memory.  Fair price",
            "Overall good and excellent battery life. But too many notification and always need restart ( basis of notification)",
            "Got my mine  a month ago, really pleased with it. Great camera. Great features",
            "Bought about two weeks ago and for a low (ish) budget phone it has lots of great features, particularly the camera. Music quality is good and it works well for all the things you'd expect. Time will tell how robust the build quality is, though there are no concerns.",
            "The Moto G9 plus is great value.",
            "had this phone a couple of weeks and so far its worked faultlessly good storage and very fast",
            "I was looking for;\n1. A great camera with high res, also with 4k video.\n2. Large screen (for easy on eyes text)\n3. Clear phone audio (both hearing and mic)\n4. Great battery life.\n5. Excellent value for money. IE not breaking the bank.\n\nI couldn't afford 5g, so 4g was fine.\n\nThe G9 plus is an amazing phone for the price and I highly recommend.",
            "This phone easily matches some of the top end phones in terms of features, but add in a battery that lasts over 2 days and considerably cheaper price point you've got a near perfect device.",
            "Bought as an upgrade from my wife's moto g9 play.\nGood phone and very nippy .\nReally good for watching catchup tv etc...\nTook her a while to get used to the fingerprint sensor being on the side but she wouldn't part with it now.",
            "Replacement for a damaged Motorola G8 Plus which I was impressed with. This model is even better. Would definitely recommend.",
            "The phone works well so far.  The battery maybe not as good as I expected. However enough to charge once a day. A bit heavy but the screen and keyboard is big so I can enjoy videos. \nPerfect phone for a middle budget",
            "Excellent phone and a great size. Battery life is also amazing with great storage. Just what I needed",
            "the phone came with out headphone in side the box . for me it's all okay  because i don't use them any way . But the phone is amazing with long life life battery and good camera.",
            "I Had an iPhone se 2020 model and was very disappointed with the battery life on it I would hardly use it but wouldn’t last the day so I bought the g9 plus I had not had a Motorola for years but always liked them and I have to say the battery life is superb I have used it as a sat nav spoken on several calls used the net and it was still on over 50% battery having used it all day the screen is nice and clear for the money this was half what I paid for the iPhone and am twice as pleased",
            "Brilliant phone great battery life with excellent features  for an affordable phone.",
            "This phone has great features and an impressive camera-delighted with it and would certainly recommend",
            "Really easy to use, quick and has an incredible camera and battery - one quick charge and it lasts for days!",
            "It won't let me tell you what I want to tell you without exceeding the maximum allowed characters, so for this very short review, it's a good phone. Don't be put off by all the review sites comparing these mid range budget phones with the flag ships. there are good things and bad, but nothing bad enough to make this short of being a great phone.",
            "Fantastic phone. Large clear screen, lightning fast scrolling with loads of memory, great camera and really easy set up from box. Thoroughly recommended.",
            "Great phone , worth every single penny, easy to use , excellent pictures and easy functions, battery last all day without charging. Highly recommended!!",
            "Brilliant picture, clear and nice screen, the camera is wonderful, syncs all google apps, making it so easy to use and it has an incredible battery life - lasts for days without charge. \nWould highly recommend - only thing is it is very large, I am a small woman with small hands so it is a bit bug for me, but I've gotten used to it (still fits in my motorbike jacket pocket especially designed for phones).",
            "Amazing phone!!!!Big screen,long battery life!!!!",
            "Arrived in perfect time and undamaged",
            "Overall it's an amazing higher end budget phone. \n\nHas all the features you'd expect from a much higher price model. \n\nCouple of crtisisms:\n1- it's screen size means it's incompatible with most 'universal' carriers. Great for viewing, not for moving. \n\n2- the screen sensitivity by default is quite high, takes some getting used to. \nMeans the gestures don't always work first time but getting better at it.",
            "Really nice budget phone great camera only giving 4 stars as no compass and no notification flashing alert as on previous phone but still would recomend as great storage space and even came with silicone case",
            "Excellent phone, after having used a different make phone for many years I am now converted to this one",
            "My kettle looks fab for the price. I like it",
            "Phone is OK although not outstandingly better than my previous Moto G7 Power. Battery life seems a bit disappointing, when using the screen the battery charge falls away in front of your eyes. Maybe I should have got a G9 Power....",
            "I love Motorola mobile phones. This is my third purchase and always 100% satisfied. I cannot recommend it enough.",
            "Fantastic phone does just about everything except make a cup of tea.  Cheap at twice the price.",
            "Another Motorola for me. More memory. Faster. Long warranty. Great price from Argos.",

            "Big phone, easy to use. Decent cameras. Big enough storage, dual SIM if you want or add an sd card. Quite happy withbit",
            "Independent reviews suggested this phone was top of the budget range in cost and quality for a sim-free mobile. Really pleased with the phone, particularly the battery life before re-charging. Downside is extra weight to accommodate the more powerful battery, but not an issue for me. Used my own PAYG sim card from EE. Easy to set up and transfer all data and apps from my old phone. Would recommend.",
            "My son needed a new phone and after comparing a few he chose this one.Plenty of storage and it has everything else he needs it for .",
            "As usual, my mum asked me for tech support and new phone recommendations. This is perfect for her. It's powerful without being over the time in terms of stats and features she'll never use. It's big enough that she won't lose it. Simple set up as well and a very reasonable price.",
            "Received it on time, a good customer service and it is better place to do shopping. Many thanks",
            "WOW what a fabulous phone, bought as a replacement to my samsung galaxy s8+, does everything and more!!\n\nVery happy with this purchase, battery life and turbo charging is excellent!!!",
            "The service was excellent, staff were helpful. Arrived when stated on text message. The phone is very good just as advertised",
            "Very good battery performance so far, couple of weeks performance. Different menus and settings then the other phones.\nAffordable price .\nPhone does not have front camera flash light ,if selfie taken in dark room.",
            "Can't really fault this phone. For it's price, you'd expect a lot less but I bought it for my wife and wanted at least 128 GB memory, a long lasting battery, and capacity for an SD card. It's great. Above expectations.",
            "Does what it says on the box and much more!\nStella battery life!\nCan not fault!",
            "I think all Motorola phones are very good value. The camera's very good on this one, the only thing I don't like as much is the fingerprint sensor on the side of the phone whereas before it was on the back - now it's not as easy to access but you get used to it.",
            "I chose the Moto G9 Plus due to the positive reviews it received for the camera and battery life in particular. It's a good budget phone all round and the battery only needs a recharge every couple of days (longer on occasions). It is a large and fairly heavy phone but I knew that would be the case.\n\nThe Argos price was very competitive, the website made it easy to order, the device arrived quickly (and on Easter Sunday evening too) and I was able to use and earn Nectar points. Very satisfied.",
            "It takes a little while to be able give a review as you learn something new every day, I've had the phone a little more than a week, there are still things that I haven't quite figured out yet but I'm sure that I will get there, apart from a few little niggles I have nothing but good to say, the camera is the best I have seen, the battery life is incredible, Moto claims that it lasts 2 days and it does, it fully charges in about one and a halt hours and there is no need to carry a power bank.",
            "Decent in all specs. Enough for your daily tasks. 4GB of RAM is the minimum you would need along with a respectable octa-core processor underneath a full HD screen.",
            "Another hit from Motorola, best quality-price ratio.",
            "I've had no signal problems and calls are clear which is important to me. Other than that it's plenty powerful enough for my needs, great screen, good camera, plenty of storage and battery life is excellent. It is a large chunky phone and heavier than usual so keep that in mind before buying. I certainly don't need the latest and greatest phone but for what you get I think this is a bargain at the price I paid. I had no problems ordering or collecting it. Good job Argos.",
            "Works well I'm happy",
            "Good size good camera easy to use battery lasts for ever",
            "This is a great budget phone to buy. Enough memory space and HD view. Playing games and watching movies on this phone is amazing, especially when you have a kid that has taken over the TV 24/7 and you can't afford another TV for now. The size of this phone helps me study without switching to laptop. The Google map is great too, but I wish it has compass. Overall, it's a good budget phone.",
            "Bought this as a replacement for my Moto g6 play which served me for 2.5years. Perfect upgrade, with the bigger memory, found my last one ran short of memory but was only 32gb compared to this 128gb so should be plenty. Glad I paid the bit extra for the plus version than the play as more memory and better camera. Don't buy from anywhere else, Argos service second to none, emailed ready for collection as soon as I paid. Well done Argos.",
            "Nice phone for its price.",
            "Charges very quickly (under an hour), charge lasts 2+ days, easy to use, good camera.",
            "After ten years of using the top line phones of the most popular android brand i was positively surprised. The phone is fully functional with v.good camera and amazing battery life. Every now and then needs a restart as it starts to work slower, but apart from that its been great so far. For the price its one of the best options there, it even comes with transparent silicone cover in the box!!! Also supports quick charge. Good stuff!",
            "Great mobile for no money. So cheap but with big batterie, the camera its very good .big screen come with case in the box. Highly recommend",
            "Does everything a phone should do b",
            "I love this phone, it's got such a good battery lasting me days (as a uni student I use it a lot), although this means the phone is quite large and bulky although I don't see a big screen as an issue personally.",
            "I love this phone! Can personalise so many features if you take the time to scrutinise the menus. Sound is loud enough (I like loud enough!), and can tweak bass treble etc to your preference.  Camera is good enough with lots of settings to tweak. Can get delivery reports for sms and mms, assign specific contacts personal tones for texts. Big screen... List is endless! Oh and the price? Amazing!",
            "my phone broke so i needed a new one! phone makes phone calls and as a bonus it sends texts! far as i am concerned it does its job!!\"!",

            "So broke the screen on my galaxy and needed a phone really quick. Checked Argos saw the 128 memory and had got feedup with Samsung ecosystem.\nSister said her old Moto had been good so being able to get it I instantly jump.\nAn excellent choice, the person who said the swipe off is different is spot on, but five minutes in and you forget.\nNo regrets",
            "Absolutely gorgeous phone and newest android software",
            "One of the best investments I have made. Great quality products as usual from Motorola",
            "Good quality for the price",
            "Can't really complain for its value my only grief  graphics would like higher better quality pixel density",
            "For the price this phone is excellent. I've been using it now for over two weeks, can't fault it. Large screen, but doesn't seem too big. Takes good photos. The battery life is amazing, it can easily get you through the day with plenty of charge and it charges really fast with its turbo charge. I'm surprised the phone is so good considering its classed as a budget device. It doesn't seem to lag, handles everything fine, if picky, face recognition doesn't work in poor lighting. Would recommend!",
            "This phone is well worth the money",
            "A quick mobile with plenty of storage, even though the mobile is big (which is great), still fits into my pocket. The mobile came with a basic phone cover which is a bonus along with the latest version of Andriod. Only taken a few pictures and videos so far but the quality is great, there are options for manual settings when taking photos too and all the usual modes for taking pics\nI'd highly recommend this phone, a great mobile for the price!",
            "It hes everything I require in a phone and more besides. It's easy to use the only thing is it's a bit big but then you get the screen size to compensate. Large screen and good colour not taken many pictures yet but what I have have been excellent. All round a good phone at a budget price.",
            "Fantastic phone great value for price , had Motorola's for the last 6years it wouldn't have anything else.",
            "Much good.Nice phone",
            "Doubtful at first because of the price but how wrong was I. its a great phone. Easy to import by contacts etc. The screen is great being big and am able to see it clearly.\nWould thoroughly recommend this phone.",
            "This phone really does tick all the boxes , great screen size , superb battery , quick response time. If had to criticize one thing it would be Motorola's Casting facility which can mainly only be used with a Chromecast, however if you have an app for the TV you are casting too you can get round it that way but only if you have downloaded your media.Screen quality is very good.Can't talk much about the camera as I only use basics.Has headphone jack and great stereo sound.",
            "Very nice phone and very reasonable price overall very happy with my purchase",
            "My daughter is very happy with this phone for doing school work and playing games, she likes the camera it takes great photo's.",
            "For a budget phone it works and performs well and comes with NFC. The battery lasted 2 days before needing to be charged.\nSlightly larger than im used to, but after a few days of use is hardly noticeable.\nFingerprint reader is conveniently located on the side.\nThe clear back cover was an unexpected bonus",
            "Large screen does everything I need it to do easy set up went back and got one for the wife well imprested",
            "WELL PLEASED WITH MY NEW PHONE GOOD PRICE GOOD SIZE TOO",
            "I'm normally a Samsung girl but couldn't afford a new one of those. But this to tide me over but do you know what. It's perfect it does exactly what I need it to do for a fraction of the cost. Only thing I don't like us it's not wireless charging but the battery last 5 days and charges in 30 mins. Winner winner",
            "A chunky monkey but really will go 3 days between charges with light / moderate use.",
            "It's very easy to use and amazing features!",
            "Good phone so far, been using it for a few weeks now. Nice big screen for seeing websites! Really easy to start up etc. Value for money.",
            "What a phone should of got one before now,best android phone I've owned by far,easy to use easy to set up, greatest pictures I've ever seen and taken, and the battery lasted near 3 days with out charging with using a good bit",
            "Great phone good value, Motorola is still the best mobile phone alrounder...",

            "A whopping phone with lots to learn , 4 cameras and more features , not quite as strong reception on the three network as my last phone , big storage memory and either a second sim or a memory card ( not both)  still experimenting with it",
            "I love it! Was weird getting used to not having arrows at the bottom to go back, you swipe instead. The staff were brilliant and let me pick up early as I was mid family emergency. The cameras brill and every thing works fast.",
            "wanted to upgrade my motorola and found a bargain at Argos and im very happy with the phone",
            "Great product worth the price would buy again",
            "It has a great HD screen and really good sound to it. Crisp pictures as well. Great value for money.",
            "A great phone and a good step up from my G6\nTook some time to get used to the different places for the buttons / fingerprint and also the gesture control - if you're used to swiping from the edges to move to a \"next\" thing you have to get the habit of swiping from the middle, as swiping from the edge counts as \"go back\"\nBattery life is great.",
            "The phone is brilliant. \nWorks fast, the battery and screen are great. \n\nCamera is also doing a fantastic job. Im a photographer and Im well pleased with the results, especially that I can take shots in RAW format. \nOcassionally Im playing games like RAID and they work just fine. \nThe charger included in the phone is also excellent. It can charge the phone in less that 50 minutes from 20 to 100 %\nThe loudspeaker is mono but the quality of the sound and ringtones is very good and loud.",
            "Bought this to replace a Samsung which had a very small memory. Took a while to learn to use, but much larger memory and works well",
            "I am from the Motorola generation and the name reminds me of the years 2001 to 2005. For the new model I was won over and I really appreciated the finish.",
            "Another excellent phone from Motorola battery lasts days well worth the money",
            "excellent mobile phone 64 mp camera like the range of photo modes",
            "Argos there when you need them just click an collect prefect",
            "I was looking a replacement for my galaxy A51 as it was laggy and slow, this device cost half the price and is much better at handling multitasking. The battery life is amazing two days battery life and pure android 10 can't recommend more.",
            "it is a great product and value for money",
            "Good phone for this price.Camera is good all software working with any delay \nFast reliable budget phone.",
            "It's first time I buy moto phone and it's really great phone high recommended",

            "Beautiful model. Absolute bargain",

            "This is a really good looking phone and does everything you could want it to.\nIt's quick to charge up, looks really good and easy to find your way around it. By far superior to any other phone I've had.",
            "I got this phone for a great price and it is definitely up there with the best on the market. I've had a few Motorola phone's over the year's but this one the best. It's a bargain for the price. Just be careful when ordering accessories because you have to be absolutely sure you've ordered for the correct phone. A plus and a play Motorola are completely different sizes. Apart from that. Ten out of ten Motorola!",
            "I'm a talented amateur photographer. Often I would miss great shots because I didn't have my SLR with me. This camera phone is amazing and the technology far supercedes my expectations for the budget I had.",
            "Very fast and does what I need it to do... Nice phone",

            "Good solid choice. I always get Motorola G family phones and haven't been disappointed yet.",
            "My last phone was a Motorola. i had it for 3 years. I was looking for Samsung. However, after reading reviews I was not impressed. Then I found this phone.\nPros - great front and back camera. Great battery life. I have an online business so I use my phone regularly and my battery life last at least 2 days. The phone takes 1 hour to fully charge. Perfect! \nCons- it's big and heavy. I can't use it with one hand. But I'm used to it and love it.",
            "Great phone, bought for son, he loves it",
            "Easy to Use with a Great Screen. Battery easily lasts all day",
            "Does everything I need it to do. One review from Caramac55 dated 5 January mentioned the absence of the home/back button. These can be activated as follows...Tap settings, then system, then gestures, then tap system navigation. You can now select 3-button navigation. Job done. Hope this helps anyone else with the same problem.",
            "Moto g9+ is a great phone. Have been Samsung user for years but this is much better option for a lot less money. Also could not find this particular phone anywhere else for Argos's price.",
            "I got this phone for my son. He said it's amazing. The battery last for ages. He plays games on it and still the charge lasts long. Amazing clarity of photos and videos. Will soon be buying an other one of this for myself as we are really impressed with it and it's features.",
            "I sent this back to argos it had issues with network connection recieveing call and texts also notification sound issues and photo issues \n\nDispite the disappointment with the phone argos was amazing and exchanged for a different model the same day I contacted them \nThank you to argos",
            "Just an excellent phone for such a reasonable price my only 1 thing that is a little bit on the negative side is the volume is a bit low but apart from that 10 out of 10.",
            "Nice phone what's buying.",
            "I have always purchased Motorola phones for last 10 years or so. Always happy with them. Lack of bloatware is excellent as you don't end up with loads of apps you never use. This Moto g9 plus is the best phone I have ever had. Large screen is a bonus",
            "As an upgrade phone I have not yet been able to see any reason to fault it yet. It's just v good for the price. It has everything a modern mobile phone should have. It's fast compared to my so so so slow honor 7s",
            "Buy if on tight budget but if not go for the ones in the market. Brand",
            "brought and paid for online for collection next day only to find that on the day of collection they had reduced it by£25 but hey ho still a good phone",
            "An excellent upgrade to my previous Moto g6. A very good screen, powerful processor and high capacity storage.",
            "This camera has an amazing macro and night vision camera. For normal pics the 64mp front camera is also stunning . My friend has bought a phone in excess of £600 and there is isint a huge amount of difference .. The 128gb internal memory is also very useful as  I use loads of apps. Having no home or back button is a massive benefit as you can click around so quickly not having to go to the phone Togo back .  Brilliant stuff",
            "Excellent phone and service.",
            "Always had Motorola's so bought this one as it looked good on paper, but think they've dropped a clanger with this one, No home/back button is infuriating, really infuriating, its a shame because the rest of the phone is very good, great camera and excellent battery life.",
            "great phone with good spec and good memory camera is fantastic the Mrs is well pleased with it.",
            "Fantastic phone Excellent working top Quality handset \nIf we compare waith samsung either batter or equivalent \nPrice small for this kind of phone  \n\nHighly recommended",
            "Was looking at this phone gor while as was upgrading from g6 play,so after about a month decided to buy ,only thing i was annoyed at is after a week price had dropped £25",
            "Its big and shiny and most importand battery lasted nearly 3 days while using it all the time. I  can't say the back is plastic , looks fab. Comes with a cover . Make very nice pictures and videos , easy to set up and use . My first motorolla and definitely not the last. Thank you Argos , it came extremely quick",
            "Even for an insanely heavy user, quite often achieve 2 days on one charge. Speech quality is good, main camera excellent, wide angle is ok but looks a bit processed. All in all very very good value",
            "Excellent mobile, has all the features anyone would need. Battery life and charge time are amazing. You could spend double and still not have the features and reliability of this model.",
            "Bought this as a replacement all I cam say so far so good, Easy to setup and user friendly. Only thing I don't like is the gestures I'm more of the 3 style button",
            "Faster than my previous g7 power, with same big battery. At last I can use my Moto for NFC payments. After first startup it tells you about new swiping controls instead of good old triangle circle and square. But no need to worry about it, you can just go to settings and disable the flipping thing with two or 3 taps if you want. The phone is only lacking 5g, but you can get by as this technology is still in it's infant stage.",
            "Very  good phone great  size battery  lasts  for ages fast processor  & 30 amp turbo charging . I've  had Motorola  for years excellent  choice  &always  found  them  to be reasonably  priced",
            "The phone is good, fast with big screen and Moto functions which are useful. Battery life is very good and bluetooth is work fine with the my car because my previous phones had a issues with connection. Only down side is the camera. I had Motorola one vision and camera was perfect but this one is without stabilizer and photos are poor quality. For cheap phone can expect more. No headset in the box.",
            "Usual Motorola business. Solid Android 10 performance and well worth every penny.",
            "Good value for price very happy",
            "Purchased this G9 plus a few weeks ago after my Samsung s7 edge finally died. Didn't what another contract phone and didn't to pay hundreds of pounds for a sim free. Well after seeing this Motorola G9 plus with all its brilliant specs I thought I would give it a go. Very happy with it so far and much better than expected. Would highly recommend. Great battery life and lag free performance. \nOnly problem is sometimes the SIM card can not be read. Maybe needs a clean.",
            "I bought this phone as I liked the look and spec of it,  firstly the food points:\nImpressive battery and quick charge \nCame with a silicon case\n\nThe Bad points:\nMediocre performance\nPoor signal indoors \nKept freezing\nNFC didn't work properly \n\nI accept that i had a faulty device, and Argos refunded promptly but after buying it I noticed a few reviews on the internet from people who ha shad similar issues with the same model handset - so buyers please be aware",

            "Highly recommended this phone. Great value & high quality. I have had the moto g phones for the last 8 years. They have never let me down. Can't fault them. Buy these phones with confidence.",
            "Motorola had always been a fifty-fifty to me when choosing a smartphone. But, to say I am 'pleased' with this handset would be a massive understatement! It has all the get up and go in style and good looks you need paired with outstanding memory, both RAM and ROM; lightning fast 2.2ghz processor speed; a powerful 5000mah battery; a huge, bright and clear 6.8\" display screen that is a pleasure to use with its impressive 64mp multi lens digital camera.\n10 out of 10 for this device - 1st class!",
            "screen cracked in three days, the support from Motorola was non existent, so opted to buy a rugged blackview off another platform solid phone no issues, only good thing about this phone is the battery.",
            "The only negative I would mention is the feel of the back of the phone (plastic). Much more preferred the feel of the metallic back of one of their previous phones. \nOther than that, it's an excellent value for money product.",
            "Released in Sept 2020 this is a excellent  mobile phone. A absolute bargain with Argos extra discount. A must have!",
            "This Moto G9 plus is a great phone, the battery life is awesome the first charge took only 45 minutes and lasted me 4 days and even then there was still 40% left.\nSetting it up was so simple and getting used to the different features was a doddle.\nAlso the cameras are wonderful I would recommend it to anyone..\nWell done Argos and Motorola!!",
            "Good price good style, excellent memory, good battery life",
            "Good mobile for the price",
            "This is a great phone. Has a fantastic camera turbo charge full charge in half hour. Lots of space for all my aps. Took me a while to get used to it. Had the g7 thought it would be the same just more updated. It isn't. I love it. Best phone I've had. Thank you.",
            "Top phone for fraction of the price",
            "Nice easy set up from an older phone. Excellent camera and has a long battery life. Comes with a screen protector and a resin case. Great value for money",
            "Well made product. Good value. Works very well in all aspects exctly as the description says.\n\nRecommended.",
            "Good value for money for a phone that has loads of features, a plus is the case that's included in the box.",
            "Being a pensioner I wanted a phone which was easy to use, with a great battery life.\n\nThis phone fits the bill with everything I needed",
            "I am really pleased with my purchase.  I upgraded from the moto g 6 so lots of nice new extras.  Great storage, Camera amazing, took a while to get use to the new swiping through the screens and side finger print and its a bit bigger than I am us too but not too big and bulky.  Great new addition to the Moto range definately recommend.  Great value for money too.",
            "Excellent value phone. Big, clear screen, easy to operate and switch over old data etc. Camera gives high quality pics although has too many operating modes for me. Comes in rubber case covering everything but the screen so the phone stays clean and is saved impact when dropped",
            "Bought to replace a g5 plus going progressively slower. I was concerned about the extra length, but this has not been a problem. It feels significantly heavier, though again not a major issue for me. overall it is great: fantastic memory, battery, camera. Android 10 good overall but swiping back can confuse within an app; and the Google assistant button was a real pain until I cut out the button cover on the aftermarket case which has stopped my accidental pressing.\nOverall very pleased",
            "Great phone, was a replacement for another android that lost battery life. This phone is a fab size, battery life amazing. Only issue is with casting to a TV through the wireless connection. It will not do this as it is not compatible with miracast. Motorola have taken this function away so to do this you need chromecast. This is not made clear in the description of the phone so if I had known this beforehand I would probably not have purchased. Other than this it is well worth the money.",
            "For the price it's a bargain does everything you need from a phone and the camera is excellent",
            "A big phone but so much better than my E 4 plus. No problems now two weeks in and still amazed at some of the pre installed apps allow me to do. Highly recommended",
