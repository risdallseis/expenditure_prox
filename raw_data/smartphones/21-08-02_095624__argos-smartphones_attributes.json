            "I bought this phone a month ago and absolutely love it. Its not much different from my s10. Only downside to the s21 there isn't a slot for extra storage",
            "I've not spent long enough with the phone yet to say how happy I am but I am really disappointed the phone doesn't come with a charger or headphones, or USB-C - headphone jack adapted. I've spent a very significant amount of money on a phone and now have to go and buy wires to make it work?\n\nOtherwise the styling and build quality are what you'd expect from a high-end Samsung phone.",
            "I'm with samusng since galaxy s3 and I have swap to s21 from s10 and I'm really disappointed as don't see any changes apart camera and refresh rate some things are even worse like screen resolution.  Don't get me wrong it is a decent phone but for a flagship series not really, very disappointed as if you look back into s20 s10 it's not worth the upgrade as you want see any difference apart the money you spend",
            "Not been with samsung for 5 years glad I switched back",
            "I have the Samsung 21 for 6 weeks , the camera is amazing and ease of features great. Love the colour but would like a new charger very disappointed that the expensive phone had no new charger.",
            "The camera on this phone is amazing but i should have said cameras cos there 5 i have one so i would defo recommend this to anyone think of purchasing one. STAY AWAY FROM IPHONE.",
            "Upgraded from the s10 to the s21 and tbf there isn't much change. The battery life is just as bad as the s10 after having that for over a year. S10 actually looks better than the s21 which is a shame, over priced phone that doesn't out do the old generation of phone",
            "The camera capturing real life moments in sharp and colourful images",
            "Works well hasn't gone wrong only thing is some apps are very slow to open. Otherwise it's perfect for everyday use.",
            "Got my new S21 5G yesterday but the battery seems to discharge much faster than my old S9.  Everything else is great but a big disappoinment re the battery on a phone less than 12 hours old.",
            "The phone is performing great, but I wish we could have the Snapdragon rather than the Exynos, other than that the phone is good for the price.",
            "Easy to use, big screen on a small phone.  Clear and great resolution.  Easy to use.",
            "So fast and great screen. Mine had problems with 2 SIMs trying to decide which to use to connect to my galaxy watch 3 and battery life could be better hence 4 rather than 5.",
            "Had Samsung phones for years, the S21 is notably slower than the S10, constant issues, freezes, very very slow camera start up, even struggles with Android Auto in the car. First time I have had to consider to Apple and will regrettably be moving after years on Samsung. Cheaped out on the processor, camera no better than the S10, not worth the upgrade at all, very disappointed.",
            "I'm all about practicality and if it's not broken then why fix it... why have you put the screenshot buttons on the same side of the phone? Need to use 2 hands now as my thumb can't manage it, I end up turning the volume down.  The other thing is the home button at the bottom of the phone, why does that not wake it up to use anymore? Need to use the side button.",
            "Phone performance overall is great apart from the struggle when taking photos with the 64Megapixel cam where sometimes it slows down while processing the image. Day time photos are amazing but can't say the same for low light indoor photos which aren't as good as you would expect. Battery life is okay.\nHaptic feedback is great which is very important to me as I am often on silent mode so good vibration motor is a must.",
            "I've changed from an s8 to the s21 \nThe screen colour is washed out. Doesn't matter if you choose vivid. \nBattery life is 18 hours from fully charged, I'd expect more from a 4000amp battery \nThe plastic back feel cheap \nIt still has bixby plugged in everywhere \n\nCamera is great",
            "Love the camera, great phone all round, must have!",
            "Love the camera, fab photos very clear. Its light in weight, thin in size. Really easy to use, it is a very practical phone",
            "Can't fault this phone so many features compared to an iPhone that I've previously owned. The camera is out of this world. Make sure you set it up properly and check all notifications properly while doing so as then you get the best experience out of the phone. Can't fault it!",
            "Been using it for almost 2 months, design is simple but very attractive. Screen resolution is topnotch and very responsive. \n\nFace recognition is bit slower.\nCamera focus is well in only certain zoom level and that too it differs in photo and portrait mode. And the portrait mode at 1x zoom is very blury and not good at all. Similarly in photo mode x0.5 zoom the focus is a let down, overall camera performance is very disappointing.",
            "I like the phone as its similar to the galaxy s range. Runs smoothly, apps work fine. Battery seems to last longer than the other galaxy range.",
            "Smooth operation. Extremely fast. Excellent camera. If I could change anything it would be to be able to colour code my events on my Calendar the was I could with the S9.",
            "This phone is amazing! It is much easier to use for me (66) to keep multi pages open..fab camera as all Samsung phones. I bet there are lots of additions I have not found yet! Sleek, chic colour what's not to like?",
            "Great phone but don't like the buttons all on one side",
            "Good phone with a couple of disappointing features like with all Samsung phones I've had before this is the battery life, to be honest I was expecting better. Previously I had the S3, S5 and S7 all had lower than expected battery life because of this I went to a Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the battery efficiency was night and day compared to Samsung. I chosen the S21 expecting it to at least be level especially with the new chip but it's not, even after 2 years the Huawei battery can outlast the S21 hence the 3 stars. Performance is great but clearly not an efficient phone when it comes to battery management unlike Huawei. \n\nThe other annoying features is Samsung preinstalling their own version of certain Google apps that you can't uninstall and will never use Please Samsung just stop ramming these down people's throats, it's getting old now.\n\nFeature wish and price point wise the S21 is brilliant apart from the above.",
            "The size is a big factor for me sick of big phones!!! Has all the features I need can't fault it.",
            "Phone good overall does what I need it to shame the battery life is awful can leave home for work on 100% get to work an hour later 55%",
            "There is a serious issue with the s21+ after 30/40 minutes the phone is so hot you can't hold it ..and it freezes . SAMSUNG sort this out before someone is serious hurt",
            "I love my new phone its lightweight easy to use, camera is brilliant the only thing I don't like is you can't download music tunes from deezer to put as ring tone apart from that I love my phone.",
            "For a device as expensive as this, you would expect an upgrade. My S10, hell even my S8 had not only a compatible headphone 3.5mm jack but it could read heartbeats through the IR sensors. Upping the price on a phone that has less features and that isn't much of a technical upgrade to previous models? Yikes. I do recommend it because it's a good enough phone, but a downgrade from previous models",
            "S20 seemed to run smoother especially during games this seems to lag during games and is unplayable",
            "I Love everything about the new.phone the  camera and editing features are so much better than any phone I've used before, the speed is impressive and loving the apps. Really Impressed with the Galaxy active 2 watch that I took out with the phone , really chuffed.",
            "I'm happy that I decided to purchase new Galaxy S21 5G. I'm using this phone over 3 months without any problems. All working good and smooth. I am happy with quality of photos taken by camera.",
            "The picture quality is fantastic but I still need to find out what the phone does in all haven't had much time",
            "The Galaxy S series just gets better and better, it does everything I need.",
            "short life battery ,  no earphones port. A bad buy.",
            "Great phone. Fast with the 120hz display.  Easy to use.",
            "Excellent phone! In love with the colour!",
            "great camera features fast and great interaction with other products",
            "Really annoys me that the ultra always comes in such bland dull colours and not the same colours as the S21 and s21+",
            "Upgraded from S20 to s21, massive improvement, screen is less than before but you can't notice. Everything else 100percent better. Plus it's price is amazing",
            "I have used S20 5G last year before upgrading to this new S21 5G. I have to admit that Samsungs decisions on design to make price cuts are to the point. For example I never used 1440p resolution on my older phone and plastic back never gave me a cheap feeling.\nThe processor or far more optimised and faster than before.\nThe camera is one of the best, if not the best, out there. Point and shoot always takes remarkable pictures.\nThe only gripe with this phone is it get a bit hot while doing things like video calls.\n\nOver all, this is an easy recommendation for anyone.",
            "Easy to use , fast and great amount , definitely order again samsung.",
            "I've just come from using an huawei p30 Pro, which I think was a much more of a good looking phone, it had a nice curved screen and a lovely blue alloy back cover also a 50x zoom camera it also was a lot more solid to hold,This new Samsung has a flat screen with I think is dated and also a plastic back cover wich gives it a cheap look.",
            "The camera is better than previous models. Other than that, there's absolutely no difference. Battery life is no better than previous model. Very disappointed considering the cost.",
            "Great phone, easy to use intuitive features absolutely love it",
            "Not what it's made out to be apps keep freezing or crashing",
            "I should have stuck with my S7+.\nI only upgraded because of the apparent camera quality. There's no difference between my S7+ & S21.\nMy partner brought the iPhone 12 mini at the same time & the quality compared to the S21 is incredible.\nI'm very disappointed.\nAs for everything else there is no difference between it & S7+.\nVery disappointed that the face recognition & finger print recognition are both rubbish & 99% of the time I have to use a pin. So really was no point upgrading.\nAgain compared to the iPhone mini it recognises my face straight away, I've never had an issue with the iPhone.\nJust a disappointing phone all round.\nMaybe I was hoping for too much but I thought there would be at least some improvements compared to a 5 year phone.",
            "Released too soon after s20. Slight difference. Not worth the extra",
            "I love thks device. Feels good in hand. Size is perfect. Camera quality is great. Back is made of plastic. But it doesn't really feels like plastic. But I think it would be great if it has glass back.",
            "Quicker than s8 just like it thake you  all good I have samsungs for years...take cares by...",
            "This phone is so fast and efficient. Battery life, charging, scrolling speed, exterior camera, customisation are excellent. Only flaws are social media related like using Snapchat and emoji. Other than that this phone is amazing",
            "It's very good phone with more features than other phones. Very good camera. Not happy with battery life. Should have been 4500 mAh instead of ૪૦૦૦.",
            "The phone is just basic and for the money I expect more than basic",
            "Good quality of pictures, sounds and camera and very light weight to carry on pocket \nAmazing",
            "I switched from the Note 8, it's slightly smaller but still a great phone. It's edge to edge screen is better, in my opinion, than the curved edge. The battery life is good as well.",
            "This phone constantly crashes. Samsung blame 3rd party apps, that come from the play store that they recommend. They say there's nothing wrong with it at all. It must be my imagination.\nTrying to speak with someone whose first language is English is near impossible. I'd leave well alone this is maybe my 6th samsung phone and unfortunately my last",
            "Nice compact sized phone works fantastic nice looking and sleek",
            "Very good device, a solid camera, display and battery life. Happy with my purchase",
            "This phone is great. It's smooth and responsive. \nCannot fault it except for the screen covering It's already peeling at the corner after 2 months.",
            "I bought samsung s21 5 G....but to my surprise  it was without charger an headphones ....and no free gift which was promised..very disgusting",
            "The phone is great, fast, good battery life and the features and Samsung community(1st time having a samsung) is great. Not 5 stars because I find that the face recognition is not as fast or accurate as other phones I have tried.",
            "Would like a pulse monitor on it.\nLove the colour and size.",
            "Quick processor,  nice looking phone, not too much different from my old s9, battery is OK expected it to last abit longer. Decent camera.",
            "My old phones battery and performance was awful and the phone got hot trying to do the simplest things. The S21 is such a jump up, it's amazing in every way and the battery easily lasts a day on normal usage. Couldn't recommend it enough",
            "Being an advid apple user for many years changing my my to a Samsung s21 was the the smartest move I've done ,just a wonderful phone",
            "The camera on this is so much better, the fingerprint sensor is so much more responsive and changing apps and websites are so much quicker.",
            "I like the overall look of the device. Performance is great too but the only issue is it heats up pretty quickly especially when you are using the camera, it doesn't take more than 5 minutes to become hot.",
            "The phone looks good but battery life a little disappointing.",
            "Excellent camera quality, lovely design, quick speed, just an overall good phone. Only criticism is the battery runs out a bit too quickly.",
            "Samsung have not come a long way. In 4 years, the phone has become bulkier, the wireless charge doesn't work very well and it takes at least 3 attempts of my fingerprint to unlock the phone. Bring back tye S7, it was far better. Phones like the S21 put me off buying Samsung again.\nVery disappointed.",
            "Nice phone. Missed the bit about no SD card which was a differentiator between Samsung and iPhone.",
            "I dont like it it looks very very  similar with s20 and s10",
            "I am liking the fact that the curved screens are gone. The back being plastic isn't an issue either. Amazing screen,sound and speed. Only downside is that I have had it freeze a few times and had to try and restart. After a couple of attempts it normally restarts and is fine for quite a while. Holds its battery charge well. \nAll in all another excellent device from Samsung",
            "Perfect camera, crystal clear, really lightweight, speakers are crisp, loud and clear.\n\nI love it,",
            "Very happy with the S21 5G\nIt's fast and very smooth\nAlso we'll built its a solid phone",
            "Excellent phone love it lots new things like 5g just shame it's not in my area at the moment but best Samsung I have had had S8 S9 Still got it but this is better love camera settings and features feels and looks much better feels lighter than S9 don't know if it is not looked but feels like it is",
            "Moving up from the A70 to this was a big step, even though I loved the A70. This just has all the things I used and enjoyed about that phone but better and quicker.\nLove how I don't have to worry about anything working. It all just does. All apps, websites, accessories work a treat with no problems.\nSound and picture quality are fantastic.\nPerformance when doing anything is amazing.\nLove my new device.\nOnly one hiccup so far but I'm sure this will be resolved with a future software update. I get a notable lag on the camera when taking pictures but not so bad that it causes me to worry or make it unusable.\nAlso wish they had left the expandable storage as this was a major bonus on my previous device. But I suppose with all the other upgrades I get with the s21, I can't have everything.\nGreat phone, easy to use and I would recommend to anyone looking for a flagship.\nGreat support from Samsung too if needed. Happy customer all round.",
            "My new Galaxy S21 has surpassed my expectations for it's processing speed and smooth handling. Despite loosing a few features from my previous S9 the bigger screen and battery make this a very good home/work phone. Very impressed overall",
            "Had it just over a month grand phone for the money there's only one thing I miss 1440p display",
            "Samsung phones are simple to use anyway and this did not disapppint me either. Bought it for work purposes amd it does a good job as expected. The colour is a pretty purple and matches the pic!",
            "So far I do like the phone, I do find it a bit strange it does come with a charger.",
            "After moving to iphone for several years, I switched back to Android a little over 2 years ago, and haven't looked back since, I've always had Samasing as my first choice on android devices ever since way back before flip and slider phones, and they haven't failed to amaze me since.\nThe S21 has been a fantastic addition to the Samsung family, with fantastic speeds, the ability to handle vigorous usage and still returning great battery life, as well as never faltering or lagging, or really any kind of signs that the phone is unable to keep up. Recording and pictures are exceptionally great, whilst basic functions as always are always easy to navigate.\n\nOverall I'm glad to of upgraded to the S21, and would highly recommend it to anyone",
            "Very happy with  my phone shame my gear 360 not compatible with it but let's hope they sort it soon .",
            "I've not had a Samsung for about 7-8 years due to the experience I had with my last one but the S21 is a fast and brilliant bit of tech.",
            "Really love it. \nBest phone ever! Did a good job to keep using Galaxy instead of switching off to iPhone!\nSo pretty and amazing features.",
            "Taking put audio-jack and SD card slot and going silent or under the radar with it something not very pleasant for the Samsung community. Now I'm forced to buy wireless audio devices which doesn't provide the greatest connnectivity and audio quality...I'm forced into bying services such as clour or phone upgrades when I run out of storage room? Consumerism at it's best: connectivity in exchange for flexibility, service quality... Life-time loyalty is a bad deal for Samsung.",
            "The device is great but cannot order my free buds on line as doesn't recognise my imie number. Also every phone number I've been given is wrong or no longer active",
            "I don't know what the fuss was about the Samsumg S21. There is nothing spectacular about this device.  Not different to other Samsung devices.",
            "The camera on the S21 is just fantastic  and the screen resolution is great",
            "I'm still learning many of the features and options of the S21. So far, so excellent, wow what a great phone with a superb camera and a very clear display.",
            "Absolutely love this device. Decided on a s21 as opposed to a new Xperia, first time in 10 years, love the features, the fonts, camera is SUPERB. Only issue I have is the sometimes unreliable wireless charging, and the lack of a 3.5mm jack.",
            "Samsung S21 5G  no screen protection out of the box , really disappointing finding minor scratches on screen after walking to work with phone in my pocket, screen very fragile.",
            "the phone is very good, looks impeccable, the order came very quickly. thanks argos for the help",
            "Appears to work well but not sure if there's an difference with my previous S10+. I'm still discovering its potential. I was not happy for excluding the memory slot because it limits options. Not everyone likes cloud memory for fear of losing it or possibility of it being stolen. Overall it does the job as expected.",
            "Cracking phone everything  gyou need in a device bes thing about it has to be the camera",
            "The touchscreen for fingerprint recognition is very temperamental \nOften does not work and have to use my pass code\nI prefer Google pay to Samsung pay too",
            "Upgraded my galaxy plus 10 for this pointless s21. No headphone jack and still waiting for live buds...its been 4 weeks and counting! Oh and you cannot insert additional storage card. You would have to choose the phone with larger capacity meaning it cost more, I should've read the reviews before I jumped on to the ice! Face palm emoji",
            "Really coming to grips with the new Samsung S21 and still cannot believe the price. Everything about this phone feels modern and stylish, as well as raising the bar compared to it's market rival's.",
            "The camera on the s21 is awesome I love it pluss has so much memory and there is loads of other cool apps to play with",
            "So happy with this phone. Upgraded from the s10 which was also a fantastic phone. However the s21 feels smoother to operate and is faster. camera is brilliant",
            "I got the Samsung galaxy s21 5g bout 3 weeks ago nd have nothing but problems with it.  Shocking battery life, constantly freezing, the camera freezes, you have to restart the phone to turn the volume up.   I used a huaweip20 mate pro  before this for 2/3 years and that phone is still far better than this piece of junk I'm using now.  \n\nIf you're thinking of buying on, DONT.",
            "I upgraded to the new S21 from my previous long-lived S8 which I loved. Its a much heavier phone but obviously extra components, a slightly bigger screen and far, far superior battery made me expect that. Functionality is very similar but frequent misplaced letters when typing which has never been an issue before. Also had a few occasions where an incoming call cannot be answered as the swipe on the screen would not work. \nI understand the move to wireless connections but still feel a jack for headphones would have been nice, even if only for occasional use. I feel when you are charging what Samsung are for their galaxy buds it effectively increases the cost of the phone (my buds were free in an offer but my partners were not). \nLooks and feel is great, as ever. Slight bugs at the start which I hope will be resolved in updates soon. Fantastic camera, needs work on signal retention but some of that may be my carrier. Plenty of capabilities for what I want. I just feel I was expecting a bit more than I've got for the cost. Feels very much like a very small boost on my S8, rather than multiple generations later jump I thought I'd get. Still like it though. Great phone",
            "Samsung galaxy s21 5g\nThis phone is great, simple to use. The camera is amazing. can't rate this phone enough",
            "Great phone, as expected. Although not radically different from S10",
            "Absolutely brilliant glad I went back to a Samsung not changing to any other phone from now on. Feature are quick and fast.",
            "Nearly sent phone back due to it overheating but that was only for the first couple of hours new phone and transferring everything over. The phone is really easy to use only negative I have is the battery life its not as good as my old phone.",
            "I need say nothing go buy the ultra you WILL NOT REGRET IT !!!!",
            "This phone really does blow every competitor away by some length.\nI'm a photographer and the quality and features of the camera are outstanding - well ahead of the obvious competitor!\nThe battery is also phenomenal. I'm regularly getting between 36 480 hours on a single charge even when photo editing.\nWhy am I not rating it 5 star?\nSimply because Samsung have produced a high quality (and cost) phone then removed elements like charger, headphone jack and heart rate monitor.\nSamsung, you're better than THAT other lot, just let the phone quality speak for itself",
            "10X better then my s10 plus just made things easyer to uses and much quicker processor power \nAwesome with the xbox razer pad",
            "Phone feels very similar to the S10 galaxy, no massive difference. Price is still high but, worse this time they don't provide you with any head phones, charging wire or adapter. There is no longer an AUX port and you are not provided with a conversion cable. I complained about the lack of compatibility with the wire given and the old adapters making charging difficult and the fact that i have newly installed USB port wall sockets which are no longer relevent to use. Disappointing.",
            "If you want to be constantly connected to a charger then this phone is for you, doesnt last all day, no where near. The camera is of good quality. But compared to other andrioid devices it doenst stand out as much as they used to. The market is definitly narrowing on samsung",
            "Bought a new S21 on the deal with free galaxy buds. \nPhone meets my expectations, a few little quirks that I had to get familiar with but overall a good experience. At the same time I bought the Samsung LED View Cover. It's a good cover for protecting the phone, great idea to put a card slot on the inside, it now leaves me somewhere safe to carry my card without carrying my wallet. However,  the LED function is just a gimmick and rediculously expensive for what you get. LED display only shows for a very short period of time and is pretty pointless. You can create a LED image for your contacts or create your own. The create your own facility is piintless, it's basic and just about impossible to write / draw anything clearly. Theres a nice LED clock which shows when you close the cover but this goes off aftet a few seconds. If you want to see the time you have to open the case to activate it so you may aswell look at the screen, I'd suggest you buy a far cheaper alternative.\nCamera is pretty good but theres not a simple Macro operation specific for close ups, you use an associated setting that dosent work well at all. Regarding tbe battery although a greater capacity than my S8, I haven't noticed much of a distance.\n\nOverall a great phone and camera, buds are great but stay away from the gimick cases!",
            "I had a huwaui before this and a Samsung before that. I was dying to get back to a Samsung. So much happier now",
            "I love my S21 5g, it's the best phone ever without taking up too much pocket size, small powerful and packed with features which last all day, well done Samung",
            "S21 is alright so far... the video quality is OK but I cannot find the slow mo camera mode and Is there any way of making gallery folders password secure so that you don't have to compress them??",
            "The vibrant display..the crisp sounds off the speaker..very fast phone..easy to use definitely a 5 outta 5..missed so many other factors as to why its such a good phone",

            "Samsung galaxy s21 5G is great phone the camera is brilliant and the screen resolution is better than my samsung series tv.",
            "I really like the new design on the cameras and back panel. Even tho I really miss the curved screen from the S10 and I felt like I made a mistake choosing s21 instead of the s20.\nThis phone feels like a space filler between 2 awesome phones. But oh well it comes with free ear buds which I had to apply for, and still waiting for it to arrive..... why couldn't they just include it in the box.... oh yeah follow looser Apple with their chargerless slim box.... \nAll in all I can't wait my 2 years to finish so I can be able to upgrade my phone again to something better IF Samsung decides to make better phones in the future. And I'm not talking about the foldable rubbish",
            "The phone is great I love everything about it apart from the battery am not impressed with it",
            "I've just upgraded both my phone and my missus' to new S21 5G's and I honestly have to say that we're impressed!  We play games for hours, go out for walks and take photos and still have enough battery to last out the rest of the day with plenty of web browsing.  \n\nThe only thing I really miss is my heart rate sensor but I can't stand wearing a watch.  I might give one of the new Galaxy Watch Active a spin but I wouldn't want to splash out hundreds just to find it uncomfortable.\n\nThe camera is great and Single Take is fantastic.  Shoot a video for a few seconds and you get mini video clips, loops suitable for uploading on to social media and photos in a range of sizes and filters. \n\nOver all we're happy customers.",
            "I absolutely love it! It's fast and easy to use and the battery life is amazing. Only thing I would say is they need to make jeans with bigger pockets to fit it in !",
            "It's fast light and battery lasts a long time even when gaming the batter last very long time on a charge, my other u played for a hour batter needed charging not the s21 keeps going and going on one charge.",
            "love the phone and all the things you can do lot of memorry too well worth it",
            "I've upgraded from the S8, so was a bit hesitant at losing the curved edge but honestly its not detracted at all. The screen quality is still fantastic, and watching films look incredibly bright and vivid. \nCamera is superb, and 4k video recording is great. The image stabilisation feature is a new addition but really brings your videos to life. Can see this being super helpful for those that do content creation. \n\nI'm so happy I took the plunge and bought it outright, was about time! If your thinking of buying, make use of the 14 day cooling off period and keep all boxes, packaging etc.",
            "I upgraded from S10+ and didn't consider the battery. Having used it for a few weeks, I found it simply wasn't good enough for my demands.  \nI love all other aspects of the phone so I have now replaced it with S21+.",
            "Ok,  over priced as usual for phones these days\nLike every phone now, glorified camera",
            "love Samsung tech only downside of s21 5g no memory card slot and no headphone socket",
            "This Samsung Galaxy S21 doesn't seem any faster than my S10",
            "Phone is great. Battery life is amazing. Performance outstanding. Cannot fault it one bit.",
            "Overall I find the S21 to be a great phone, it just lacks some features I've been used to.  For example there's no expandable memory slot, headphone socket or notification indicator light.  However I guess this is the way phones will be going in the future and it's just a matter of getting used to new ways of working.  I understand some of those features may be available on the Ultra version, but that's way beyond my price range.  I'm very happy with my phone though and would have no hesitation in recommending it.  Samsung quality is always excellent in my experience and the S21 is no different.",
            "It's fast , but too many times I. Having to restart the phone as some apps won't respond sometimes,  its starting to really get me annoyed .",
            "I was concerned I shouldn't purchase the s21 as an upgrade to the S20, but it's so much better an experience than the S20 was from the S10. The camera is a dream to use now,  love the distance stabilisation.",
            "I got the S21 as an early upgrade offer. I have to say that although it's a decent phone I'm not that impressed. \nStraight out of the box and you're doing stuff to make it run better. And not much of that works. In all honesty I'd easily have my Note 10 back. \nI've tried gaming on this phone but there is so much lag. \nAnd no matter what you do, the battery life isn't that great. To get anything close to a full day you need to compromise on so much. \nNot my favourite phone by Samsung.",
            "Screen, battery and speed are all an upgrade from Note 9. Getting used to hole punch camera, does spoil the impact of the display a bit. 120hz a surprisingly big difference to how things look. Software is amazing so to hear that 4yrs of updates from Samsung is a big deal. This is going to be hard to top",
            "I recently brought the new galaxy S21 and have had it for a couple of weeks now thinking the issues I've been having will improve in updates but they seem to not work. The issues I am having are that the phone will randomly restart multiple times randomly throughout the day, I have not had a day where it would not restart at somepoint. I have tried downloading the latest update but it gets to 25/26% before it errors and restarts without installing.",
            "Samsung S21 battery life is a joke, even with Power Saving mode activated and Enhanced Processing deactivated.",
            "I have had several Galaxy S phones, an S5, an s7, an S8 and now the 21. Throughout these iterations the model has had features stripped away. First the S6 lost the IR blaster and swappable battery, the S21 has done away with the infinity screen, glass body, mini jack, heart rate sensor, and even a mains charger in a desperate attempt to compete with the new wave of budget flagships from China.\n\nThis is a shame. I miss flagships that were tech powerhouses and let you do things that were borderline Star Trek technology.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it isn't a bad phone, just another average flagship in a sea of mediocrity. On the plus side the camera is very good. Were it not for that, this would likely be the last Samsung Galaxy S that I would buy for myself.",
            "I bought this phone because i had high hopes for the camera. The selfie camera first made very white washed pictures but the clarity was good. Now i was sent a software to update and the whitewash has been made better but the clarity of the selfie has become worse. Could this be sorted?",
            "It's a nice phone I don't even mind the plastic back and the new exonox chip is much better than the one that was in my s10 this new chip doesn't heat up the phone like the s10 .",
            "Ok camera alright but not great lots of photos out of focus",
            "The Samsung S21 is brilliant. Everything runs so smoothly and the camera is excellent. I love that you can take photos in 8k.",
            "Pre-order the phone, get delivered but i was the unlucky person because battery could barely hold charge for 4h. WFH and being on the zoom calls for upto 5h a days due that battery was dying on me every 4h. Cut the story s21 5g got battery issue. Phone have to charge 3 x time to go through a day. Disappointed samsung should have read the current situation where people are more dependent on the phone to work from home. Make the phone with battery to last long. What is the point of focusing on the camera where some of us locked inside the house. S21 5G could have been a better device if it has a decent battery.",
            "The phone is OK, style is nice and I quite like it but there are two things that have put me off, first is why the phone costs so much when you don't get anything in the box with it like no charger or ear phones, second I saw that it's scratch resistance when I brought the phone and my phone was in my pocket by itself when I took it out and saw there was a scratch.. so scratches so easy by the looks of it... disappointed",
            "My s9+ is miles better no memory card slot fingerprint scanner poor hate this phone.",
            "I don't love it. Unfortunately I've went from an s20+ to the s21 and dont see any improvements \nCamera same quality \nScreen same quality\nPhone calls dont work properly connection issues",
            "There are a few things I am disappointed with the first is the removal of the additional memory slot. The second is that I have had a galaxy S5 right up to the S21 and this screen is not as tough as previous screens to easy to scratch.",
            "Stepped up from an s8 phone which was a great phone  to another gret phone  more features  that I really have not used to full extent  yet but overall very happy  with the phone the battery lasts about a full 24hr on normal  use",
            "The phone is great, run fast and smoothly, amazing camera. Very happy with it.",
            "I am amazed at both the appearance and internal features of this phone! 8gb Ram is a great processor with incredible speed! The photo quality, clarity of pictures are phenomenal. Previously I was impressed with the Note 10 I had prior to this purchase.\n\nSamsung; you certainly never fail to impress. I am a very proud customer,  and I am forever grateful for your wonderful devices!",
            "Love the phone taken some getting used too as the last phone I had was the Huawei p30 Pro must say still struggling to match the camera on my old phone other than that phone seems pretty decent",
            "Phone itself is pretty.\nPerformance is very lacking. Unable to perform multiple things without overheating. Received this notification twice. During covid I use messenger to video chat with my partner and if I do anything other than this, the phone will overheat. I have games on my phone that don't show up only in games launcher,which I found bizarre. Battery isn't brilliant, but it does charge quickly.",
            "I love the size of the phone i was so sick of phones getting bigger and bigger this phone is the perfect size, it has speed and good storage with it too i love it and would highly recomend it seriously, design is good to it really is grate, no down falls at all",
            "I love the phone but the first day i had it in a pocket with a lighter, which managed to put deep noticeable scratches into the phone",
            "Loving the new camera pictures so sharp and crisp, bringing the colours to life. All the usual functions with 5G thrown in.",
            "Such a pretty phone! I bought the lilac one. This is my first Samsung and I love it! All the features are great. The camera is one of the best in the market,selfies or normal camera are really good. Definitely recommend this phone. I received the earbuds with it and i been using them since I received them. Great quality.I wouldn't mind if they were a bit smaller lol",
            "I just love it all I had the s10 before and I thought that was good but this s215g is better faster and liter",
            "Huge Samsung fan. Adore my tablet & S pen. Loved my S9.\nThis is just terrible. Just purchased & hate it. No benefits over a very cheap phone and it's not a cheap phone.  Lacks wow factor. Feel mean posting negatives for one of my favourite tech companies, but this has missed every mark.",
            "Didn't think I would get on with a bigger screen but love it. It's so crisp. It's speedy doing tasks, trying to work out camera setting still but nice device so far.",
            "I upgraded my phone because I wanted a better camera to have with me at all times. Really pleased with it so far although I’ve not tried all the options. The telephoto is useful and the colours are great.",
            "The phone works great but the battery does not last a full day with moderate use",
            "It does what it says. It's a mobile. It would have got 5 stars but doesn't have a headphone socket. Not everybody wants to use earbuds!",
            "I upgraded from S9 to S21, its got great features and amazing camera, recommended.",
            "Ideal little phone, not as powerful as I'd hoped after coming from the Note 9 and has issues with maintaining its display when too many apps are open and I hate the keyboard. Visually displays are stunning, response times are good, camera works well. Although next time I think waiting and being able to get the ultra style version at a reasonable price would be a better idea for what I want my phone to do. Ideally this is a phone for basic users not those who are used to higher end performance.",
            "Excellent quality very sleek and great features only down side it don't come with a charger only cable",
            "Love the phone and comes with screen protector on it very fast compared to the s9 I had amazing pictures not to pricey I just love it",
            "disappointed that it doesn't have wi-fi calling option and that comes with no headphones.",
            "Great phone very fast Tempted to get 21 ultra though",
            "Been using Samsung for last few years for phones, S7, S9 then note 9. This is a somewhat reluctant upgrade as I wasn't keen on losing sd card support and headphone jack. No regrets from upgrade, I like smaller phone body. Don't miss loss of QHD display as never used this on note or S phones. Love variable 120hz refresh makes everything seem slicker and faster. The screen is truly edge to edge now, looks fantastic and now it's flat, so no accidental touches when you grip it. * mine came with preapplied screen protector* it still  has dual sim, split screen and one ui which is updated like android 11. Dex is such a bonus now it can be used over wifi, your smart TV can now be a pc and all your function on a larger screen. Get it while there are free Bluetooth buds live as these are so comfortable for long listening sessions. There are cheaper android phones but none as feature packed and good value as the 'vanilla' s21",
            "Loving it so far, new features still yet to discover. The camera is incredible and the quality of the phone is very much a huge upgrade to my previous smartphone. Plus the phantom violet doesn't get any less beautiful every time you see it.",
            "Everything about this phone is great, the camera quality etc is even better than before.",
            "S20 and S21 one next the other still S20 have a nicer display, plastic on the back on S21 feel cheap, camera seems to make better one shoot pictures but the little extra battery and missing features when compared with the S20 completely distroying the experience",
            "I have changed from an S8 to the S21 and I must say that I am a little disappointed. The phone does not come with Samsungs flagship SD card port, meaning that when I transferred all my docs, the phone memory was nearly full. If I'd have know this beforehand I would have ordered the bigger memory. Instead I am now expected to pay a monthly subscription for cloud storage. No charger plug came with the phone, again disappointing as I now have to use my old charger cable as I do not have a plug that supports the new cable. It's a shame that everything that Samsung slated Apple for, they have now done themselves.",
            "Beautiful phone and brilliant camera  and it's also lightweight .  However, for me the only downside is the fingerprint facility as  this function does not work when there is a glass screen protector, this is a let down.",

            "The phone and its features are great! i fully support not providing a charger, but many people my have upgraded from an older phone such as the Galaxy S9 like myself would have found it better to have a usb - usb-c cable instead, or have an adaptor provided for the usb c cable provided, to be able to connect to a usb charger? And also maybe an adaptor to fit a 3/4 jack headphones to the usb-c adaptor too? The lack of these brought the value down a bit for me im afraid...",
            "I was extremely excited to get this phone as an upgrade from the S10 - once received, I realized the screen resolution was a downgrade from the S10, the 5G was slow (using same carrier), NFC payments worked in only 1 location whereas the S10 all locations I shop. The on screen fingerprint reader is placed to high, etc. I have since returned this phone and went back to my S10.",
            "Love my new phone loving the purple and the rose gold",
            "The plastic back Is the main let down of this phone, I have to ask why Samsung would you do this? The S10 feels better to hold for this reason alone. But if we can ignore the plastic back it is a fair upgrade from the S10, it's quicker overall. If it had the glass ba k I'd have gave it 5 stars",
            "Been with Samsung a while now. Upgraded to S21 and the speed of this phone is second to none. Camera is good quality and it feels good in your hand, couldn't fault it! Only issue is no expandable memory...",
            "Im loving the phone so far , seems alot smoother to operate than my previous s20. And feels better to hold, i found the previous glass backs a bit poor , been with Samsung since the s7 , all good phones",

            "I picked up the S21 I pre-ordered yesterday.  All of my old music files are not playable on this phone.  I do not like the buttons all on the same side, it is awkward.  In general I upgraded to get a poor experience.  I have been a Galaxy S Series owner since the 4 and this will probably be the last one.  I will probably with to an IPhone after this.",

After 24 hours I'm already use to the s21.\nOnly downside was because the cable for charging is usb-c on both sides I had to go and buy an adapter to change it to normal USB one side to use my USB plugs. Should come with an option to get a plug or not for people who have had different phones or older phones with a different connection. \nOver all great phone, easy to use and lightweight. Love the purple too",
            "I just upgrade my Samsung a41 for s21 so far it OK. I am not worry about a charger come with it and you can change the setting for turning of the phone.",
            "S10 was better. No charger, Cable is different, Fingerprint recognition further up the screen, To turn the phone off you have to press volume key and power button so you will take quite a few screenshots in the process. Should have just stuck with an older version.",
            "Got the S21 a day early with all the preorder bonuses and I'm throughly impressed. The 120hz makes a massive difference, especially when playing games. The camera quality is great, the colours are rich and vibrant and it's quick enough to capture my fast moving 8 month old. I got the phantom pink version and it's gorgeous though the metal around the camera and side of the phone is a very pink hue bot the rose gold/bronze tone that it looks like in the promotional photos. Overall very happy."
