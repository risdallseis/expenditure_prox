            "Was indeed of an upgrade from a Note 4, so researched what would be a good 'fit for purpose model' that wasn't too big, wouldn't break the bank yet has a decent sized screen. The S9 seemed to fit the bill and, having used the phone for a month now, I can report that it does fit the bill.  It has the usual Galaxy S features, is light-weight and stylish.  I purchased a case for added protection.  It's shiny and slippy so worth investing a few extra pounds to protect the device.",
