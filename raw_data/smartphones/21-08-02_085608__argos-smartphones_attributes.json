            "Works brilliant good picture quality and easy to use",
            "I'm an IT specialist by trade & am suitably impressed not only with this smartphone, but with TCL as a manufacturer in general. After extensive research I decided to purchase this 'lite' version of the TCL 10 mobile phone as it is of very high specification & 'punches well above it's weight' when compared to more expensive alternatives from the established electronics companies. I received an android 11 system update within 12 hours of activation, making the UI state of the art. buy this phone!",
            "The phone itself is great value for money, fast enough for the price and a nice screen.",
            "Really pleased with the purchase so far as I was switching from an i-phone and found the process seamless. Great that it has the latest operating system.  Would definitely recommend it for the price and features for somebody who is not a heavy user",
            "Very good phone doesn't run slow for the price it's excellent",
            "Price is a bit high for this phone. Battery is not lasting long. Good service from Argos.",
            "Really good phone \nWorth the money",

            "Great spec and easy to use.",
            "The battery life is good, the quick charge feature is really helpful. I bought this for its amazing storage and duel SIM.",

            "This is a great budget phone for price. Storage and r excellent. TCL an upcoming brand that gives great value for your money. Screen not Smoked but very bright. Takes lovely pictures and Android system for loads of apps. Good camera build and comes with case. Dual SIM and mini DD card can be used. 5 stars as does everything well for this upcoming brand.",
            "Nice looking and nice size phone, screen quality seems very good as does camera, also bonus you get free clear case and has screen protector already applied.",
            "A really nice phone with many inbuilt features like 4K video and High Definition photography with its five lenses including close up macro and panoramic wide view all in great quality.\nIt has access to all the usual apps in store and comes with a protective gel backing and a screen protector already installed. I purchased a fau leather wallet style fau leather case very cheaply from elsewhere. It makes a great little stand when watching tv on the phone. Easily worth five stars!",
            "Very nice phone according to price.looks great.good battery",
            "The best smartphone ever, best balance between quality-price",
            "Would recommend to anyone great value",

            "Very premium looking for this price range recomended",
            "The price-value ratio is very good. There are two small mistakes, but they are perfect for so much money.",
            "Lovely looking phone, does everything you need, but, it's battery life is very poor.",
            "I have had Motorola phones for many years, but after reading reviews on this TCL 10L I thought I would give it a go, and blimey this is an awesome phone for the price, brilliant camera and super fast operations on the phone, and a fingerprint reader that works brilliantly, if you need a great value phone then look no further, the only downside is not a vast supply of phone cases for this phone, but I found some on Amazon. I loved this phone so much I purchased one for my wife also.",
            "Phone that is fast easy to use and ready out the box, it's only a hybrid SIM card tray\n but if you like that kind of thing it's fine",
            "Music has no other sound effects or enhancement features even when use sound go very low compare to other budget phone its not very good pretty disappointing very limited options. In regards to battery it would not last long so pretty much charge it every day even in minimum use.",

            "honestly for the price it's great cheap and works better than more expensive phones highly recommend great amount of ram quad camera , holepunch front camera very thin edge and the top speaker is places nicely for your ear highly recommend if you want a good phone that runs well for a low price",
            "Great for the price.i was hoping for a better battery",

            "Great phone..great price...great product good suport from tcl",
            "This is a nice phone bright screen, has two sim ports so personal and work kept separate, 4G on both Sims has a full range of sensors including magnetic compass Glonass and NFC, has Bluetooth 5 connects to all my Bluetooth speakers and head phones no problem regardless of make.Screen is smooth no stutter comes with protector installed and silicone cover, fast charge capability too. Battery is really good lasts all day running delivery app which is very power hungry, it's a good all rounder.",

            "Bought this after reading reviews and glad I did because it's a great phone and good specs like smart button on side but be wary because as soon as you turn in it updates and takes this feature away.According to TCL Google wants it that way",
