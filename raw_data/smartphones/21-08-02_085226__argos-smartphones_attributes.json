            "I've had 5 Samsung phones over a near 10 year period. I was so excited to get this phone in march 2020. Over a year on and I can't wait to get rid of it. The camera is always blurry and no charger cable stays in the charging point very well. I wish I'd not got it and won't be getting another Samsung phone. So disappointing",
            "I really do love this phone but unfortunately it's poor battery life let's it down. I'm not on my phone all the time and still have to charge it twice a day which really isn't very convenient when leafing a busy life. Very disappointed as only bought in December but already feel like I need a new one.",
            "this phone is all singing all dancing except when it comes to performing its primary function making and receiving phone calls it is without doubt the worst phone ive ever bought and will without boubt be the last samsung i ever buy",
            "The third and by far the worst Samsung phone I've had. The S6 and S8 were really good but this S20 Fe 5g is a poor effort. Very disappointing battery life, auto connects to previous WiFi but switches the phone to vibrate (I've missed calls because of this), and it carries out a string of actions when it's in my pocket. Avoid.",
            "NO USEWR MANUAL AVAILABLE IN BOX OR ON WEB SITE . ONLY GET MORE ATTEMPTS TO SELL ME ANOTHER PHONE. WHAT DON'T THEY UNDERSTAND. THEY SOLD ME THE PHONE AND NO USER MANUAL",
            "The  camera on this phone is absolutely amazing. All other features are up to the usual high standards I've come to expect from samsung. If I had to pick out a bad point it would be that the finger print scanner position takes a bit of time to get used to other than that it's the best phone I've ever owned",
            "Works great, better battery than my last one. 30x Zoom is just a gimmick, it' not in the slightest bit good and the picture quality is useless at anything past 10x zoom",
            "The phone is very good but I've had issues with load speaker twice, went in first time had it back 2 months and same fault occurred",
            "I loved my old S8 so when it was time for an upgrade I thought let's stick with Samsung so bought the S20 ultra expecting huge improvements, sadly there weren't as many as I expected apart from the super fast charge which is great for obvious reasons and the camera but realistically I don't often use the 100 x zoom so more of a gimmick. My biggest bug bear about the phone is that the have taken away the notification led next to the camera, I didn't know that they had done this from the S10 model but please Samsung can we have it back. The rest of the phone from what I can tell is exactly the same as the older S series phones which were good but if you're expecting a drastic change then you will be disappointed, I would suggest save yourself the money and buy an older model as they are just as good but with a lower price tag.",

            "The phone is nice although I purchased this because of the camera. Its a big let down to be honest.",
            "It is mind boggling how can anyone 5* this phone? I have wanted to give chance to Samsung after they promised 3 years update plan. Never again. First off, in Europe you get inferior version with Exynos processor. Second, You pay premium but get bland copy of “iOS maker” products. Thirdly, Samsung decides to harass you with notification about Samsung cloud, and you can't turn them off, mostly likely because \"they care\" about my non-existent data in theirs cloud. Lastly, if you want safe device in android ecosystem only choice is Google made ones, end of story. Otherwise, just switch ecosystem to iOS and pray your phone will last longer than 2 years on warranty.",

            "The phone over all is pretty decent and after coming from a Huawei it was real easy to use. The main reason I got this phone was for the camera and I have to say it's soooo disappointing! The pictures are terrible! You could take better pictures with a potato, my old Huawei p20 pro was a million times better. Save your money!",
            "It's excellent for photos games it's top 10",
            "Everything perfect in this phone. Love it",

Previously had a Huawei P30, which I was very happy with, but this outperforms it in every single category. Glad I got a case for it as well, as I'm definitely a dropper, because I really want to keep this looking and working perfect for years. Well done Samsung.",
            "Very quick! Will need a manual to be familiar with all these new gadgets, great phone.",
            "So easy to use, transfer from my old huawai honor was really easy following instructions. Very good clear camera too. Battery life could be a bit better but that could be as I'm using it alot to get used to all the features",
            "I am so glad I got this phone! It has such an amazing screen, I was blown away. It also has such a great camera setup and I am very happy with it in general. Thank you Samsung!",
            "Camera is amazing graphics great too",
            "I have had this phone for a few days now and honestly, I'm not enjoying it. These are things that let it down for me: there is no headphone jack so you will either need to use wireless buds or use the usb earphones provided but that means you cannot charge your phone with a usb at the same time which is very inconvenient, I don't know why Samsung thought this would make the phone better or lightweight, as If wired ear buds carry weight? Another thing is the black hole permanently at the top of the screen, I think it's the selfie camera - it's very ugly. Also there is no more LED notification light, to show if you've missed any notifications. Another thing is the selfie camera is absolutely the worst I have seen, I cannot even express how bad it is - the images are blurry and grainy and very poor quality - I wad very shocked and disappointed about this one because who wants a rubbish selfie? I upgraded from a Samsung s8 and I honestly wish I hadn't because I much preferred that phone to this one!",
            "The phone camera it’s just amazing. You can do million effects or different modes! Also the graphic on phone it’s just wow, you can play PC games without worrying to be get frozen or for blurry views. Highly recommending !",

            "My history with Samsung devices has been as follows:\n\nGalaxy note 8\nGalaxy note 9\nGalaxy note 10 plus\n\nThe screen on the S20+ is absolutely stunning whilst in 120hz mode.  The colour range appears rich and almost juicy in nature.  Performance is on par with my previous note 10+ handset and I've not missed not having a stylus.  The screen size on the other hand is just perfect on the S20+.  I found my 10plus just a tad too large so this is a welcome change.  When discounted, the S20+ makes total sense.  \n\nNice work Samsung!",

Need to leave the sound on so I can hear the alarm then I get woken up during the night with alerts going off. It's a poor set up",
            "I've been quite disappointed with this phone,  I replaced a mate 20 pro and am a little sad that I did. The Samsung feels really light and plasticity. The screen is smaller and the way its set out seems to not work well. The sound has less depth than the Huawei although it sounds a little clearer, I think it would be tiring to listen to. Finally, face recognition and finger print recognition is very slow, I'm used to the phone being up and unlocked as soon as its vertical, sadly not the Samsung.i hope I find some redeeming features, it feels like a huge downgrade, if I didn't know better I'd say this was a mid range phone. I didn't think Huawei were so far ahead.",
            "I am a really great fun of Samsung. I have owned multiple models since the S3. I usually don't write bad reviews since I don't think it is really worth my time, since life is too short for this. However, after having some bad experiences with my previous S9 I was waiting anxiously for my upgrade from my provider, hoping that the thoroughly acclaimed S20 will fulfill my issues. And it did, for about two weeks. Great screen, better camera, faster and a hassle free and accurate data transfer. Only drawbacks were a less than poor finger print recognition (a bit of a shame for a 2020 phone) and the fact that it has been shipped with wired headphones when the phone doesn't have an input for those anymore (I haven't tasted your joke, dear Samsung).\nI am pretty good wit phone handling. I haven't  scratched any phone in all these years and I have never used screen protectors (I was wondering why people are buying them) and used only leather or silicone Samsung original cases. My previous S7 edge and S9 didn't get a single scratch after four years of intense usage!\nHowever, this new wonder boy, S20 5G managed to get a big scratch on the front screen (probably from my jeans, same ones that I used to wear while using the S9) in the first two weeks of use. And like this isn't enough to get me crazy and frustrated, it somehow caught two scratches on the back, while protected by an original Samsung case!!!\nDear Samsung, I know that releasing a perfect phone that will last for years is bad for business, but this is a real shame. The speed and battery will suffer anyway over the next two years (the usual contract time for most GSM providers), but to issue it with build quality issues from beginning is way too low for you.\nSuch a pity...",
            "Been using the phone for about 6 months now and can honestly say its the best phone I've owned. I work in mobile phones so get to experience a broad range of phones and this is by far the best.",

(That wasn't that great either).\n\nMY GREATEST TIP:\nBUY A PROTECTIVE CASE.\n\nOk what do I love?\nMost of it, to be fair.\n\nIt is an upgrade to the 10+, and quicker, and smoother.\n\nThe camera, takes some really sharp clear pictures even in nite mode. I think even better than the S10+. Nite mode is quicker, and clearer \n\nFor some reason touch screens don't like me, but I don't seem to have the issues, I had with the S10+.\n\nVery responsive, and quick.\n\nFor its size, with a case it's very light, but with a case, it's safe. I'm using Samsung's own case, and it doesn't really add much weight.\n\nMost annoying is the volume on the left. It's slightly out of reach without moving your hand, and it's harder to do full screen copy. The swipe? More hassle than using left hand to assist. \n\nI love the edge options. The screen grab being my fave. Comes in very handy when using Instagram, as you can grab those links people insist on adding to images. The screen grabber will seoerste text, and makes it easy to grab a link. Definitely keep that option. \n\nEdge options are great overall, obvs some you'll won't to kill!\n\nTalking of killing, press n hold a blank space on homescreen, and open homescreen options. Kill BIXBY.  On S10+ was a button, on S20+ it's a slide on homescreen. Killing it, means you won't accidently end up there. You can thank me with an up vote! lol\n\nSound, is very clear. If your hard of hearing, you can still hear... I can anyways. Plus it has a setting for T3 n T4 hearing aids.\n\nI have no issues using Bluetooth. Any speaker earbud I've added, are so simple to add. You now have sound share on this phone. So I can share on your speaker, and you can share on my speaker, both without having to add the speaker by Bluetooth. Plus you can use twin audio... Having 2 apps that can play sound at the same time. Say, playing music on a speaker, and recording video at the same time.\n\nOverall this is definitely more of an upgrade from S8 than the S10 was. It's even a small upgrade from the S10, as I'm finding. ... 1 month in. Wished I'd gotten earlier to get the live buds. ... Anyone got some they want to do a deal with? Pm me.\n\nI do recommend this phone, more so than o did the S10+",

The photo software is not that great, there is no AI with photos and the appature doesn't go down low enough.\n\nThere is only 128 gb of memory. The fingerprint scanner is temperamental and finding a cover that works with the fingerprint scanner is a nightmare.\n\nI am planning on getting my old phone fixed and giving this s20 ultra to my daughter. It just doesn't cut the mustard for me.\n\nSamsung, I have been away from your products for 4 years and this reintroduction does not impress me.\n\nThe only saving grace is the gorilla glass.",

The camera is great, but I want the camera spec to reflect the level of zoom that can be achieved without visible image degradation.\n\nThis Said, the low light processing and high speed processing is impressive.\n\nHad issue in the UK in non-5G areas that 5G auto does not auto downgrade to 4G or 3G where 5G or 4G signals  are not available.",

Then there wasnt anything good for a while and I had a OKish LG full touch screen.\nThen came the Samsung Galaxy (original). Run on Android (brilliant linux based software). This phone was a game changer, I came back to Samsung for good . It was fantastic and since then the Samsung Galaxy range (for me) has never been beaten and I have never changed from this flagship phone.\nI had the original Galaxy, the S3, the S4, the S7 Edge (fell in love with the edge screen), the S9+ and now the S20 Ultra. They are simply unbeatable. I mean who puts a 108MP camera in a phone!!!\nIt came a time 2 years ago for my daughter to have a phone. I had the S9+, she had the S9. I know it has the security needed for her. This year as she's an amateur photographer we treated her to the S20 Ultra.\nThis phone like the range only get better. I will never change, everything about it, look, feel, battery life etc are fantastic.\nMy only note is that the internal memory has not changed since the S9 but it allows for a 1TB micro SD card.\nTheres no other phone that has ever measured up for me.",

Trying to take a close up of anything is a waste of time as the camera just can not focus. This is supposed to be a flagship phone but in my opinion it is more of an anchor slipping behind the opposition, I am really disappointed with my new phone that I have only owned for three weeks and it has seriously put me off purchasing another Samsung.

It was a very, very, very hard choice between the S20 ULTRA and the NOTE20 ULTRA. Yes i wish I had both, but having to choose i would say I made the best choice!

            "Having had the pleasure of owning this phone for over 2 months now, I can confidently say that it lives up to its 'Ultra' name. Everything about this phone is simply amazing. It could be argued that it is an expectation of Samsung to have a great camera setup on its flagship devices, and still the Ultra's cameras are mighty amazing. The addition of a 100 times zoom function makes it one of the most interesting and unique phones available, although some may consider it a niche aspect. The device has superb performance and offers unrivalled power, taking on whatever you can throw  at it. The display is, of course, stunning given it's a Samsung phone. The WQHD+ display means you can watch all your favourite movies and shows in terrific high quality. Paired with the phone's powerful stereo speaker setup, you are practically given a cinema like experience, all in the palm of your hand. The battery life is on the upper end of what can be expected from a phone today, and it can easily last you through the entire day, even under fairly heavy use. Overall, I am totally in love with this phone and certainly do recommend it to anyone who is looking for a phone that truly is Ultra.",

After having the phone for precisely 24hours - it is now packed in a box to return due to the terrible camera!  Photos were either blurry, oversaturated or both.  I took quite a few flower pictures to test.  With my S9, the detail on the photos was amazing.  With the S20 - it was just a colourful blur with most of them.  \nExtremely disappointed with Samsung.  Looks like I will have to leave Samsung now after at least 6 years :(  \nAdvice to any other buyers of the S20 - great phone  - if you don't want to use the camera!!",

Granted that the camera is superb (screen and processor too but all seems to be aimed at making the camera better) but as a phone I guess the industry has plateaued as there seems to be no great leap forward on anything else. All sales info is about the camera and nothing about the phone. I was forced to upgrade and now I have the s20 hasn't moved on from the s8 as far as the phone (non camera related features) in fact a little backward with the loss of some useful features that its lost like headphone jack etc. Before anyone says anything I have Bluetooth headsets too but they don't last when you are on calls all day! \n\nFantastic Device...if you have not had anything newer than the S7 but not worth the upgrade from S8 or newer or you need a better camera phone.",

            "just to preface this review I'm a huge samsung fanboy or I was, I have always opted for samsung devices from my gear s3 to the new active 2, in my household we have every phone from the s6 edge to s10 plus and never had a problem with any of them until now with the s20 in my couple of days of using it the phone overheated so badly doing absolute basic tasks that it was hard to hold in my hand from the heat, the camera quality was dreadful compared to my now ancient s8. Naturally I asked for a replacement and now at the time of writing it has been over a month still no phone all the samsung help lines have been useless. Overall its been a truly terrible experience from the phone to the service. But to top it all off the most frustrating thing is samsung won't even acknowledge the reason for the phones overheating and having a terrible battery and general poor performance its due to the Exynos chip set we in this country are forced to have whereas the Snapdragon chipset is far far superior and is probably the phone you've seen reviewed everywhere, I feel this is absolutely disgraceful as we get an inferior product and have to pay the same price, in previous years the difference in chipsets was not as wide but this year the Exynos chip is dreadful and causing extreme heating up issues. Samsung are shooting themselves in the foot by treating half of their customers like they don't matter by giving us an inferior device. I do believe I will call samsung tomorrow and cancel my order as I only had the phone for a couple days and haven't seen it since, never thought I'd see the day where I would consider another brand but looks like i'll opt for the Oneplus 8 pro.",

Battery life is terrible and a lot of frustrating features like I won't charge when plugged into my in car charger even though its same socket. Also really annoys me that when I'm connected my phone through my car speakers or Bluetooth speakers I can't switch off notifications from coming through the speakers ruining my music listening. The whole user interface just isn't as easy to use either. Samsung just appear to be behind other android devices when they were always at the forefront.",

            "even though I love the phone there is one issue that I haven't been able to get resolved and that is the phone getting hot either while on an app or making a phone call. I'm aware that the equinox chip gets much hotter than the snapdragon one. Its also slower than the snapdragon.  I would like it if Samsung would change my phone for the snapdragon chip set one as I dont want the risk of it catching fire like the notes did. I had the s10 before and I'm using the same apps as I had on that with no extra ones so I can't see why the s20 ultra is getting so hot. Once hot and you put it on charge it doesn't charge fast at first and has to cool down before it will charge properly.",
            "I bought a s20 5g as a replacement for a s9 plus for two main reasons - I wanted something a bit smaller and easier on the pocket, and I wanted 5G capability. Well it turns out the standard s20 isn’t noticeably smaller than a s9 plus and 5G isn’t really going to be widespread for a while. There are some good points - great screen and very smooth operation. The camera takes good pictures but the software needs work, it’s quite complex. The fingerprint sensor is terrible - very slow and often registers a no-match. I also miss the LED indicator that shows you have email etc. All in all, I should have stayed with the s9 plus.",

            "Best of 2020 mobile phone",
            "So I had this other popular brand and it took very bad videos and photos in low light plus I needed an upgrade as I had it for 3 years, the specs for their Max, Pro etc were not so good so I came across the Samsung s20 Ultra and after reading about it the specs seemed very good so I bought it and honestly it’s the best phone ever and the best choice I made. I spent around 7 hours in the park I played music on it for 5 hours or so and took photos and videos and still I had around 50%- 57% battery left, good speakers and volume, performance and the smoothness of the phone itself it excellent. Good thing is I can put in a 1TB memory card although 128GB is enough for me. There's no fault in this phone I can’t wait to go and explore more places, go on vacations and take photos and videos. The phone is big and weighs a lot but after a week you get used to it, typing with one hand is possible but if your hands are really small then no and doing that on a big phone is not really ideal anyways due to the size it’s better to type with two hands. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.",
            "I think Samsung have achieved near perfection with the Samsung Ultra. The near 7\" screen is what I need for work and play. Movies look amazing, I thought I'd notice the hole punch camera more but actually it weirdly blends in to the screen experience so you hardly notice it. You'd think a phablet this size would be awkward in the hands, and even though mine aren't that big for a guy it's quite a comfortable experience. I'd gone over to iPhone for about a year but I'm so glad I came back to Samsung; the functionality and flexibility of android and the Samsung UI is so much more satisfying. The camera is incredible and I love photography on the Ultra. Initially I found the Ultra a little warm during use but it seems to learn your usage and I never have had or do have any major issues with it. In fact since the last update it's not an issue at all anymore. Gaming, reading books, watching a film while writing an essay (picture in picture) all looks incredible on Ultra's screen. Also, insane power and memory  - it'll be a long time before you can push its limits.",

            "The 'new' galaxy S20 ultra disappoints on many levels. The fingerprint sensor hardly ever works first time, the proximity function works about 50% of the time and the battery life is really bad. All in all, very disappointed.",
            "The good:\nThe 120Hz QHD+ display (although you cannot use both at the same time) feels very smooth to use, the specs are great so you are unlikely to experience any noticeable lag when doing anything on the phone (although if you don't live in China, South Korea, Japan, or the USA you will get an inferior Exynos processor instead of a Snapdragon), and the software offers many useful features, such as Bixby, a talking assitant, and upday, a curated news feed. The camera is good, but not exceptionally so - we'll get to that in a bit.\n\nThe bad:\nContrary to the phone's aggressive marketing, the camera is not the best in the market. There are other phones by different companies that I am not allowed to name that can do the same things this phone's camera can do but better. The 100x zoom is also unsurprisingly mostly useless, and it is usually made worse by processing, leaving the image looking less like a photo and more like an oil painting, hence the 'space zoom' is not really a feature. But that is not the biggest problem.\n\nThe vast majority, nay, pretty much all of the camera's features are only available in the normal photo mode, as Pro mode only offers the main camera's 12MP mode. That means no manual focus (this is important because there are still some autofocus problems), no RAW photos and no precise control of exposure for the wide-angle lens, the telephoto lens and the 108MP mode. In turn, that means that if you intend on using the Pro camera mode, you are no better off using the S20 Ultra than, say, the Galaxy S7. Third-party apps are also limited in their capabilities, meaning that what the stock camera app can't do, a third party app probably can't either. Since the main selling point of the phone was the camera, for me this limitation is a complete dealbreaker, especially when considering that all of the phone's main competitors have no problems with including all of their camera's features in their respective 'pro modes', or at least allowing third-party apps to do so. And Samsung's multi-camera phones have always had this problem in their Pro modes, so I would not expect a feature update any time soon, if ever.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are at all interested in the camera, do not buy the S20 Ultra, or any of the S20 phones. If you are not, well, then there is no problem.",

            "Upgraded from my iPhone XR, was the best choice I ever made had it for a Very cheap price. 8K camera and the 4K resolution on YouTube is outstanding. The phone itself perfect well happy. Also 120hz refresh rate as-well from 60hz no other smartphone does it like this phone. Best choice ever.",
            "I have the S20 Ultra, it is proving to be a great phone, what has suprised me is how long the battery lasts on a full charge. I use my phone frequently throughout the day and still it keeps going all day.\nThe camera is great although it may take some time before I get the hang of all the features.\nAll round a great purchase.",
            "On my second phone in as many months as the first 1 continually re booted every 30 seconds, second phone has now required a Factory Reset as died when doing the latest update ironically.  I have Used Samsung for years and still have an S10 which I will not be doint the update on, wish I hadn't bothered upgrading ( if you can call 2 bad phones upgrading ) and stuck with the old one.",
            "I've had my Samsung S20 ultra for just over a month now and so far so good,fantasti doped while surfing the web but I did get this phone for the camera and it has disappointed me in respect of shutter lag and over all picture quality,yes it does capture some brilliant photos but more often than not the photo is not worth keeping because the shutter lag is so slow I miss the shot or it ends up blurry and another thing I've noticed is my signal goes away to the point where I have to turn my phone off and on again and I'm pretty clued up on phones and I've done everything to cure this problem but it still happened,it's still a good phone but it's far from a game changer,sorry Samsung",

            "Awesome in one word. Im not a professional reviewer, just a fan. I would love the headphone jack back. Samsung is awesome itself,no need to follow noone. Great job samsung, all the products.",
            "Really good, but not great, the camera quality had its hiccups but most have been ironed out with recent updates. One drawback and the main reason for 3 stars is the use of the inferior Exynos SoC compared to the Snapdragon chipset used in the US variant.",
            "Every 2 years I pass on my Samsung flagship phone to my son and but the new one normally experiencing a wrath of new performance and exoerience. The S20 is disapointing as it is actually a worse user experience for me. The loss of a button I use for 2FA, the useless finferprint sensor and the cost are major negative factors. I researched tbe Huawei P40 for the camera however could not accept no Google as much as I am against privacy intrusion Google is just too useful day to day. The S20 camera I find way over processed and its false to call it intelligent software manipulation. I much prefer real quality and dynamic range in my photos. Overall thate is not one standout feature that makes me happy to have upgraded from the Galaxy S9. Apologies for spelling mistakes but please accept my point ahead of my literate ability? Rhank you and save you money.",

            "The S20 Ultra is a superb phone but the fact that the are still camera issues (front and back) after 3 months loses it a star. The speed is impressive and I love the screen. Photo quality is impressive but even now the fact that it won't quickly focus and take a picture is annoying. After the recent update the speed that the front camera takes a picture has increased notably",

            "For over the years me and my sibling we only used the Galaxy S gama and is always like we aspect but the camera on the 20 Ultra is totally game changing, still need to test all the other functions but the best one so far! And I could claim for the galaxy watch",
            "This is a power house phone. Super quick on all tasks. It really covers most bases perfectly. The camera is where this phone fails terribly. The zoom is pretty much useless past 50X as the picture degradation is bad. There is a long delay from tapping the button to the picture being taken, which sometimes results in a picture of motion blu or worse. This phone seems to have a very very tough time auto focusing. I've given up trying to focus on anything inches away from me. Luckily I don't use the camera that much otherwise this would be a two star review. I think there are better options out there for most users. To recap, terrible camera but great phone overall.",

            "Yeah I think the phone is great, my only issue is that I can't find a rear camera lense cover that doesn't ruin the camera quality, if samsung could release a lense cover that maintained the high quality images I would be fully content.",
            "I love my photography and shoot with a DSLR. When I saw the reveal for the phone I thought ' I've got to have me one of those!' and bought it as soon as I could. Fast forward several weeks and I got the handset and tested the features I was really interested in. Here's what I thought:\nPonderous shutter - On action shots there's a hopeless gap between pressing the capture button and the image being taken.\n\nInconsistent Focusing - If I tap on the screen, that's where I expect the focus to be, not somewhere the AI thinks it should. Ridiculous\n\nSpace Zoom is about much use as an ashtray on a motorbike - As the key feature on the Ultra 100x zoom is just a gimmick. Totally unusable in the real world and the JPEG captured is awful. 30x zoom isn't any better\n\n10x Optical Zoom - Now this is usable, but again the JPEG captured isn't great\n\nPro Mode - A total waste of space. Tells you have control without giving you the option of changing the aperture, the most vital aspect of the exposure triangle. You take a zoomed in picture with RAW picture selected and you get the same picture as if taken with no zoom. And when you zoom into it, it's not fantastic.\n\nI have taken some great shots with the camera, it's great at landscape or portrait photography, for example. I didn't buy this to take pictures of what I was eating for Instagram, but aviation action shots to post online. I feel I've been duped into buying the most expensive model on some VERY dubious advertising when the S20 or S20+ would've been better for day to day photography.\n\nThings I like about this phone - Everything aside from the camera aspect of ownership. I don't even have to say what I'm not so keen on as it's blindingly obvious. It's a great phone, fantastic screen and fast when it doesn't freeze. Happened a lot when I first got it and thankfully the raft of updates released have made it better, but still happens a few times a week (NEVER happened on my old Galaxy S9+). I like the wireless power share feature, great for topping up the battery on my S3 Frontier watch or Buds+. The most recent update finally sorted the macro end of the camera focusing problems. Please do something about the rest of the focal range",
            "Camera us great...sound quality is amazing especially  if u use galaxy buds.. Great product",
            "had the phone for about two months. Uk version  exynos 990. Love the 120 hz display, however battery life really falls very quickly with this enabled. With light /moderate use im getting about 4-5 hours of screen on time on average according to the samsung battery stats. Playing call of duty the phone really heats up and battery goes quickly also. Even adjusting the game settings to assist didn't really help. \n\nSelfie camera is good quality but is very slow. So you click the shutter and think I've got a good one there of you and another person. Then you realise you have a picture of scenery or someone's leg etc.\n\nI was expecting all day battery life but I struggle to get through a full day. I normally use it for youtube, chrome browser, about an hour of call of duty and emails. Followed by the occasional call and texts throughout the day.  \n\nTo be clear it is a great phone, but I was expecting more from the battery. I have managed to improve the battery life by dropping back down to 60hz and going for the higher display resolution instead WQHD+. I get nearer to the five hours screen on time. Please note I only use samsung power adapter and samsung wireless charger also. Due to the large camera bump I would highly recommend the Samsung armour case as protects the camera glass very well as they protrude from the back of the phone.",

            "Got this phone as an upgrade not only did have have to send it back twice as there was problems with both phone and when I did get a working phone.

            "Everything about the S20 Ultra specs I read screamed buy me!\n\nI got the phone in mid May and I have to say.. its not worth the money that is being charged (not Argos's fault).\n\nHere come the negatives (sorry just being honest)\n\n-The camera auto focus is very hit and miss. \n-The battery overheats terribly\n-The battery life is very poor whilst preaching it's supposed to be amazing\n-The in screen fingerprint sensor is also hit and miss sadly",
            "I have had nothing but issues with the phone since I upgraded to it. \nConstantly freezes and crashes. \nCamera keeps displaying camera failed when trying to take a photo, it also won't save videos. \nApps don't run properly on it Spotify being one. \nReally unimpressed.",
            "This phone isn't too different from my previous device, and although the S20 Ultra was advertised as this new device with all these new features, the best thing i can think of is the longer battery life..\n\nYes the camera has improved, but isn't much better than other devices that are already out there.\n\nOverall disappointed with the price of the phone, considering what you're actually paying for.",
            "Camera glass hairline fracture just appeared after leaving the device in the sun. I live in the UK so trust me the the sun here wouldn't have been an issue with the device getting too hot. Phone has been in a huge protective spigen quality case since day 1 so incant explain how this occurred. Not a mark on the phone and never been dropped.",
            "Price for the phone is too high and the quality that you get just isn't worth the price. The phone overheats, freezers and the zoom is terrible. My S5 and S8 were just as good for taken photos. This will be my last Samsung phone especially of customers in the USA get a better deal.",
            "I upgraded from my S9+ to the S20 Ultra and love it. Great phone and a fantastic camera. Only slight niggle is the predictive text can be annoying at times and the phone doesn't have the flash LED which I relied on quite a lot to see what type of notification I had received when my phone was charging. Other than that it's all good.",
            "So i have been a samsung product user for years since the galaxy s3 so its been a very long time i have beeing using there productm religiously id buy the latest device every day. This year was the s20 ultra 5g which i was looking forward too. The whole focus point is the camera but the camera is okay it is good but to buy a s20 to a s20 ultra for the sake of 100x zoom i actually dont think its worth it the zoom is not clear or anything it was more of a gimic and a marketing stunt. Samsung cant disagree upon this as i have also got a additional s20 ultra for my dad he has the same issues and this is with latest updates Samsung you have failed to impress when you look at your competitors new rivals like the huwawi p40 they eat all over your devices and thats the hardest thing to say as a samsung user.",

            "so unhappy with the new s20 ultra, for the price it should be the best out there but it is far far from that.\nFrom the poor camera to its freezing screen and you have to wait for it to come back or turn off the phone.\nIf i could send it back I would.",

Waiting for another Android update, maybe they will improve it.\nApart of that is a lovely phone with high specs :)",

            "I just get a brand new S20 ultra. I turned it on, used it for 2 minutes and it was so hot that I could not even touch it. Big dislike about that. Now I have to call costumer services. I see on internet about that exynos. Now I'm afraid to order another one cause they don't have with the snapdragon.",
            "Had the note 10 plus before. And the note was hands down a better phone. So at the price point, I'm pretty disappointed. Focus issues on camera straight out the box. Battery life not as good as expected. Unable to use high refresh rate on top resolution. For way in excess of 1000 u should be able to do all at once. Multi tasking also felt better on note. Disappointed but if you never had a note 10 plus or flagship phone. The phone is definitely good. Amazing build quality though. Best so far I've had on a Samsung. Very premium feel.",
            "The Samsung S20 Ultra 5G beats all my expectations! Samsungs cameras were always excellent, but this just beats everything! \nI don't need to charge my phone for days and it is so fast. \nDefinitely worthwhile! Well done Samsung!!",

            "Absolutely love this phone!! Was sceptical at first about getting this phone as the reviews wasn't great, but I really love it! The camera is amazing on it so clear a captures the moment perfectly! The screen is so clear and layout is good and easy to use. The phones a little heavier then most phones but thats understandable. I upgrade from the s9 to this phone and best choice I made, hard to get use to the finger sensor on the front but it picks up your face soon as you pick the phone up its very quick, dosent freeze or get hot. And battery lasts a day and a half!!! Very very good phone",

            "I want to love this phone. After an S7+, and an S10+ this was the natural upgrade. I do like the screen size. Thats about it. It will be being returned. For a flagship phone, there are a great many camera issues and I cant keep factory resetting on the hope they get fixed. Close up macro shots non existent, the AI after  processing of images ruins them, not to mention the delay I've been experiencing in shutter speed, taking up to 8 seconds to actually take a photo! Its appalling.  So very disappointed.",
            "I traded in an S8 for the S20 Ultra, which makes this my 4th Samsung phone, so I feel reasonably comfortable saying that I know the brand and product history pretty well. Having picked the phone up on launch day, I've had it for a while now, but still feel like I've only scratched the surface of this phone's capabilities, particularly in photographic terms. This phone has it all! Awesome battery life, beautiful screen, feature rich and blisteringly quick. Couldn't be without it now. The 100x zoom delivers some great results too.",

            "i pre-ordered S20 Ultra with a great hype and passion for the phone with its superior specs. However, my own experience of the phone has not been that great. I have always been using Samsung phones for the past several years from Galaxy Ace to S3, S5, S7, S9 and now S20 Ultra. And I would say thay my S9 and S7 was giving a better performance than s20 ultra on a price/performance scale measurement. I am a delivery driver and when my location services are on I dont even get 3hrs screen time I understand that location services drains the battery but I was getting better time in S9 after 1 year of use. I have to charge the phone few times a day to keep it going until the end of the day. Also the phone lags from time to time when I try to move from one application to another via the recent apps the screen lags and freezes I then have to lock the screen and unlock again for the phone to unfreeze considering the power of the phone thisshould not be happening even on my s7 lagging started to happen after year and a half of use not after 2 months of use. Yes, it is a great phone with great futures but my essential requirements are not very responsive from the phone. This review comes from a real Samsung lover, all my digital products are Samsung from my laptop to Samsung tv to my headphones Level On Pro to my watch Gear S3.",
            "everything is really good, Camera is amazing aswell",
            "Bigger screen is a plus however some of the changes are a step backwards in my view.\nI cannot use headphones and charge at the same time. I now need to have a bulky adaptor swinging below on what is meant to be a sleek expensive mobile. It may be cheaper to manufacture without the extra port but it is not an upgrade if it causes more inconvenience to the consumer. I am being laughed at by users of cheaper models.\nThe volume up and down is now the same side and so close to screen standby it causes constant mistakes by me pressing the wrong button.\nHaving a change screen option immediately below the keyboard space bar again causes constant touching in error.",

Only 1 minor thing is the phone is slightly big for those with smaller hands, but my advice for those people is to purchase a case with good grip.

            "Great resolution, colour, good zoom, but files are very large, so much so that I can't upload a photo to this review \"photo too large\"",
            "Generally a good phone all round.\n I have been with Samsung for years now and this may be the only one that I have been disappointed with.\nThe camera is great if you are taking pictures of things from far away and are staying still. The focus on this camera is terrible. If I am close to something or trying to focus something inpertucular it just doesn't work and isn't worth doing. In comparison to my previous S10+, the S10+ was better by far.\nThere is the battery life too. On my S10+ I could get well over a full day without a sweat. Now on my S20 Ultra I'm getting a sweat on wondering when I will be able to find somewhere to charge it when it gets to evening (I have 5g turned off and various other settings).\nDon't get me wrong, this is a brilliant device and I would recommend it. However I think there is a lot more that could be done to improve.  For the price you pay for this phone I think that I should get a little more out of it.\n\nOverall its a good phone.",
            "honestly.... not that much different to the s10+. wish i waited for the next model maybe then would it be an actual upgrade",
            "love the new design, sturdy build, features and the fluidness of the OS!",
            "The phone is very average. I would rate it more if the the focus on the camera finally worked. And the finger print scanner was more sensitive. The battery life is quite poor even on all the settings are changed the battery doesn't last as long as stated.\n\nOverall the device is OK for day to day use but once you dig deep, unfortunately its not worth the money paid. \n\nHopefully Samsung change things on updates and future designs as I am a fan of the company and their products.",
            "I am in love with my knew Samsung ultra 20 picture quality is so good battery life is amazing so far I have no complaints",
            "Easy to use .great camera great all round phone for all ages",
            "I like the phone a lot. Screen is fluid and beautiful. Claiming 100x zoom is a bit too much as the quality at 100x is not good. Anyway its packed with features as you might expect for a device as expensive as this and feels solid. I will cut to my gripes. \n\nQuite often, the web browser will just freeze (I use Chrome) and I need to click on the task switcher icon and back to the app without closing it and it will work fine.\n\nNot using the Snapdragon processors puts it behind in terms of performance and power consumption, a shame for a flagship product - Samsung, either make a true rival processor or concede and use the best. Perhaps with the rumoured use of AMD chipsets in the future will mean the S21 will have the power it deserves.\n\nAnd the fingerprint sensor is poor. So many times it doesn't pick up my print (may need to lick my thumb to get it working) or simply reverts to password.\n\nIt's still amazing and I still love it, just those few things need sorting.",
            "excellent camera bright decent size screen good battery life",
            "Great device takes fab pictures battery life fantastic\nOnly drawback camera as it sticks out damages easily",
            "phone is good but for some reason or another if you shake the phone it seems to rattle like a baby toy.",
            "super fast easy to use the only issue I've found is the lock button is too close to the volume control but apart from that a great handset",
            "Overall the phone is good, but I don't think I'm the only person who relies on their phone for it's camera. Prior to getting the S20 Ultra I had a Galaxy S9, and the image quality was superb. The S20 seems incapable of taking a decent image! No matter what I try, what settings I use, every image is blurry around the edges. I was going to sell my S9 to recoup some of the cost of the S20, but I've actually kept it just so I can use it for photography. I should add this isn't user error, I've seen countless similar reviews online, just wish I'd paid attention to those before I bought it. Really disappointed.",
            "Great Phone, brilliant Camera, big memory.\nclear quality with calls.\nGreat screen size and the quality of the screen is just perfect",
            "Always pleased with the support .. ok was a bit chaotic this time ( corona virus ) but got there in the end",
            "The phones big selling point was the 100x space zoom which I have only ever used to show friends as for the screen the 120hz refresh rate is nice but you have to sacrife resolution for it there is no option to use 4k and 120hz why??? Also the phone rattles if you tilt it back and forth I'm guessing it the camera module becuse if you have the camera app open it stops as for the module wow the camera bump is massive which means a thick case to try and level the back out a bit which adds weight to an already heavy phone, overall its a decent phone but expensive and there a lots of phones out there now with close to the same features for a lot less money if I didn't have the option to upgrade every year I'd of probably stuck with my s10 for another year and see if Samsung did anything different then",
            "by far the best Samsung model I've owned 10/10 highly recommended",
            "Love this phone. Build quality is outstanding! Would recommend again!",
            "I've have Samsung phones since the s2 and never been disappointed in any of the phones coming up the s20 ultra this phone is unbelievable the camera is outstanding the sound just stunning best phone on the market by far highly recommended",
            "Display speed camera sound \nThe overall performance",
            "as many people I bought this for the camera so the rest of it is not used to its full potential so would be unfair to comment on. The camera on the other hand is superb but it would be nice to have Samsung tutorials on best settings and stuff. So over all stunning thank you.",
            "not worth the price tag paid outright for it and the only good thing I can says is the camera. I preferred my S9 !!",
            "I had the device for just 7 days had to send it back to the carrier because I couldn’t use a the main security feature when I had a screen protector on it",
            "phone is fine does everything it should do, but for the price I would expect a better screen protector as the factory fitted one is too easily damaged",
            "I was so excited to get my s20 ultra about how they was raving over the camera. There's been a few updates to try and fix the issues but have only made it worse everytime I try take a picture now the camera is delayed and ive missed so many great shots because of this I wish i would of got the s20 plus because the camera on that is better quality ive compared mine to my friends. I wanted to get the ultra because I love taking pictures of my kids but lately hardly got any because of the cameras poor features I wouldnt recommend the ultra at all. Ive had the galaxy series since the s3 and this one is by far the worst the camera is just getting worse with every one that comes out",
            "I love everything about the phone the x100 zoom on the camera is mind blowing",
            "its an ok phone, camera is pretty much the only thing that really is annoying it is to close to the edge and stop most case from holding the phone.",
            "great phone for everyone camera is brilliant as is the performance. Not much more you can ask for really. Just make sure you get a case as camera does stick out abit.",
            "I love the new camera & speakers on this phone. Infact, most things about it are superb.\nHowever, a couple of niggles have left me unimpressed. Battery life isn't as long lasting as expected & advertised. \nAnd the biometric fingerprint log in is nowhere near as good as it was on the S8. It's so frustrating. Often trying 3 or 4 times to access, so much so that I often use the pin log in instrad.",
            "overall really nice device,  easy to use lots of nice features, very customisable some features harder to turn off than others though as difficult to find in the menus, really nice screen and camera, my only upset is the camera protection  this is large and apparently very delicate as mine cracked just whilst in my pocket for no apparent reason, now I have an exposed telephoto lens, not eager resistant anymore.  Other than this I can't fault the phone the battery lasts all even with multiple accounts receiving messages for the most of the day,  connects to other devices with ease.",
            "One of the main reasons I selected this model was the camera, but it has not lived up to my expectation. Overall a good phone but had hoped for so much better.",
            "Very good screen resolution and also great colours. Screen is tough and not scratched easily. Camera is astonishing, fantastic finish for all the pictures.",
            "stepping up from a galaxy s9 the s20 ultra took a little bit of getting used to regards size and wait. But now..... would I go back?......NO. few teething problems with camera but great display, great speed, great everything!",
            "The phone itself is good, fast, nice screen etc. Annoying that if you try to swipe back with the keypad still up it'll type a word instead, despite swiping from right on the edge of the screen. Then there's the camera, now don't get me wrong, landscape and portrait is amazing quality, the focus however is another story. Despite an update to fix this bug it is still not fixed on my phone. The image is blurry around the edges yet fine on other devices. Considering its the top of the range phone with 100x zoom it's a massive let down and the price doesn't help matters. After talking to Samsung and going through all their advice, taking pics and sending them through it still wasn't fixed have been told to wait for the next update. All in all the phone itself it's fine, it works, good quality but the focus let's it down for me",
            "Very good camera and I'm exploring more of this product.",
            "The display is so good, cameras are amazing and its so quick",
            "Amazing device.i am so happy with Samsung Products A*****",
            "Great screen and battery life, but disappointed in the much hyped zoom.  Shocking quality once you zoom to high magnification, anything over 30x is a waste.",
            "upgraded from the s10 and really glad i did. 5G ready is good to know although at present service is very limited.",
            "I love the device , it is really amazing, much faster then S10 , screen resolution is amazing ,camera is great , the only thing which I thought would have improved would be the battery life which is the same like the other models , can't survive for more then 5-6 hours . But other then that it's the best phone I had to date.",
            "As always a very powerful phone with awesome features as with all the s models I've had. But this is far superior.  BUT.. for no reason the glass on the camera has cracked! Its not been banged dropped or put down heavily on any surface and from what I've heard this is a problem . I've tried to get this replaced but it seems nobodys interested! Really frustrating as I only had 3 weeks and its not exactly cheap.  Please help me out samsung . Would of been 5 stars and would recommend to a friend if this design fault was rectified.",
            "I purchased this phone as upgrade and wow I am so glad I did. The camera is AMAZING I am able to take high quality photos of my first born. The battery life is the best I have known and I can go from dead to fully charged in under an hour. Highly recommend",

            "my phone was less than 1 hr old and it slid off my lap onto the carpet. Boom back has smashed.",
            "brilliant phone with brilliant hardware and software. Though there is still some way to go to make it perfect. The camera needs sorting so it works well on all apps and at all distances, also somesoftware so that taking pictures of screens they come out clearly. All other features seem to work well though it does get jumpy at times even though the hardware is rated higher than my laptop.",
            "I have had Samsungs for many years now. This phone is much better than the last one I had, however it should be at nearly double the price. I did a lot of research on the camera however when I try and use it, it is nothing like the adverts. The 100x zoom is pointless, and when I tried to take a photo up close, it would not focus and I had to give up. Otherwise, a very good phone, but overpriced.",
            "this is my fifth Samsung phone and they just keep getting better",
            "Well ive owned all of the s series phones and ive got to say the s20 is by far the best one yet the camera is absolutely amazing as well as the speed of the device itself.",

            "I've always been a Samsung user and with each iteration, my mobile experience just keeps improving. With the latest S20 ultra 5g, it's a huge leap forward for me. Living in an area that has 5g coverage, this means I always have fast speeds, whether downloading or Web surfing. Also the phone itself is a delight to use, sits nicely in the palm and is easy to navigate",
            "Not really happy with what I received, as it turns out Samsung (yourselves) have given me a faulty device and I cannot aend it in for an exchange as my phone is a mandatory part of my job.",
            "camera is fragile it is scratched now I need to.pay for it I didnt touch it",
            "Decided to invest in an S20 ultra for the camera. I wasn't disappointed, the detail captured is like nothing I've had before, took a photo of my dog at about 3 metres, when I zoomed in on the picture I had taken I could see every hair, whisker and nose detail. Colours are bright and clear, best shot function is great.",
            "Love the style & easy to use. The camera on the phone is amazing. The speed that the phone responds is also very good.",

            "The phone is a good size and easy to use. It has lots of features and is very fast. The battery isn’t too bad but you can do things to make it fast. I love the split screen feature. Great camera. Costs a lot of money but is a really great phone. Love Samsung and wouldn’t ever go to another brand",
            "This is the best phone I've ever had. So easy to navigate and takes superb photos",
            "Nothing negative to report, Samsung have got it spot on, the camera is superb, and the larger screen a dream.",
            "Phone is good, performs well, but you pay a hefty premium for it. wish samsung didnt include so much bloatware. got the wireless headphones with it for free which sweatened the deal!",
            "I use my device every day it my business device absolutely fantastic phone",
            "The camera is amazing, I've taken awesome photos with it and the zoom function is incredible. The phone looks great and is surprising light in your hand for its size. I would highly recommend this phone",
            "having had all the odd number models of the galaxy S series. Despite a few apps not workong on launch the phone itself is phenomenal. Camera really lives up to the dream (even started using it more) and the return of one of my favourite features the switching wallpaper lock screen. Love the device. Im still finding out new things about it. Winning",
            "When you read the specs of this phone you’d think it’s the best and fastest phone ever made but it’s nothing like that, yes it’s fast when used in 5G connectivity, but be in an area without 5G and your battery will drain like mad, I mean from 100% - under 20 in a matter of hours.\nPlus, your phone will get really hot for no apparent reason at all, twice I had to turn it off because it was hot and it would stay hot for as long time until I turned it off, that would never happen with my iPhone or with my S10 5G, so I’d be more weary now in believing everything that’s written on paper.\n\nAlso when the phone is used as an access  point it really drains the battery.\n\nVoice recognition is as bad as on the S10 5G, If not worse, doesn’t even fit in any comparison with Siri which would rarely not get right a command of “hey x” call x or y (contacts from my phone book).\n\nCamera is nice, could have been faster, not a chance to shoot something that’s moving, it’s sluggish and by the time it captures the image your hand might get arthritis. Also when wanting to take the shot of a document, looong time to recognise that it’s a document so “scan” features appears and then also quickly vanished, as nice as that feature is, it’s VERY fiddly.\n\nEmails come in MUCH later than on my iPhone most times and the IPhone isn’t even 5G ...... you judge that one for yourselves !",
            "Haven't experimented with the phone as much yet. Amazing camera, slightly heavy. Sometimes awkward using one hand. Excellent battery life.",

            "Love my S20 Ultra. Excellent features and the camera is amazing",
            "My gut feeling was telling me NOT to buy a samsung phone again, after last time I purchased my note 9, Then samsung removed the Video pro function with an update. This was the reason I brought the phone. So I was unsure for a while, and didnt really want an iphone, so I bit the bullet. MISTAKE. Good points and bad.  The sound is great, much improved. The Photos are great, although they are now too over saturated with colour. Why cant samsung get this right yet? The Video quality is good, BUT and this is a BIG but, the focus is very jumpy even after the \"FIX\" update, the camera is always trying to focus...too hard and the transistion from a close up to a distance shot is jumpy and not smooth at all. I compared it to my daughters very old Huawei and her camera is smooth, no jumps no problem. My phone the s20 ultra - a much newer phone, more expensive. is terrible. The battery is not any better than my note 9. The screen is better, clearer and bigger. The Key pad when typing is very clumsy and not forgiving... Generally not happy. I would be happy with it if the it recorded video smoother, but the auto focus is shocking. I wouldnt recommend this phone to anyone and wont be buying samsung again. This is my 10th samsung phone and it will be the last.",
            "I've now used Samsung for over 19 years. Each time I've tried another handset ive returned it and took another Samsung. Easy to use user friendly and i know its not totally p.c. but idiot proof. Always up to date with new apps and software and  all the accessories you will ever need with the same quality I now have a Tab, Bud+ and my second watch all Samsung.",

The s20 ultra ...is so cool  the transfer was super easy all up and running in minutes .I got it as I do alot of media photography and oh my ...the picture clarity is Awesome !!! Its just like being there in person when you view a picture  .love it love it love it !!! and the battery life is so much better !!",
            "Until 5g is turned on its as good as my s9 apart from the camera which is amazing both in quality and the awesome zoom",
            "Overall all the Samsung galaxy S20 ultra phone. The only couple of issues that I have the unlocking of the phone isn't as simple as it used to be on my note 8. I seem to have the mess about with the fingerprint sensor or double-tap the phone to find it in the first place. The only other thing that isn't as advertised is the 100 x zoom. 10 and 30 X zoom are great but there is no way on this planet that you could zoom into a man in a hot air balloon over a mile away and see him without him looking like a character from Donkey Kong. Other than that I am very happy with the battery life and the performance.",

            "I thought it would be hard to beat how much I liked my s10+ and when I first opened the box and held the s20 ultra I was a little shocked at how big and heavy it was but that was in comparison with a smaller lighter phone.\n\nThat soon dissipated and as soon as I got it started up it was like the s10+ had never left my hand it just got bigger and better.\n\nFrom the speed of switching menus to the fantastic camera and apps available on android this is a phone not to miss, the battery does me a full day and I'm a high user, the 1 hour fast charge is fantastic if you do need to charge.\n\nLooking forward to see how samsung best the s20 ultra next year but for now I'm happy with my purchase",

            "Great  machine keep up im forward to see next newone",
            "I urge Samsung to take notice of its forums and what everyone is saying about the S20 Ultra Exynos version because being in the UK that is what I am stuck with. After all the updates, phone still gets hot while using camera and especially gaming. Auto focus on camera is still unstable. Battery life is really bad, I have turned my phone down to 60hz FHD+ and dark mode just to get decent battery life. I have given 'Features' a low score due to the fact that it's not really a feature if it has problems, or you have had to turn it off so you can get better battery life. If I had the Snapdrahon 865 version I would be more than happy.",
            "Don't get me wrong the phone is absolutely amazing, flag ship status with amazing specs. It does everything I need and more. Just disappointing most of the world (UK) doesn't get the Snapdragon CPU but rather Samsung's own more battery hungry xynos offering. The camera, although great, has a real issue focusing on close objects. The 100 x zoom is fun but once you've used it for 5 minutes you will never use it again, it's just too pixelated. Not a fan of the off-centre camera bump either, makes a horrible vibration sound when you've got your phone on the table. Battery lasts me all day with regular 7h screen on time. The 120hz screen is phenomenal and a game changer. Overall the phone is still a remarkable bit if tech but I hope the next gen works out the few niggles.",
            "The camera is poor. Detail poor. Autofocus poor. The zoom settings are unusable beyond 10x. The space zoom is a joke. They should be sued for the adverts depicting this. It's a blobby, blurry mess.\n\nThe Huawei Mate 30 Pro camera is infinitely better.\n\nOther than camera. Phone is OK. Just an android phone. I bought it for the camera and was utterly disappointed.",
            "Amazing phone. Great battery life. Camera is as advertised but more internal capacity would have been nice however I can add a memory card. Great speed and slick to use. The samsung members app and offers are terrific. Overall very satisfied.",
            "love the camera very clear and easy to focus love all the added extras on the camera",
            "The phone it self wasn't bad , but the camera disappointed me. I'm photographer and camera in a handset is most important for me. I love my s10 plus and I was very excited about new galaxy S20 ultra. Unfortunately the camera is not as good as in my S10plus. The 100x zoom is unusable. Also it didn't focus when I wanted took a macro photo. So I returned this phone and I hope those all issues will be solved in newer model.",
            "The phone is packed with features and possibilities but the are four great rea world benifits which I find make it perfect for me, first its the battery life, doesnt matter how fancy your phone is if its dead. The second is the screen, its a joy to use. The size means I can use it for work far more than before. The third is the cameras but at the moment its the front, while working from home and using video calling / meetings everyone mentions how good the sound and picture quality is. The last is the performance, video calling, switching to docs, checking my diary and into emails in effortless seconds is a joy. \n\nThings like boosting my battery in moments with the super fast charger is a bonus, as is being able to give by watch a boost and i have taken some great pics but my top four for me are the most important. Love it.",
            "Amazing phone just!just had for a week still exploring the features but I've always been a samsung phone user,definitely love it.",
            "The Galaxy S20 Ultra is phenominal to say the least, that is even with the few issues that it has but lets be honest nothing can be perfect although the S20 Ultra tries. Through the past few months I have found that the S20 Ultra performs as expected but sometimes it cam be quite frustrating. The camera can take stunning pictures but it could load quicker and I find sometimes that it tries to hard to create a wow factor with processing, this can mean you miss the scene you wanted to capture. Another annoying feature with the camera is the burst shot mode, in all other Samsung phones you held the take picture button and you would take burst shots, now everytime you take a video instead. The 8k video looks crystal clear and video is amazing but can lose focus far too easily and can take a bit to re-focus again making you miss what you were trying to capture. I imagine with updates this can be improved. The android interface works seamlessly... I have only had a couple of glitches but after update patches these seem to have been resolved. The S20 Ultra does take some getting used to if you have not had such a large screen before which is perfect for watching all your favourite shows/films/youtube...etc and the quality of the resolution is remarkably good. I find that sometimes when in call the phone will randomly mute/hold the call, this appears to be an issue with the optic sensor that detects when you are in call a not only myself but a couple of friends have the same experience, which can get frustrating so would be good if Samsung could sort that out, after all the S20 Ultra is a mobile phone first and everything else is a secondry bonus. Overall it is brillant package and performs really well, just could do with some fine tweeks here and there",
            "I am really enjoying my Samsung S20 Ultra, it is smooth and fast and the display is awesome with lots of good features. However I feel the battery dies too quickly on 120hz refresh meaning I struggle to enable it for normal day to day use. If the battery could last longer on 120hz the phone would be perfect, but I'm sure you guys are working on this.",
            "I have found the Samsung S20 Ultra to lag a lot. Internet pages freeze a lot and have to be force closed and restarted. This is using a variety of connections and browsers so the only common denominator is the phone.\nThe fingerprint recognition is also quite poor. I have found it to be easier and faster if I use the PIN entry to unlock it.\nI am actually very disappointed in this phone. Not what I expected from a flagship device especially from Samsung.\nI stopped using them a few years ago due to issues with their S5 phone and have since used HTC, LG and Huawei and I honestly think that they worked better than my S20 Ultra currently does.\n\nSorry Samsung of you didn't expect a review like this. Seriously considering selling it and getting a 'normal' priced phone.",

            "I love everything about the phone, the size is just right",
            "the camera rattles when not in use. Also when on the phone the screen doesn't always stay black and you end up pressing buttons when on the phone. Alot of money",
            "Really didn't like this phone as it is too big & clumpy.",
            "Love everything about this phone but it doesn't support WatsApp so it doesn't give me notifications for messages which is very inconvenient!",
            "great phone first samsung in 4 years all the features you could ever want, fast, responsive, and user friendly. camera is good 100x zoom not really usable unless you can anchor the phone, but overall good",
            "A great phone, easy to use being a previous Samsung user.",
            "I think this phone was overhyped. Camera not good when zoomed in. Probably the least excited I've been to upgrading to a new phone.",
            "This phone is as good as everyone's been saying. The camera is the best I've experienced on a mobile. Had plenty of features as you would expect. The price may be a tad high but you are getting the flagship of the Samsung range.",
            "It's a fantastic phone and very quick the only thing that's let's the S20 Ultra down is the camera when it's on full zoom it's very wobbly and hard to focus",
            "Seen the hype for this phone,, in reality its no better than the s8+ I had. Camera OK but nothing special. Dissappointed  with myself  that I'm stuck  with  it for 3 years",
            "The phone is amazing.  So fast with all apps . The only down side is there is no 3.5mm Jack plug . So you now have to get a twin type c adaptor so that you can charge your phone and use wired headphones.  On the whole I love the phone , just bring back the 3.5mm Jack plug socket.",
            "The screen is nice , clear and bright. Some game graphics really stand out! The camera is great but the 100* zoom on the camera takes getting used to, at the start i soon learnt to rest the camera on something steady to get a good shot.. In general use the high megapixel sensor comes into its own, a zoomed shot at say 20* zoom then zoom again in the picture for the final result. Beautiful cololurs and detail, i,m very happy with my shots! Performance is great, battery life3 good but as with all phones, the more you use it the quicker it goes down, especially if watching films and streaming. In general use the battery lasts all day and sometimes 2, which is good enough for me.\nAll in all another great product from Samsung....does anyone else make phones?",
            "Personally, I found the phone too big for me, the camera quality is poor, battery life was also poor, I sent it back,",
            "I've had every galaxy since the S2, note 4, note 8, note 10 and this S20 Ultra is just incredible. Innovative and just the pinnacle of technology.",
            "The samsung s20ultra is an excellent phone.  The camera and zoom is amazing and the battery so far is lasting longer than my previous samsung phones.",
            "its a good phone but, I don't see any great leaps from my S8plus. The camera is a pain in to get decent photos from. It regularly slows down whilst playing games. I have loads of trouble with signal from the two networks I have in the phone. Not worth the money.",
            "For a phone that promised so much the camera is bang average. The OS is really amazing, smooth transitions and lovely quality. But the camera is a pure let down and making me regret buying on pre order. The notch on the back is really bad and the huge 100x zoom is so pixelated it's unreal. \n\nOverall I wish I never went from a P30pro to this phone. Now I will be tied down until another phone is released. Brilliant",
            "Good phone, excellent screen. Mediocre battery.\nPerformance in  gaming not great. Camera is good, apart from the auto focus.",
            "Not the huge differences I thought to be honest. Camera good.\nAlso, I have a tiny bubble behind screen, which shouldn't happen.",
            "Love this phone battery and camera are so good had it about 2/3 weeks and no problems, there's one think I wish you got with phone's now and thats the choice of a phone cover you spend so much on a phone it should at least come with one.",
            "Great screen qualiity, finger print sensor can be a bit slow and I think the exynos processor let's it down unfortunately.",
            "Its a good phone but the 100 x zoom is awful and grainy. All other features are great.",
            "love the phone obviously the camera and 100x zoom is not quite as depicted in advertising but it is a great improvement over the s10",
            "I bought this phone mainly for the camera as I find the best photo opportunities are usually missed because I didn't have my DSLR. The 100x zoom is useless, only use able upto 30x on a good day, but  the rest of the lenses are excellent. My favourite being the ultra wide which I used to take the photo below. One thing that does let it down though is the fact you can only use pro mode with the main lens. \n\nBattery life is good, I get a whole day of use in lockdown which is a lot of screen time.\n\nEverything else is good too, no complaints really.",
            "phones amazing. Only issue i have is due to the camera protruding so much if you dont have a case designed to protect the camera its easily scratched/damaged",
            "I like the pin hole camera so watching a film is almost full screen. \nLong battery life, loud speakers with bass. \nI would compliment this phone with the Samsung Case with stand for the ultimate experience. The only downfall is when you use the 120 hz refresh rate, it drains out the battery that it doesn't last for the whole day but it looks beautiful when scrolling up and down.",
            "The phone had to be replaced twice due to the WiFi not working. I have given the phone back and will not receive a replacement as Samsung has stopped making the top spec model anymore, with no explanation.  Very disappointed. I have no issue with the features, etc, and was very much looking forward to using the phone.  I now have a different device as it was not possible to supply me with the phone I had bought.",
            "I'm very disappointed with the camera, I purchased the phone with the idea of a good camera but it doesn't auto focus very well.. it also stalls very easily and reboots, will be popping into a store when I'm able to.",
            "Great phone. Really food camera and features. A few small issues like the ringer volume automatically turns itself up from silent randomly which started occurring since the last software update.\n\nJust too much money to be spending on a handset but this kind of price seems to be the norm nowadays if you want the latest phone.",
            "so as a whole the screen is great, usability is easy and friendly, the super fast charge is perfect, the camera takes some amazing photos.....well thats if you don't zoom over 20x. The camera which was the big selling point so the s20 ultra mislead customers into believing it is more capable than what it actually is. The software is buggy failing to auto zoom in quite a few cases. Ive also found that whilst browsing the Internet it can freeze up regularly(easily solved by pressing the home button and then clicking back online) but annoying still.",
            "Easy to use pictures amazing \nWould recommend it to ant one looking to change phone",
            "I like the size and the features.  I would like to be able to change the background colour of all messages though",
            "couple of little thing let it down the volume buttons were hit and miss (could be the individual phone) bit pricey",
            "I really thought this would have the wow factor I had the s9 plus to be honest only thing In proved is camera I thought more font styles more apps that not available on s9 plus more technology too but its the same as s9 plus except camera",
            "The phone looks and feels great at first looks  the cameras are good for a phone of this quality.  The biggest problem I have found is the battery it drains very quickly,  I also have a Samsung galaxy s8+ on that phone I can go on Facebook for a few hours then play a game again for a few hours and still have enough battery power for the next couple of days not with the S20 ultra.  I Have stuck with Samsung for years well over 15 to 20 years i am stuck with this one for 2 years if the next top phones battery is not improved I will be seriously considering another make like Huawei",
            "I find the screen is nice the camera is brill and the sound is louder than the s9",
            "Vivid graphics, great sound. Love the camera, the zoom too. Getting better and better every year",
            "Build, speed, quality and usability of this S20 ultra are a step up above the competition. \n\nCameras are amazing but please understand with zoom levels and sensors like these you need to work this phone like a camera, point and shoot works great but to get the very best like life you have to put some effort in and you will be rewarded, richly.",
            "Now its been replaced as the first one I had was faulty worked for just over 24 hours then wouldn't turn on. I find the phone to be great. Is quick responsive and a great camera",
            "not had a chance to have a good rummage on the S20 ultra 5G, but what I've experienced so far is utter brilliance",
            "this phone has a lot of great features camera for one is brilliant.\nI don't use the 120 refresh rate as it uses the batterys far too much.\nThe one thing that could do with updating is the space zoom. Although it is really good when you do the full 100 zoom it isnot that great. Works OK areound 70.\nBrilliant screen size. Seems massive to start with but after a day or 2 you get used to it",
            "100x space zoom is a gimmick so is the 8k video recording camera is a nightmare at focusing even after several updates and the exynos chip is just uneceptable considering other countries get superior snapdragon ship which boosts performance of the phone what makes it worst they don't even pay extra for it really disappointed",
            "The phone is all I expected as I had S10 previous and I like it",
            "I love how they changed the advert where the zoom went right upto the mans face in the balloon, to a more realistic distance, because the 100x zoom is awful",
            "I absolutely love the speed and design of this phone and I would recommend it to anybody.\nI also love how great the camera is on the phone.",
            "Camera and overall performance are amazing. 120hz display just makes it even better.",
            "its a amazing photos and very good and easy to use",
            "it's a fantastic device, just love Samsung overall, my next step is the watch, great service",
            "most of the phone things work as they should but the camera could do with a bit more software updates",
            "didn't like it at all just the same as everyone samsung phone. And the zoom doesn't work as it did on the TV advert  sent it back after a day. Massive waste of money...",
            "I love the new camera features on this device the simplicity of all functions and the new galaxy ear buds too. What makes it more better is that it is also on 5g so no time to lose! Still learning some other features and functions  but as usual Samsung delivers on top 100%",
            "I love the camera and speed of phone is great.\nScreen resolution is much much better thrn others in the market.\nOnly 1 complain finger print scanner is not fast .",
            "full screen videos in superb detail .photos in clear crisp detail and not a bad zoom either .large camera area on back look a bit of an eyesore but i can live with that . feels a little on the heavy side so a good case i feel is a must for protection , all in all a good all rounder",
            "I love the phone especially the camera after the latest update. My only issue is the phone gets warm and it sometimes effects the brightness of the display.",
            "worth the price. \nColourful, natural screen\nJust enough new features\nGood audio",
            "the mobile is great excellent features but bit disappointed on the battery life only last 3 days",
            "I love my new ultra for the speed and long battery life. The camera is a bit of a letdown especially the x100 zoom",
            "its a really good phone with a really good feel to it, its very easy to use and the battery lasts alot longer than my previous phones",
            "lovely photos, however not much else has changed except the double monthly bill",
            "I’ll keep this short as I have now sold the phone ..... dynamic range poor,auto focus very poor even with the updates you pushed out,night mode on anything but the main sensor useless,8k @24 and the crop it had was just a gimmick 100x space zoom should have been branded 10x and the exenos990processor is no match for the snapdragon 865 despite what you say",
            "I absolutely wish I'd just gone for t he S20+ tbh, anything over 20x zoom and it's not really very good. Should've just bought a Huawei",
            "looks and feels high quality,  excellent features especially the camera, long battery life and intuitive to use, the perfect phone",
            "love everything but the speaker lets it down.\ngreat phone good alrounder",
            "to many features to mention, the camera's are mind blowing, super fast and slick, quiet simply the best phone I've ever owned",
            "awesome phone sleek feel and couldn't be faster when it comes to processing (and I use it for mobile gaming)  my main issue comes from a 'flashing' pixel. It could be forgiven if it was a 1 off, however this is the second S20 ultra with the same issue, in the same place. Again it would be a problem if Samsung actually responded to my issue, but I'm being fobbed off. \nMy other issue is the factory fitted screen 'protector' it certainly isn't and scuffs after 2 days! Get rid of it and buy a glass one. It ruins the feel",
            "Another Samsung phone and a great phone which you would expect. The camera is outstanding and the zoom is on another level.\nAs you would expect very easy to use. \nI got my phone just before lockdown. And its been in constant use listening to my music and audio books. The sound is very good. And along with the ear buds you get another level of sound.",
            "love the feel,  look,  speed, camera, all round excellent phone",
            "The camera, and sheer power and speed, the screen is smooth at 120htz.",
            "I had an iPhone 11 max as part of my upgrade on my contract but became increasingly bored with the Apple format after years of use. After listening to my partner who has used only Samsung since the note 2 and is still using her S8 I sold my iPhone and went with the Galaxy S20 Ultra and I am so happy I have changed. I have used android as part of my working with different contractors but the S20 Ultra is on another level. The camera is fantastic,the size is perfect for me,I like the customisation options and the Samsung cover is perfect. I'm not a power user but I use it for emails and contact with family and Spotify. It looks great in black and the 120hz is awesome. The screen is amazing.",
            "Great phone as always from samsung easy to use and lovley phone",
            "Fantastic phone! Great features and amazing camera!",
            "struggled getting trade in amount advised. Never mind we live & learn",
            "Like the phone a lot.\nFew very annoying issues \n1- camera has focusing issues \n2- battery does not last as long as iPhone. \n\nThinking of moving to iPhone after being with Samsung for last 7 years",
            "I am 100% the android user and for the last 7 years + have had galaxy models. Every time the new features impress me but with ease to transfer from my previous (s9 plus) it makes the transition much better. The size is a little bigger than my last but is manageable and still fits in my running band no problem, maybe not great on pockets, but no large phones are. It came with a form of screen protector which is good but recommend buying one for the camera. I live that the screen is full display only taken up by the front camera. The fact there isn't a notification light is good if you want to spend less time on your phone, like me. I've only used the camera a little so far, but the zoom is great! I nought a wireless charger as the charger did not reach from plug to bedside but I prefer it as I have a watch too.",
            "I've had each of the new galaxy phones now for the past 5 or 6 years and this one is a good phone.was a little bit disappointed by the camera which samsung used as a major selling point for this phone.To be fair I should of stayed with my 10+",
            "There's so much good about this phone... But I have to say how disappointed I am too, more so than I am happy with this device.\nAnd its to do with Samsung selling this device at such a premium price tag for less than premium internals in the UK. Our devices are slower, less effecient and more power hungry than the US and South Korean S20 Ultras and its not acceptable. \n\nThe space zoom, is MASSIVELY over processed, so the details you see in the view finder end up a blurry mess once the photo is taken. \nThe auto focus is terrible. Takes the many seconds to focus on objects and cannot focus on close subjects... Not talking mm from the phone, but a fair few cm - something my S9+ could do before. \nThe ability to zoom is great and up to 10x it is very useful. However, it sometimes takes way too long to get the telephoto camera lenses to work! And the shift between the two cameras is NOT subtle at all. I thought all these cameras worked together to give you a smooth camera experience?? If I remember the keynote correctly, they're all supposed to be on and working together - that's what 'Single Take' does, so why not the normal camera mode? And why is there no option for MP? Literally all phones before this, you can change the MP count from 12MP, to 9 to 6 to even 2. \nThis, there's only 108MP or 12? What's the point of having these massive numbers if you can't tweak it how you want? \nQuick share, it's only compatible with a very few select Samsung devices.\nThe 120hz display is a gimmicky feature that doesn't offer much but battery drain. It looks good for about a minute before your eyes get used to it and it's not worth the battery drain. Added to this, is the fact that NO 3rd party apps support 120fps, mainly, in this case. Games. \nThey're NO games that Samsung has allowed to be compatible with 120fps. None. Pointless feature until Samsung enables it.... The Asus ROG phone II supports all 120fps games on the Play Store, how is it Samsung supports none of them? Why have a Game Launcher that can set games to Max FPS and it doesn't actually work? \n\nThe Quality of the display is amazing! As it is expected from Samsung, and is the main reason for buying this phone.\n\nI love Samsung devices, and have a whole Galaxy of them! But this S20 Ultra (Exynos/UK version) is nothing short of disappointing. And I would not recommend paying full price for this device. With my trade in, I thankfully am not paying full price. Also Black and Grey, are the only colour options?? WHY? After last years huge spectrum of colours, I was so looking forward to maybe getting a red, or blue colour but... Again, just another disappointment to add to the list. Albeit a tiny one. \nI'm hoping Samsung learn from this, we're not second rate customers and we all deserve the best, not just the US, South Korea and China.",
            "Camera by far the best feature and battery lifes good",
            "It's pretty much the same as simular models excluding the camera which is a better spec. The battery life is awful",
            "The S20 Ultra is beyond compare, it's processing power is phenomenal as is the camera. The design and weight is perfectly balanced and the super fast charging upgrade charges my phone even faster than any phone I have had previously including the s10+.\nI would thoroughly recommend anybody who wants to upgrade to the S20, to take out the ultra version, you will not disappointed.",
            "The phone in incredible. 120hz display is amazing. 108mp camera is amazing when it actually focuses. And the exynos is inferior in many ways to the snap dragon 865.",
            "Love this phone had no issues with it, screen quality is immense and picture quality is amazing, happy customer",
            "If you value the camera on your smartphone then look no further than the S20 ultra. It takes the most stunning pictures and the details are second to non. Simply put, the best smartphone camera on the market today.",
            "This is the best phone I've ever owned, ive had most of the top phones across brands and this by far beats the lot, the speed, camera, usability and the aesthetics!!",
            "It's a top specs mobile phone. All best quality. Despite few glitches here and there, all good.\nCamera is a new implementation so it may have some issues with autofocus. But it happens when company is a pioneering in this feature. \nOverall absolutely brilliant device.",
            "First-Camera still has major issues hit and miss and this is coming from someone who has bought every Samsung always...\nSecond-Uk exynos Version inferior to snapdragon and we still pay premium money,This will be the last Samsung device in my household unless they change this.\n\nAll in all !! very underwhelmed and embarrassing to be honest!!",
            "Love the phone although I couldn't get the 512gb for love nor money even though I'd ordered it, so Samsung let me down there. Screen is the bomb, pictures are good although have issues with the focus sometimes. Also suffer from the screen freeze when web browsing sometimes which is a pain, never had that issue with my note 9.",
            "The phone i needed in my life easy to use, amazing quality camera, fast, happy with all features. The only thing I did not like that much was price, but I really needed to upgrade so spend that much and won't need to upgrade for few years for sure",
            "I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S9+ dual sim with 256 gb memory. I expected the upgrade to be better than the S9+ But am quite disappointed that I paid so much for a phone that is not much different and has a lot less storage space. I buy the Samsung phones for the cameras and thought this would be fantastic but I’m yet to be wowed. The S9 took great photos, as does this but for the money I expected better. Some voice calls have also been scrambled. I am hoping that further software updates will improve the phone but It could be the end for me and Samsung.",
            "all in all I love the phone being able to use smart share and still have full use of the phone is fantastic the display is great the camera is fantastic only limited really buy Internet speeds but thats not the phones fault its the network you're connected to the main drawback is the lack of a headphone jack not being able to use headphones while charging is a pain yes you can get Bluetooth buds or an adapter but for a phone called ultra having less versatility than its predecessor is odd and it wouldn't hugely impact the design of the phone to keep it but as I said otherwise its a fantastic phone my wishlist item for future phones tho would still be to have an IR blaster",
            "The phone is sluggish ,apps not running smooth (60-120Hz ,after restarting still  slow) ,I also have s8 and  that phone  appears to be faster than the s20 ultra.",
            "I love the features of my S20 Ultra! The photo quality is amazing and the phone itself is quick.\nThere is one small rattle when you run/shake the phonw which is the image stabiliser as it stops when camera is open, which is odd as never had that before on a samsung device.\nMy phone has developed a touch vibration when it is sitting on the side not being used which i am yet to factory reset to see whether it goes away.\nThe phone is amazing and i wouldnt change it for any other of the s20 devices or another brand. Perfect other than the small quibbles.\nI was worried about it being so large but i quite preferit now im used to it...",
            "As a long time Samsung user ( Since my D900) the S20 ultra was an obvious upgrade from my S10 plus, The display is Amazing and the camera produces great pics,Although to be brutally  honest the 100x space zoom is definitely  a useless gimmick,the quality of usable pics are questionable and disappointing above around 30x .I have experienced the phone getting warm and the battery life is not as long as expected,I gather from reviews and forums that this is due to Europe  getting the inferior and more power-hungry Samsung Exynos processor. Also sometimes whilst using the phone it freezes whilst scrolling through content ( despite my having the 512gb storage and 16gbram model, )Again other users are having the same issues and some have resorted to factory reset to give temporary cure,Inever experienced such issues with my S3,S5,S7,S9 or S10 plus. I am a bit disappointed  if I am honest. I keep my phone up to date with updates as soon as they are released but freezing is still an issue. The Freezing whilst scrolling ,Overheating,And not as expected battery life prevents me from giving the phone a 5 Star review.",
            "Bad battery and the camera wasn't any good for the price we pay. Should sell the Snapdragon version in every country",
            "Love the screen, high refresh rate is a must have. Camera notch is almost unnoticeable. Main negative is the camera bump on the back tho, i don't wear a case and it sticks out so much that it has numerous scrapes all over it.",
            "outstanding features it has specially camera.\nAnd speaker are amazing",
            "Having had Samsung Galaxy phones since the Galaxy 5 you come to know what to expect from Samsung and this does not disappoint. All the usual quality features run smoothly and quicker than before. The screen isn't too big despite being their biggest (apart from the note range), the feel is premium and little extras like when selecting an option in settings, it feels like you've slid the bar not just pressed the screen are a nice addition to this range. Then there is of course the camera, once again Samsung don't disappoint and the zoom is fantastic. Upto 30x it is crystal clear, anything over this and you need a steady hand but if you get that then you can capture some amazing shots. The other side is the 8k video, in the right light you can really tell the quality in every shot, and the single shot camera mode will help you capture the best picture everytime.",
            "very easy to use. Love the camera. I have used samsung phones for last 10 years. This is not my favorite but very close to favourite. Only downside is earphone plug. It is the same port for both charger and earphones. Other than that this is very good phone.",
            "Wish I had never bought this phone as a screen freezers have all the time , and the camera is not as good as made out ,very disappointed in the performance wish I  had my S8..",
            "Great looking phone, good camera features, but what’s the point of 100x zoom when the clarity of the picture looks like you’ve zoomed into a bowl of porridge, good advanced features on the phone but is ruined by the battery consumption, the phone doesn’t last 48 hours untouched on standby, it’s not even my main phone, have barely any apps installed on it for background usage, yet battery power dissipates on 0 to no use..",
            "Great phone but the Samsung keyboard and message app needs to have the Google assistant built in. Also I hear Google messages will be encrypted soon so the Samsung message app needs to implement that. Please give all features to Samsung messages that Google messages has.",
            "Great phone, very easy to use and customise. Fantastic screen quality and connectivity.",
            "Returned the phone after 3 days! Overheated and became laggy. Really wanted to get away from Apple but I’m afraid this isn’t the phone I’ll be doing it with! Why Europe has to suffer with the  Exynos chipset when other countries get the snapdragon is beyond me! If your not going to make them equal (can deny it all you want but the Exynos variant is just an inferior product) then don’t make two versions! Back to the iPhone it is! Luckily I never sold it in the first place. Won’t be purchasing another Samsung whilst we are clearly been given an inferiority product here in the UK!",
            "Love the camera on this phone, its a great upgrade on my previous S10. The photos it produces are amazing.",
            "I bought this model because it should support hi fidelity music unfortunately when I connect to amplifiers I have checked few the is cracking it was the case with my previous phone 10 Samsung  until software update after almost a year so please do something about that. Thanks",
            "The screen is stunning and the size is great for consuming media. The cameras (despite the autofocus issues) are great and I have got some amazing shots from them. The only issue is the terrible processor (Exynos) that lets the phone down on both performance and battery life. If I could swap to the Snapdragon varient this would be a true Ultra device.",
            "The Samsung galaxy S20 Ultra is a fantastic phone,it has some great features on it and the speed in which the apps open up is really fast... the camera absolutely brilliant the detail of the photos is simply stunning.",
            "I upgraded from the S10 model.\nWas it worth it?  Not really. I now own a S20 Ultra and a few weeks in I am not sure what all the fuss was about.\nThe S10 was everybit as good.",
            "Best phone I've ever had the only thing I'd want more of is battery life but it lasts just shy of the day so I can't complain to much =O but as for the features man its a powerhouse but I did go from a 5 to the 7 to the 9 to this bad boy its soooo goood. Great work as always samsung!",
            "I've always wanted a larger phone. I tend to use my phone mostly to watch videos, browse the Internet, take photos and listen to music. The larger screen is perfect for video watching and browsing the Internet, and almost more importantly I can do them at the same time with split screen- a feature I use everyday. What sold me on the S20 ultra rather than S20+ was the camera. I love to take photos and while I thought my S8 took great photos, seeing the S20 ultra had a MASSIVELY better camera (9 times higher MP) I was set. So far I've had no issues with the phone other than some bubbles under the screen protector I put on badly (BTW the phone comes with a preinstalled screen protector so don't do what I did and take it off to test if there is one...). In my opinion the main thing that proves how good the phone is- it managed to get my Apple-loving sister to buy herself one after just looking at it (of course I didn't let her hold it ;)...)",
            "love it all what else can I say but you need to try it.",
            "Great phone with everything I need and more, brought this phone for the camera and it hasn't disappointed! I am now the go to armature photographer!",
            "I love the phone and everything about espically the speed at which it works and operates at. Id highly recommend getting one",
            "Big numbers in spec details fooled people into buying these expensive devices. It also disappointing getting Exynos instead of Snapdragon paying same or even more. x100 Zoom is not something you can use. Battery last longer on my old s9 +. It also has autofocus and overheating problems",
            "so ive never dropped it or has it got any damage what so ever but the rear camera glass has developed a hair line crack in it",
            "I love the camera quality and the 100x zoom and also the response time of the screen",
            "I have had most of the galaxy flagship series and have found the S20 Ultra to be the best so far. The smoothness of switching between apps, picture in picture and sound quality are amazing. The only downside I have found is not being able to use standard earphones / being able to charge while using supplied earphones, if this is going to be a permanent feature I would suggest providing a adapter so this is possible",
            "as always easy to use, camera is fantastic, thumb print recognition doesn't seem to be as precise as the s10+ but all in all a great product",
            "I changed from Apple iPhone for a Samsung phone a while ago. It took a bit of getting used to but I have never regretted the move. The S20 is the best Samsung Mobile without a doubt, will never change. Battery life, screen, camera and what camera. Get machine",
            "love the battery life, always get all day. Love the screen quality and size, and 120hz is a must now in any phone i buy from now on. 100x zoom is pretty useless but 6x and high resolution are great. In 108mp take a picture, and then zoom in the quality is outstanding. In summery great phone, dont get for 100x zoom.",
            "the camera is the best I have ever seen on any phone a true media centre but thats to be expected from Samsung",
            "After seeing advert of s20 ultra, I decided to buy it.\nMainly because of advanced camera. \nIt's good,but not as good as advertised. \nAlso the Exynos processor makes it a bit laggy and slow.\nSo,after using the phone for two months, I decided  to sell it and get a different one.",
            "I have been looking forward to get this phone and the wait was worth while.\nThe camera is as good as the press say. The single take mode is really groundbreaking and the quality exceptional. \n\nThe build of the phone is very good too and easily beats the S10 5g.",
            "The phone is such a slick looking phone, the speed and design of features are next to non.  Only problem I have had is trying to change notification tones and it still stays on the default one set by samsung.",
            "Great features the best Samsung i ever had out over the samsung s range",
            "Could not be happier with the phone so far. I have been a Samsung user for the last 4/5 years and have always been haapy. The ultra however is a real stand out model. The camera is fanstasic along with the user interface.  I have only had the phone a week or 2 and many other functions to utalise but very much looking forwards to what else this phone can do.",
            "love this phone,  third Samsung I have owned, it may improve itself, but the volume keys can become a little sticky in that they may need pressing a few times to  operate,  otherwise a fantastic device.",
            "Decided to upgrade to the Ultra 5G on the immenent birth of my 1st grandson, to makesure I could capture pictures of him from birth in the best quality. The Ultra 5G has not let me down and everyone is delighted with the photos I've taken.",
            "now first of all, yes it is as fast as you think. It is crazy fast. The camera is amazing the 100x is definitely a gimic. However there's a few small thing I don't like. One, fingerprint sensor is slow and doesn't work all the time. Two, the camera stabiliser rattles. Three, it is scary slippy. If you're buying this phone remember it is already very expensive so you might aswell go full send and get the 512gb version as you then get 16gb of ram with is INSANE for a phone. It is hands down the fastest phone I have every used. The screen is amazing especially os 120hz mode. As ever the Samsung ui is nice. Its just enough to be different but still as smooth as stock android. If you need a phone to do whatever this is the phone for you. This phone will do everything you need it to do and you will.never even use 50% of the performance.",
            "Very similar handset to the S9 +. Camera noticeably better.  Battery life and performance very simlar. Unless your old phone is damaged or not performing as good as you would expect its not worth the upgrade and extra expense for the s20 ultra.",
            "As usual with Samsung, you can't fault the display.\nThe fast charging on this is really good, and is fast considering how large the battery is! \nThe 10x hybrid zoom is a.game changer, and as expected, the 30x & 100x zoom is just gimmicky. You're better off just taking your usual snaps and cropping/zooming in on those. \nI'm pretty much getting a full day on the battery with medium/high use (30hz refresh) at max resolution. \n\nThe haptics feel really nice on this phone, and the response to your touch is really good, and I don't even have the 60hz enabled. \n\nI've not used 5G yet, as it's not in my area. \n\nNow for the bad. \nFor the shots I do (close up of phone repairs) I prefer the S10+ the focal depth just makes the edges of what I'm snapping slightly out of focus, where as the 10+ was absolutely bang on! \nAgain, with normal shots, it's amazing, so I would consider the other devices if you're doing alot of closeups. \n\nThe finger print reader is still bad! Works good on any app that requires fingerprint, but unlocking the phone, more times than not, I still have to use the pin code. And I have the same thumb print saved as 3 different fingers thinking it's the way I'm pressing sometimes? \n\n\nFor the price of this device, I wasn't expecting these silly niggles, especially the fingerprint reader which performs as bad as the S10+ \nI would only recommend this phone if you want the decent 10x hybrid zoom. Everything else, you're better off with the 20+ or even the 10+ which would be a big saving.",
            "Sleek modern design and great camera but overall I prefer the Note phones.",
            "The only problem I have with the phone is the camera at x100..\nInstead of a nice sharp image, it captures like a \"cartoon\" picture",
            "Great camera and very good phone. Very easy to use works very fast . Very clear pictures and videos. Little bit pricey would like it to have been cheaper.",
            "where do I start , awful camera, misleading adverts about quality of zoom lenses photos,  battery life is poor, over heats when in use, and the final rip off , here in the UK we get exynos chip which is completely out performed by the snap dragon chip in the US model AND we pay MORE for it !! Disgusting!",
            "The camera is brilliant and just can't say any thing bad about the phone",
            "Omg, where to begin. This is hands down the best phone out there right now. \nThe cameras are immaculate and the zoom quality is really amazing it will shock you. \nThe faster screen quality and hz upgrade really makes all the difference. \nThe volume is the loudest I've ever had on a phone and the audio is clear even without the Dolby Atmos feature enabled.",
            "I feel years and years of innovation has led to this device, and I couldn't be happier with the results. It is very fast, very flashy and very cool to show off to people. The 120Hz display is a beauty, and it's nice and big with minimal bezels. It is an absolute beast of a device!\n\nMy only gripe is that the Europe version comes with the inferior Exynos chip, instead of the Snapdragon, but it is not very noticeable.",
            "would be a 5 star review but the 100x zoom feature is nothing as advertised secondly the battery life when not in use isn't brilliant at all",
            "An amazing phone with amazing features. Everything about this phone is brilliant except for the camera. Huge delay in the picture being taken from the moment you click the shutter button ensures you always miss that precious moment, \nthe focus issue still remains and makes this phone a disaster.\n\nI wish Samsung upgrade programme gave the option of upgrading to Note 20.",
            "There are many reasons I can go through to explain why this is the best phone I've ever owned, but ill focus on the key points. Firstly the camera. It has been a UPS of the phone and advert and promotions focus on the space zoom feature. Although this is impressive it takes away from the fact this phone takes amazing photos in general terms. Point and shot and you end up with an amazing photo every time. Second feature is the battery, I have had each of the Samsung galaxy phones since they realeased the s6 and this by far has the best battery for my usage. I work for Dixons and we use workplace and it takes so much energy from phones to use it. This phone lasts the whole day, with out fail! Finally and probably my favorite feature of this phone has to be the screen. Its 120hz refresh rate makes a massive difference to the whole user experience of the phone, making it smooth and sleek. Its big, bright and beautiful!",
            "The best phone i have used. Amazing display. Amazing camera. Never slows down.",
            "Love the new features of the camera and the zoom, the clarity of the pics",
            "this is a massive phone but still very nice im enjoying using it and love my free watch made the phone worth getting",
            "I bought this as an upgrade to a S9+, is it worth it .... maybe not, but I change my phone every 2 years.  It still suffers a pause or two when browsing.. still works as a phone. So I can't go overboard regarding the phone. The camera is better but if you want to take serious pictures buy a good compact digital camera.",
            "I love the large Screen, definitely took some getting used to, the 100x zoom is a good feature, however very gimmicky, and takes a poor quality photo when used.\n The rear glass to the phone very prone to scratches, and is covered in scratches despite being in a case since the day I received the phone. It is a huge shame that the autofocus on this phone does not work properly and by the sounds of it will not be fixed through a software update. The selling point of this phone was its camera, so for the zoom to be in poor quality and auto focus not to work properly is a real letdown, considering the cost of the phone too.\n\nThe weight of the phone is quite a shock and the bulging camera is not aesthetically pleasing.\n\nDespite this I do love the size of the screen, the 128mhz screen, although its a slight letdown that its not use able in WQHD, hoping an update will make this possible in the future. The battery life is excellent too compared to my previous Galaxy S series devices.\n\nThe is the fourth of the galaxy s series phones that I have owned, and ill be honest there hasn't been much improvement since the Galaxy S8 in my opinion. I will not be purchasing another galaxy device until I see a real improvement in design and camera quality",
            "I got this phone on the basis of the 100x zoom and the advert the one with the hot air balloon. Well every thing else about the phone is OK but even the camera at normal and up to 30x but anything over is very blurred and hard to focus no way can you hold the phone and zoom to 100x and tack a pic as clear and as nicely as what the advert says so zoom 100x is a big let down for me",
            "I absolutely love the phone the screen is amazing crisp and very clear. The processor is definitely faster than my old s10 games run smother and load quicker. The camera is better than the s10 but you would be hard pressed to actually spot this would be great if the super slow mo would be able to do longer video as you nearly always miss what you want to slow mo , and there really is no point for the space zoom (100x zoom) as you can't hold phone perfectly stills is always fuzzy even in my dji phone gimbal on a tripod the quality of pictures just reminded me of my first ever phone with a camera should of put more time in to  other aspects of the camera. But having said that that is the only thing I am disappointed with , and seeing as I don't use a computer I do everything on my phone and that is the only fault I can find with it I believe it is a very good phone",
            "none it the worst Samsung I have had \nBattery keep no charge",
            "At first I was unsure about the battery life however I find it lasts up to 3 days, depending on usage. The camera is excellent, the screen quality is outstanding. It’s what I have come to expect from Samsung Galaxy phones, of which I have had most model’s",
            "I think the device is brilliant, quick and best camera I've seen on a mobile phone, and the clarity on screen watching better than its one before it the only let down is the battery hasn't got better in my opinion",
            "Great phone! Some little bits need doing for the camera as the focus plays up a little but other than that, its perfect",
            "Not enough to justify the price hike over the S10+",
            "So far so good  lots of new features to play with good phone",
            "Great phone, best I've ever had!! Well done Samsung!!!!!",
            "The camera is amazing and takes brilliant shots. Everything just works so easily on the phone",
            "I love wvwryth6anout the phone.....apart from the battery, I know its bigger but if I am on social media in the day on and off by  5pm I am charging it again really frustrating, bit the screen the feel of the handset,are amazing, the look of the phone is stunning and I love the size of the screen. The face unlock is OK the fingerprint is being annoying though!I am converted from apple though and i am enjoying the Samsung experience.",
            "Screens nice, runs fast. Camera too big and phones unbalanced and smashing prone. Already on a refurbished model  as the phone slips and drops easily. Smart switch on initial set up lost me loads of data.\n\nSamsung support couldnt really care less. Not happy with the phone, not happy with the company.",
            "By far the best phone I've own to date the size take a but of getting used to but seriously what a piece of tech samsung have out done themselves with this one",
            "As a samsung flagship the display is the best on the market by far and been android its possible for the phone to be customised to your hearts content. Bad points, poor battery life due exynos chip V Qualcomm alternative, earpiece volume and hands free speaker poor/low, camera not the best compared to others especially as it was pushed so hard in its advertising.",
            "As stated above, I can comfortably say this is the best phone I've used, after coming from the Galaxy Fold. The camera on this phone is truly brilliant, battery life is also brilliant but does take a bit of a hit when using the 120hz refresh rate which is expected. The thing I like most with Samsung phones is you can always learn something new about what the device can do and its the same for this one. After being with Samsung for some years now I can confidently know that each device I get is an improvement upon the last, features, software, specs and usually design constantly gets better. I am already looking forward to see whats in store in the next lineup.",
            "I think Samsung really need to work on themes the current set up is old",
            "Unfortunately, the glass on the camera bubble has cracked. This has affected the camera. It will not take pictures using more than 50 x zoom.\nNot happy.",
            "camera was not up to what was said on the  adverts other than that very good quality phone and I still haven't had my ear buds yet",
            "Everything, is so fast, great pictures, greatest zooming availability, longer battery life, great resolution on screen, to describe the actual phone with one word,,amazing,,",
            "This is a really nice phone, large but not too large.  Easy to use, vary fast and looks good",
            "phone is fast and battery life is brilliant. \nOnly bad thing is auto focus. If you zoom in then picture is terrible.",
            "love the look and feel of the phone, features are top notch. Camera is amazing",
            "I've been a Galaxy user since I first bought an S3.. every year the Galaxy range has been a step up since it's precious.. until this year.. in my opinion the S20 Ultra is the biggest disappointment I've experienced since being a Samsung user.\n\nThe much hyped camera is abysmal, the auto focusing is horrendous, the 100x digital zoom is laughable and basically unusable. I can accept a camera not being much of an improvement from the previous flagship but to be much much worse for a phone with this price tag is completely unacceptable.\n\nMy advise to someone looking to upgrade to this phone, assuming the camera is important, is to stay with your old phone and miss this one out.",
            "grate phone got exalent pics and video and the music volume from it is good",
            "Great phone and fast. Can't make use of 5g where I live yet. Not sure about the camera. Find when I zoom into pictures ive taken the resolution is quite poor. Even when I save in 8k.",
            "First phone was replaced within a few weeks due to call speaker crackles whenever letter S was said, my replacement did it out if the box too and still does. Apparently it's a common thing on Google searches. A flagship phone that can't phone properly is frustrating.",
            "Its a truly beautiful powerful piece of kit expensive though",
            "love the camera and 8k video taking, watch back and take a perfect picture, the zoom function is better, get up close, can lose focus though, apart from that, 10/10",
            "not really a great phone, quiet buggy preferred my s10 plus, phone is nice and fast and takes good pictures but doesn't make up for some of the faults",
            "Felt a bit plastic and buttons are very close together but screen and camera second to none",
            "love all the features of this phone. Great design and amazing camera",
            "the phone itself is good but the charging port and headphone port is little temper mantel",
            "With my new Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra all is going good so far! The battery life is a dramatic improvement from my old Samsung S9 and it is faster at doing stuff (although that may just be because its new and uncluttered). \nWith enough light the camera and the zoom capability is beyond any phone I have ever used. \n\nI wouod highly recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't mind a baby tablet as a phone because this a big phone.",
            "absolutely love this phone, the camera is amazing and the battery life is surprisingly good to match. Not had a single issue with the handset and very pleased with the performance.",
            "overall very good phone I will definitely recommend this phone to anyone want a good phone",
            "Absolutely brilliant phone, camera outstanding but let down because of the camera protruding so far and the surface area of the camera glass. Night time shots are unbelievably good.\nI'm on my second phone because the camera glass cracked  had to fit screen protector on the camera as well as the front.\nOther than that I'm totally satisfied.",
            "so this is my 6th samsung phone. I have stuck with them for a variety of features but especially  the camera. Every time I take a pic, everyone says how amazing it looks.",
            "disappointed really spend lot of money for a phone with issues on camera.!!",
            "ok soo its only rught i guve an honest review . For the past 10 years i have been with samsung and over the years there has been some amazing tech that has only got better . However on the s20 ultra . As good as the 120hz refresh rate is . The main selling point was the camera . However im not overly impressed with it . Yes it has 100x space zoom however when is this zoom needed in everyday life and also you cant even tell what the picture is at full zoom so pointless really . Also i have had this device less than 2 weeks and already im noticing lag !. This is a fairly common issue over the past couple devices released. (S9 plus and s10 plus ) shame really for such an expensive phone . Overall its a great device however im not getting that wow factor atm . I need something that has never been done before to keep me interested l I also have rhe galaxy z flip i wanted to test them both . Yes the flexible screen is insane!!! Buttt. Thats it . And i dropped it and broke the screen within a week . Anyway theres\n my review thanks",
            "I love how it has brains and beauty.   All the power and still looks nice.  And the camer is amazing",
            "Great galaxy s20 ultra nicely for everything from camera to normal use",
            "this is my 4th galaxy and each one is better than the last. Simple to use , great features and the new camera is really amazing",
            "This phone is absolutely amazing.\nThe camera quality is fantastic.\nThe day to day running of the phone is impressive and battery life is really good.\n\nI can't fault it at all.\nGreat purchase.",
            "There is not much I don't like about the samsung s20 ultra great device and a great upgrade from s8",
            "Amazing phone near perfect , the cameras 10/10 , the performance 10/10 , the ease to set the phone up the way you want it 10/10 , as a former note owner the only downside is no S pen .",
            "When i try to unlock the phone is freezing for 1 or 2 seconds",
            "very impressed with the s20 ultra, fantastic camera, phone battery lasts for a couple of days depending on use.",
            "I was a little worried about the exynos version of this phone as I'd read overheating reports etc. Whether I'm lucky or the stories are rubbish but my phone is great. No overheating and the camera and battery are great. And the screen is amazing",
            "The camera is fantastic with its wonderful zoom. Internet freezes at times and its quite heavy but overall a good phone. I don't like the power and volume controls on the same side as I'm always turning the phone off when wanting to turn it down.",
            "Zoom 100 is nothing, everything is blury, lie zoom 10 \nBattery going fast no matter what i use or how\nTotally is pretty good phone..",
            "camera great but phone always freezes when I'm typing on WhatsApp and messenger",
            "see above the phone is just a bigger version of the s9+÷",
            "battery life is very good compared to most modern phones",
            "I always buy new Samsung phone, this S20 ultra is good in high speed performance. Working really faster than computer .\nBut it is lock of camera auto focus, really disappointed me when I spend 1200 on product which is not worth of it. If I had option, I would have kept my S10plus phone.\nAlso weight is too much.",
            "just an all round brilliant phone really quickly looks good camera is good",
            "for the money I was expecting more I mean its a top end device and basically most expensive phone you can buy. I had a p30 pro before this and generally change phones once a year but the camera is on par with that. Sorry but the 100x zoom is terrible whatever condition. Also battery is lacking in terms of holding charge. The thing that annoys me the most is the display that dims so low at times I can't read the screen text constantly having to press power on and off not sure if its a bug or bad device. The pros are big screen which I like and I got the buds plus which are good and hold long charge.",
            "screen size...speed...easy to use....jumped from the s9+ straight to the s20 ultra and so glad I did",
            "The screen is lovely, I use it more like a pocket computer. I only have one issue and that is that I needed to update my wireless charging pad as I fit a sleeve that means my old pad discharged rather than charged the phone.",
            "everything about the phone is great and more. However, with the use of just the USB-C port being the only port available, an adaptor should have been considered to be included to allow for existing aux plugs to still be used as there are still a lot of headphones still useable now being left on the side incompatible.",
            "Great phone more happy with all the features it has and go to using it was easy to set up to",
            "I love the display. Lovely, bright and clear.\n\nCamera, still struggles to take a clear image with issues on the auto focus. I got better pictures front the Note 10+.\n\nBattery life - does the job perfectly. Last as long as I need it to and charges incredibly quickly.",
            "Good size. Fast speed. Bit pricey .samsung are over demanding in the length of review",
            "I simply loved my new galaxy 20 ultra, very easy to manage and loads of useful features!",
            "Best phone ive had ever ive always had samsung mobile & far better than previous versions",
            "love this camera even easier to use and the camera is amazing.  \nWould gave bern better with a stylus pen.",
            "Screen is the best on the market and with that 120hz refresh rate it not only looks amazing it feels it also. \n\nBattery life is so poor and the camera even after the improvements doesn’t focus anywhere nearly as quickly as my Note 10 or IPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nReal shame Samsung persist in sticking the exynos chips in the UK models as it’s so inferior to the snapdragon it’s unreal. Paying the same price as the US but getting half the performance and battery life.\n\nWhat a great shame!!\n\nMine is being returned.",
            "love the new camera and the features available in the camera setting! Love everything I can do on the phone!!",
            "device is slow camera is not as great as advertised you can't get 5G and when you do it doesn't work had to swap the phone as first one didn't work 2nd with same problems",
            "It is a great phone when it works but its battery life plus overheating is annoying. Further to add that it freezes every so often when on chrome or other apps which annoys me the most.",
            "The 120hz refresh rate has to be my favourite feature",
            "So smooth to use. The camera is the best out there.",
            "awesome phone, amazing screen quality. Only con is it is hard to use in 1 hand as soo large, but does have a function to shrink the screen to make this easier.",
            "So coming from OnePlus I was a bit sceptical but not disappointed. I used to be an avid Samsung user some years ago so I had an idea of the quality to expect. Now down to the phone, this thing is big and if your using it without a case I can see you dropping it very soon because it is so smooth and slippy. I was glad to see a screen protector pre fitted and a set of headphones in the box. The camera is pretty amazing the zoom is fantastic and the quality of shots are awesome. The phones speakers are good and loud but I find them a bit tinny at the high volume end I could maybe sort this with the eq though. Battery life, hmm this is whats making me not give 5 stars. The phone arrived with 59% battery charge so the first thing I did was charge it via cable, this took much longer than I am used to compared to my OnePlus but I have yet to try the wireless charging.  Now the battery life is not what I was expecting but I do have the display on 120hz and the vivid setting so this could be draining it more, I have charged it twice and I am already down to 32% and I would class myself as a medium user. \nAll in all good job, just need my accessories  to arrive now.",
            "I love all my Samsung phones and the S20 Ultra is no different. Easy to set up from my previous S7, love the wireless charging, great camera as always. Another hit and keeping me loyal to Samsung :-)",
            "I am loving how quick it is is to my s10 plus. The battery life is fantastic I have still got 40% on the second day.",
            "Always had the Samsung s series from the start, so naturally I upgraded to the s20 5g! \nGreat camera, nice screen but very much let down by the battery life! The phone only lasted half a day. I returned the device for this reason. I expected better after paying so much for the phone. Brought a Redmi note 8 pro.... Camera, not as good and few other minor features but battery life is excellent",
            "I switched from the iPhone 11 Pro Max and although I love the S20+ more, I felt the change in battery life straight away. Samsung Galaxy phones need to improve battery life with their demanding displays, even if it means making the phones heavier.",
            "Samsung have blew all competition out the water with the ultra some reviews say battery is poor I can get a full day on highest power setting easily and camera is amazing although the 100 times zoom is a bit of a marketing hype as once you go over 40 times zoom picture does get distorted as expected but its quite easily the best camera around on a smartphone.",
            "Really good phone. Not cheap but worth it.",
            "I had Samsung ultra now about month, I am absolutely shocked. I used it with all protection screen protector,case . I have not dropped my phone once  but camera side glass looks like its been shot through . Absolutely annoyed with you Samsung as much as I love everything whats inside this phone their seems like a flaw is build quality . Why can't you make a durable screens instead of advertising excellent professional camera behind massive camera lump or otherwise just plain glass. \nThe camera lump sticks out quite far and you can feel is with your fingers in use.",
            "رائع جدا ومتين  لكن بطارية ضعيف بعض شي",
            "amazing phone as usual Samsung is best . I have never changed my device ..always have Samsung",
            "Right were to start, OK its awesome I mean really awesome. The camera is the best out there, and its operating system is just gets better and better. I have been using Samsung since the s3 and they never fail to deliver. So why haven't you got one then?",
            "I love this phone.  is great .  beautiful pictures I highly recommend Samsung S20 Ultra",
            "Performance is excellent, though I wish 5G was more wide spread so I could test the speed, but no complaints so far with everything else :) If I had to be pushed I would like double tap to lock the screen :) please samsung\n\nAnd the quality of the camera is amazing, these are standing from the same location and RAW from the camera :)",
            "Excellent operating and easy to use. Camera takes some beautiful photographs. Very slick.",
            "the camera is a complete let down out of focus, google chrome is a nightmare very hard to close tabs without it opening new ones! And thats when it does not freeze, 5g mobile only 4g coverage in area the mobile data has to be the slowest ever encountered on a samsung phone moved to the s20 ultra 5g from a note 9 i wish i had not done so phones a joke for the price bet samsung are sat laughing while drawing up plans for the next note phone complete rip off",
            "I love the large size of my s20 ultra.and the camera is brilliant,  I just love everything about it",
            "The experience with buying from Argos was just nice and easy from the beginning! The phone is exactly what i wanted and expected. It's features are just AMAZING! Definitelly recommend it to everybody who wants a great smartphone.",
            "Such a gorgeous screen. Camera is great. \nEasy to use and will definitely recommend to anyone!!!",
            "the new exynos chip is very slow and the camera's cant focus and gives blurry images especially around the edges have now returned the device and moving to another brand for the cost of the ultra definitely not as ultra as samsung made out definitely a flop the overall quality is not there definitely needs to be withdrawn and looked into again",
            "Great phone,works well,and fast. Switched from iPhone and was easy to do,and I am liking the way it works. Battery life is amazing!",
            "Very kind of the staff And service will highly recommended my family and friends",
            "two diferent hardware one snapdragon 865 witch is the best!and one exynos 990 witch is to many problem!overheating,mutch slower,poor battery life camera problem focus problem etc...this is terrible for samsung never use again...expensive exynos sh.t..",
            "I have found the S20 Ultra disappointing in the dictation department.  I use texting, almost 98% of the time and dictate all my messages.  Unlike my S9+ that was virtually instant, the Ultra is very slow at taking the dictation and showing it on the screen sometimes 30 seconds or more, in that I have said my sentence, looked at the screen to confirm only having to wait until it appears.  Also, it tends to put capital letters at the beginning of words in the middle of sentences that has no punctuation and you have to keep going back to correct, very frustrating.  5G is not yet in my area so I cannot comment on that aspect.",
            "I  Have just bought this phone and it seems like it is only lost than about 4 hours on a full charge is that correct ?",
            "I've been using S line devices for 8 years and Samsung always manages to deliver the best cell phone to me, I never had any problems with branded devices, samsung you are part of most of my technological life.",
            "had the s20 ultra fir over a month now and the best way to describe my experience is \"epic\"",
            "am cumparat telefonul cu o luna in urma. Este excepțional! Nu regret ca am dat banii pe el!",
            "I bought this about month ago and immediately was amazed of it! Reliability, features, camera and more are great!\nReally happy of this!\nJust need to wait for the 5g networks to come up...",
            "Pre ordered my the s20+ as the features were great. Love the phone but onoy downside is that it is a exynos version. I think it's not fair that we pay the same price but different regions get different performance phone. I hope Samsung make the exynos processor better from next year.",
            "I still remember the Galaxy s1. My first ever phone and i still use Galaxy . My s20 plus it's unreal. I love it . Bring me so much joy!!",
            "I had to buy a new mobile as my galaxy S6 was no longer compatible with my new car Peugeot 3008.\nI have had this phone a week.\nNow I am finding the phone is not compatible with my fitbit versa or my car!!!!!  So annoying  these are all expensive up to date items!!!\nWill be sending it back and will buy an iPhone instead. I never really wanted an iPhone!",
            "Bought this for pre-order online and I'm so disappointed it could have been such a good phone but now it's such a let down. First phone I received I couldn't always make and receive calls and texts and it wasn't my network either as I tried another network too was given a replacement and the same issue persisted which annoyed me a lot and then I read about the camera lens cracking which was the last straw and I have now started a return again this time for a full refund. Didn't even get the chance to observe the battery performance or anything as the phone was such a disappointment right from the off. However I must say the screen does look impeccable. Decided to stick to my current phone unfortunately. Samsung needs to fix up!",
            "Just like to say this phone is so good. Jam packed with cool features. Chosen the cosmic grey.\nCamera and video is quality is so good.\nIt's a monster.\nYes the best in the galaxy.\nWould definitely recommend.",
            "Had this phone for 3 days now and I can only say i made the right decision, the camera is amazing in fact the whole thing is is just great, battery live is fantastic nearly two days of playing with the new toy and still had 10% left. I bought the Plus as I think the Ultra may have been to big and the only extra thing you get is 100x zoom. I would highly recommend this phone , well done Samsung.\nPaul",
            "have always been a Samsung user, and have had a few galaxy phone now, but omg this phone has blown my mind,and is out of this world.",
            "I did not expect the device to be this good, it has blown my expectations out of the water.",
            "I bought this phone the day before it was officially released, so a couple of months ago now.  I agree that it is a great phone, except however for the durability of its screen.  My phone already has dozens of little surface scratches on it which cannot be removed.  I did read on several review sites that the screen was one of best, scratch wise, but for me that hasn't proved to be the case, sadly.  So be warned, you need to keep this phone in a protective case or use a screen protector or something - I'm now very sorry I didn't as it looks awful",
            "Got the S20 as a self present for my birthday.\nSo happy with with : Design, photo/video quality, weight... but most of it : The screen quality ! Everytime I look at my phone I don't regret 1 second my purchase",
            "I pre-ordered my Galaxy S20 Ultra on day one. For some reason I just knew the 512GB would sell out.\n\nI have been amazed at how good this phone is.\n\nTHIS IS A HYPER PERFORMANCE  PREMIUM QUALITY, GORGEOUS FEATURE PACKED PHONE.\n\nSome reviewers have gone into immense depth describing the features of this sensational handset.\n\nI'm not going to go on and on and on. If you want:\n1. The BEST Display\n2. The BEST Cameras on a phone\n3. The BEST SPECS: 5G, 16GB RAM, 512GB ROM,\n     DUAL SIMS, 1TB MICROSDXC EXPANSION, \n     STEREO SPEAKERS, SUPERFAST CHARGING.\nI could go on and on but you get the picture. Nothing on the market now or in the next several months comes close. \n1. New Huawei P40, forget it.\n2. New OnePlus 8 Pro, forget it.\n3. Upcoming Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. Might not \n    even arrive till next year and 5G? If we look at \n    New iPads 2020 models NO 5G on launch?\n\nYou want the best of the best buy the Galaxy S20 Ultra. Could be a long wait for the 512GB though, back orders in the millions..........",
            "Having all the Notes series phone since the 1st model, I bought the S20 Ultra, it was buggy, games were lagging, camera focus, overheating issues. I returned the phone. It's a frigging disaster",
            "It was great. Thought it was really good ************",
            "I think the iPhone 11 would have been a better choice.",
            "No doubt S20 Ultra is one of the best phone in the market now ever built. 100x simply amazing.",
            "I have had this phone since the release date and it marks my 5th flagship Samsung, something I have enjoyed up until now.\n\nThe Ultra has some incredible plus sides - the screen, zoom capabilities and charge time. All of which make the phone fantastic to use day to day as I have come to expect of such a phone from Samsung. However as soon as I start putting demand on the processor via extra refresh rate, WiFi sharing, multitasking movies and browsing... the phone overheats. \nI am used to a warm hand from a phone under demand but the S20 Ultra regularly requires me to put the phone down from discomfort and on several occasions has ceased working entirely. I would like to note that in this state the phone will drain battery quicker than the charger can replace it forcing you to leave it for and hour on a damp cloth to cool.\n\nI always saw this phone as a 'reach for the stars' gimmick of fun features for a premium price; I knew there were going to be some consequences. But Samsung have included a woefully inadequate processor regularly leaving the phone unusable. I will be taking this to me Mobile Network Supplier asking for a downgrade to the S20+ and truthfully can't see myself buying an 'Ultra' level phone again.",
            "Got this phone on the 10th March and I can honestly say it is the best phone I have ever had, you learn something new every day.  The camera is just unbelievable and the speed of the phone is phenomenal. I would recommend the phone to anyone even if you use the fruit based phone.",
            "I had it for a week now. Battery life is pathetic ĺlpĺlpl",
            "Having problems with Wifi. The rest of my devices have consistent 500mb download speeds. On my s20 plus it keeps dropping to 50mb speed and I have to turn the phone off and back on. Not sure if it's a hardware fault or software. upgraded from my s8+.",
            "After paying so much money on my S20 ultra, literally more than the US customers, here in the United Kingdom, disappointment strikes hard, why Exynos processors? It is a great phone, but after being \"cheated\" out of battery life and overall performance behaviour, this will be the last Samsung branded product, at least until equality is brought back. In this very moment, I can't recommend the Samsung Phones while this difference in processing is so obvious. On light colours, even after the update, the main camera loses focus and then when finally you take the shot the colours have a plastic effect, the same foto taken with the selfie camera with no filtering looks normal not taken out of an artificial world. Still hope for a way to go back towards the previous screen, just with swiping from one side to another of the phone. Samsung is advertising the Queens logo, yet Lloyds, one of the oldest banks in the United Kingdom isn't compatible with Samsung Pay. I'm 70% happy with this phone, but at this price, I was hoping for more.",
            "S20 plus Purchased on release. Has the potential to be a great phone however not a day goes by when it doesn't crash. The appears to be no rhyme or reason why, there is no one app that I am aware of the corse it to restart.",
            "I absolutley love this new phone. The features are fantastic and everything runs a lot faster. I love the wireless powershare and being able to use it on the buds aswell. My favourite part is that the fingerprint lock in on the front screen now instead of the back. I feel like i can control it better :) \nThe only feature I miss from the S9 to the S20+ is that it doesnt have the flashing light on the front to let you know that you have a notification. I used to rely on that when my phone was on charge or if I was in the middle of doing something. I could just look at my phone and know if I had a notification or not. I miss it but it doesn't effect on how I use the phone. I just got the go on the lock screen to see any notifications. \nOverall I absolutley love the S20+ Altra and the buds that come with it. They have a really good sound to them and they allow you to have ambiant sound or not. The touchpad on them are amazing and you are able to change the settings to just the way you like them.\nVery happy customer here!!!!! :)",
            "I've has my phone for just under a month now and up until I started messing about with the notifications thats when  the 1 star got knocked off the 5 star review, I can't seem to sort out different notification tones for different apps ie, different tones for texts, Snapchat, Facebook and WhatsApp, its the same tone for each one, maybe seems trivial however its a niggle everything else is absolutely superb including the camera which is amazing, a small update would possibly solve the problem.",
            "Now I don't hate it so let's make that clear. I have had the S series since they started and it has always got better and better. \n\nSamsung S20 Ultra looks and feels incredible. Tech wise I have no issues it's quick and responds fine. However....\n\nBattery Life: is not the best it runs out pretty fast and I do a top up charge mid day for 30 minute's. This is with not using a lot of apps or running games. \n\nCamera: in day light is okay but this was Samsung's selling point. S10 Plus had a better camera and the 100 times zoom - I am surprised you even advertised it. Literally good for nothing at all in any light. Camera needs some serious updates and fast.\n\nThis all said I love Samsung and will stay with them.   I have full faith the right updates will come through so I will stick it out.",
            "I have had this phone 3 days and the slightest knock against it has shattered the glass back it reminds me of earlier Sony z5 until they made there screens stronger as always with Samsung Great phone and fantastic camera just get spare front and back screens ready because they will break easier than previous phones",
            "I can't speak highly enoough of the quality and performance of this phone.  Utterly unreal",
            "I have always had a Samsung phone but I have to say the camera on the S20 ultra is not as good as they say or advertise. Even with the march update the camera on my S20 ultra is still bad on focus issues especially at low light and going from normal to zoom.in daylight conditions the camera is great but no better than the galaxy S10 plus that was my previous phone.as for the 30 and 100x zoom they are just gimmicks. On Samsungs commercial you see a guy in a balloon having his picture taken at 100x zoom..believe me it looks nothing like that.the phone itself is great but I upgraded for the camera that Samsung was saying its their best camera yet.well it is not.unless Samsung don't put out another update to sort out the camera I will be selling my S20 ultra. I need a phone with a good trustworthy camera and at the moment the S20 ultra do not provide me with that. Please Samsung fix the auto focus on the camera..especially when going from normal to zoom as it is really not good and that goes for the auto focus on video too.for a phone this price it is unacceptable.",
            "I have owned every S series since S6 and once again Samsung has delivered! I traded in my s10+ and I had high expectations, and I was not disappointed!\n\nPower: Super – lots of power and everything runs so fast! 5G amazing too! \n\nDesign: Love the ergonomic and attractive design \n\nCamera: Along with the battery life, this is the best feature of the phone. Photos are razor sharp and the different modes are amazing.\n\nBattery: Another strong feature of the phone, charges really quickly and lasts much longer than other phones. (Lasted all day with lots of juice left! It can last even longer if you turn down to 60hz) \n\nSummary: Love everything about the phone, power, design, camera and battery life – I could go on! This is the phone to beat!",
            "Have had this phone for two weeks now, and while I can't deny the display is stunning, and the battery life is decent, a few things definitely don't warrant the price tag for this phone.\n\nFirstly, the touch screen. While on lock screen the phone doesn't always respond to touch to unlock it, which is very frustrating when it takes several swipes. \n\nSecondly, the camera is very disappointing. I had high expectations given the hype around it, however, the auto focus is almost non existant so to get a half decent photo you need to use manual settings.\n\nLast, the headphone jack. Taking it away now means you can't charge the phone while listening to music, which can be frustrating on the go. Not everyone wants to buy expensive Bluetooth ones. \n\nAlso, silly things like having no LED for notifications which was handy on my last S10. Overall, I regret upgrading and should have kept my S10. Has potential to be a great phone but needs certain things tweaked.",
            "Life battery rather short,probably due to not well optimised chipset(Exynos).\nI struggle to get 5 hourse Screen on time with just some basic app usage,probably if i would start playing game,watching movie and some recording wouldn't last for half a day..",
            "had the phone for a day and I'm in love with it. I've transferred from apple and I can say in such short time I'm seriously not looking back. Definitely not disappointed at all the camera is literally amazing!",
            "The Exynos s20 has terrible battery life. With no additional apps installed the battery drains quickly when using 4g. android needs to learn to be as efficient as ios with its software and battery life.",
            "I upgraded to this phone from my Galaxy S10 Plus. The 120hz display is fluid and makes 60hz devices appear laggy and slow, the battery last just over a day and charges in just over an hour, the camera is amazing, overall fantastic phone.",
            "I'm so happy with my new phone Samsung S20 ultra! The best phone ever!",
            "already loving the ease of use and gentle scrolling. Can't test the camera really as locked down in isolation! However had some fun with the zoom around the home. Can already see the front camera is superior to any I've used before. Very quick. Only thing which is a bit unhandy i find is taking a screenshot with the two buttons on one side... especially with smaller hands ✋. look forward to receiving my galaxy buds for ordering on pre-order. At least I have something to play with the next couple of weeks of being locked indoors!! Oh the best facial recognition system I've ever used. Brilliant !",
            "Wow what another amazing phone the camera super fantastic quality the 100x zoom is immense and 8k video just amazing well done again Samsung ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Bought this phone a week ago and enjoying it but I wished the night mode could be improved and better Huawei P30 Pros night mode.  Would like to see a screen shot function on the menu where the Mobile data and Bluetooth and WiFi  menu is. Also would like too see a Xenon flash for superior night time photography.",
            "I got this the s20 ultra  about 2 weeks ago \nI am very happy with it. Brilliant phone thanks",
            "I've been using S20 Ultra setting up 120Hz displaying with FHD+.\nvery much smooth than 60Hz . I can't be back to 60Hz.",
            "Great phone, recent camera firmware better but hope for further updates to max use of the large sensor.\nWould be 5 stars if SD 865 rather than the hot battery draining Exynos 990, Samsung this two tier approach needs to end!",
            "Still finding new features and with Samsung easy to follow video instructions, my camera skills alone so far have gone up in leaps and bounds. I've had a great many fantastic mobiles over the years, Apple, Huawei, Motorolla, Sony, and of course Samsung, but the Samsung S20 Ultra blows 'em all away.",
            "I have had the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G for just under 24 hours and I already love it. This phone is a power beast! And oh the screen I can honestly say it is huge but I love it (no jokes implied) the infinity-O-display really makes this phone pop I love it. I haven't really had chance to test the cameras yet but how they look at low light is incredible and that 100x Space zoom just WOW! even though the image looks like a oil painting it is still impressive that it can zoom that far. \n\nOverall, the phone I would highly recommend.",
            "My ultra arrived a few days ago. It's real good. Don't listen to the negativity of some reviewers think for yourself .",
            "It's a shame that the exynos 990 variant of this phone is almost a full generation behind the snapdragon 865 variant. A bit disappointed by this fact but still think this phone is just incredible.",
            "This phone is the best phone I have ever used in my life.",
            "Have been a Sony device user for years, but nothing currently on offer appealed, and I'm extremely happy with my new ultra purchase,still a new user with so much to learn will update in about a month.",
            "I'm on phone number 2 now with a third one the way. All faulty with a rattling sound in the enclosure as well as issues with the camera focusing and taking images in low light. Such a disappointment. Wondering why I switched from my mate 20 Pro.",
            "I got this phone mail for its camera. Yo find out there's a problem with the auto focus. It doesn't focus. I'm really disappointed. I'm thinking of returning the phone. Its brand new. I shouldn't be having a problem so soon",
            "I've only had this phone for a couple of days but already I am in love with it. The camera quality is unbelievable. The screen is so crisp and clear. Its lightweight and so easy to use.",
            "Upgraded from the S9+ which I loved & even though I've only had the S20 ultra for 2 days im so impressed by the difference between the 2 phones. The screen clarity is amazing & the camera & video quality is phenomenal.",
            "Just had the 2 phones for 3 days now. \nEasy to use.  Lots of useful features.\nLooking forward to using it fully.\nReliability and durability should be excellent going by previous Samsung phones that I have had.",
            "Pre-ordered and only 18 hours in so far but I do love it, yes. I am a Samsung nerd and have owned (S6 edge, NOTE 7 (ouch), S7 edge, S8 edge, S9 edge plus, s10 plus 5G and now this) I appreciate this phone for what it WILL be not quite what it IS just yet. It has the capabilities to be even smarter with some system updates to make the camera a little more consistent and maybe look into this 120 refresh rate demand on the battery (amongst other small things)\n\nThis will be incredible, just needs some tweaking. All the hardware is there just needs some closer attention. \n\n4.5  /  5",
            "I pre-order the galaxy S20 ultra and it is a thing of beauty! Crisp sharp screen, pictures are next level gorgeous and seamless data transfer meant that my phone was locked and loaded in less than 15 mins.\nI'm in love...!!",
            "I pre-ordered the S20 Ultra and upgraded from the S8 and this is a beast! Its much bigger and heavier than the S8 but that reflects in that you have the very best camera phone, the best screen and a very fast processor inside. \nHad a bit of a play with the camera and the wide angle lens will get plenty of use with landscapes. \nDay 2 and still loving it!",
            "I knew i needed an upgrade from my old phone after trying out a friends note 10+. Literally a few days later I watched Samsung conference about the new phones and the ultra just caught my eye so I pre ordered as soon as possible and now that I actually have it... my god it lives up to the specs and hype. I can do so much more and the experience is super high quality and buttery smooth. The camera is awesome. The phone is \"CHAUNKY\" its not exactly heavy but it has heft. The screen has so much real estate, so much space to do stuff in. I don't know what else to say apart from... Get This!",
            "So easy to transfer over to my new S20 it has amazing features and I love it\nIt out shines the other phones",
