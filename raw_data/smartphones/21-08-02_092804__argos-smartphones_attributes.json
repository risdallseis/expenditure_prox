            "This is actually about the best phone I've had. The Nokia 1020 had a superb camera, but as a clunky Windows phone wasn't otherwise great. Samsung Galaxy S7 was disappointing, as was the Pixel's predecessor, the Nokia 8, whose battery life was catastrophic. The Pixel is smaller and lighter than either of the Nokias, and feels comfortable in the hand. The camera is good, and versatile, and much better quality than the Nokia 8. Transferring apps",
            "Had the phone a few weeks now. Was simple to change from Samsung. Have had no issues and Android is so smooth compared to previous device. Photographs are excellent all in all absolutely delighted",
            "The Pixel 5 covers all of the basics and gets them absolutely spot on. No half baked extras, just solid features with frequent updates. Simply excellent.",
            "Better than any Galaxy phone  highly recommend it  camera is great plus the features will never go back to any other phone",
            "I had the Pixel 3axl for 3years after leaving Apple and didn't have any regret, but just recently changed to the pixel 5, I'm not really happy with it as I'm having some really bad issues with the calls. When I get a call, the caller Is hearing their own voice back and I'm really thinking about changing my phone again because of this, as I can't find any way of resolving the problem, unless you can Google. I've loved Google Pixel but I'm not Happy right now, please Help!!!!!",
            "Amazing and fast device. I wasn't expecting to be that great . thanks Google !",
            "Great phone with a brilliant display. Battery life is incredible, and the phone is super fast and responsive.",
            "Pixel 5 doing all required so far, although still early days.",
            "On the plus side, I like the small form factor, the waterproofing and the integration with nest.On the downside I'm seeing too many annoying bugs and glitches that force me to reset the phone. Issues I've not see with previous pixels and nexus.",
            "Smoking hot fast sexy  beautiful useful love uI always buy a pixel",
            "First of, this is my first Google phone, I love the complete lack of add on software, the pure Android is clean, fast and has everything you need. The design is great, battery brilliant. I would definitely recommend it.",
            "Absolutely fabulous display camera software engineering brilliant.",
            "I've only had new pixel 5 for couple of weeks . I'm very happy with it so far. Easy to use with a great camera .Good upgraded from my pixel 4a",
            "Good phone easy to use good camera  and a good size not to big not to small",
            "Upgraded from a pixel 4 XL so I knew what I was letting myself in for.  Battery is better, not noticed a difference in speed of the phone etc. My only gripe is the size, being used to larger phones, the 5 feels dinky.  Hope the pixel 6 will be similar in same size as the 4xl but if Google bring out a 6xl I'm all for it and will definitely be going for that when it's released.Finger print reader on the back is in the perfect spot and I've never had it not recognise, don't know if this is a good or bad thing security wise.The back of the phone feels nice and robust, comparing again to the 4xl which was glass, I was very concerned about the 4xl getting scratches or breaking even though it spent it's life in a d30 case.Overall I'm very pleased with the pixel 5 and a sound upgrade from the 4xl",
            "Had the phone for a week now and finally finding my way around it. Excellent battery life and camera. My only criticism is you can't seem to go back a page on the internet. Other than that it's a great phone with a good screen.",
            "A solid all round product. Does everything you need but doesn't really add too many standout features.Camera is good.Memory excellent.UI good.Battery life excellent.Features about standard.Charges really fast and lasts.I personally much prefer the finger unlock.The picture quality on videos and photos is also really good.This phone doesn't re invent the wheel but it does everything well. As a long time iPhone user switching has been relatively easy and so far seems to out perform my older iPhone don't know if it would compare to the top of the range handsets out at the moment but a great performing phone that I would highly recommend for cheaper but still excellent performance.Android Vs iOS is a personal preference but the playstore and quick and easy set up make this an attractive option.",
            "This phone does what is says on the box. For me it is perfect For what i need and for what little I know about phonesAs I love Google and all that comes with it.Many thanks for a good phone",
            "This is my 3rd pixel (I've previuosly had 2 and 3) and it's great to see it getting better with each iteration, I've had. The battery is superb and will easily last me 36 hours. Camera is on a different level to the 3 and even though I've not really used it anger yet can already see just how much better it is. I particularly enjoy the action shot, where you select the best shot. Love the bigger screen and the UX is joy to use. My only slight disappointment is the lack of the squeeze functionality - was the best way to snooze a morning alarm. All round, I thoroughly recommend the Pixel 5",
            "Backward step from my Google Pixel 4XL, sent the 5 back and sticking with the 4XL",
            "Only had the phone a few weeks and am very impressed. It does everything I need and is very easy to use.",
            "Love the phone, I came from a 12 pro max, also got my first chromebook Absolute beauty",
            "I upgraded from my Pixel 2XL which was a brilliant phone but unfortunately a few too many drops did it in. The Pixel 5 is very similar to the Pixel 2XL, a little smaller in build but the screen size is the same. While watching some shows on it, the camera dot shows up at the bottom of the movie as that takes up part of the screen. All in all it is a decent phone, but doesn't feel like anything more than my old one. May be I'm not using it to its full potential. If you're looking for a good decent android phone, a lower model pixel will do the same trick for a much more appealing price.",
            "Great phone unfortunately I have had to return mine as the camera freezes. I tried a factory reset, safe mode and many other recommendations but no joy. I am thinking of buying another. I have been unlucky as this is my second try as the first was lost/stolen by the carrier. Heres  hoping third time lucky.",
            "2 things I wish were better having come from a Pixel 2, but if Google keep this standard up I don't think I will ever go to a different brand.",
            "After reading other people's reviews on the pixel 5, I was reluctant to move from my pixel 2 XL. I decided to take a risk and buy it anyway, as I loved my 2XL. My main concern was the speakers, as people said it was muffled and hard to hear people talking and listening to videos/films was too quiet. I was so pleased that none of these were true. The speakers are plenty loud enough and I have to turn the volume down as it's too loud. The screen size is bigger than my 2xl but the phone is so much smaller and battery life is amazing. I now only have to charge it every other night and it's still has about 14% left. The cameras on Pixel phones are the main selling point for me and the night sight update is brilliant. I'm very happy I moved on to this phone. We'll recommended.",
            "All the features you need, without any that you don't.",
            "On paper you may say other phones are better but they just aren't! You have to use it to appreciate just how good it is. It's all about the experience! Such small things such as the feel of the phone, the weight of the phone and just how it works in general..The camera is also amazing!",
            "Despite thousands of disgruntled customers and online pleas for resolution, Bluetooth connectivity remains hugely problematic. My Pixel3 had issues for months and I naively thought Google would have resolved this in the new Pixel5. But no, I still cannot connect my phone to my car Bluetooth, hardly a rocket science challenge for the 21st century. Google still ignore the issue, still don't offer a solution, and thousands of their customers chase wildly unlikely combinations of settings to get simple connectivity resolved. I will never get another Pixel phone and I'm gutted I'm now stuck with this junk for another two years. Should have switched to a Samsung. And the functionality of the screen swipe on the Pixel5 is really not a natural or well conceived 'upgrade' on the Pixel3. Avoid this phone at all costs",
            "The camera could be a bit better but the phone it's self is good.",
            "Very happy with the new phone. Not too expensive but comes with everything I want in a phone. Excellent camera (of course) with great looking screen and a brilliant battery.",
            "Decent phone with similar capabilities of more expensive ones.I had an iPhone and would not go back.  Pleased to have made the change   Transfering the data took 3 attempts (ended up with triplicate contacts etc) but a factory reset and the next go worked perfectly.  I had to have a Gmail address that I have no immediate use for but it was worth the effort.  I'm sure transfering from another android would be simple!",
            "Camera not as good as I have been led to believe.  Quite slow. Not as good as either Samsung or iPhones that I own. Hence returned.",
            "Has a lot of clever features that I do find useful rather than just gimmicks. The fingerprint reading is very fast - other devices I have are slower and more fussy.My reason for not giving it 5* is just that it is a bit narrow. While researching it I found the body was a bit narrower than my previous phone, but the usable screen width appeared to be more or less the same. In reality the display is a full 5mm narrower. This makes it a little bit small for my liking - not a deal-breaker, but definitely a fallen star.",
            "It's a great phone all around but I really do dislike the back button or lack of back button I should say. When you are on a website that requires you to swipe to move on, it's so frustrating when it takes you back to the previous screen. BRING BACK THE BACK BUTTON!!",
            "A nice size phone, not too big, packed with easy to use features and Apps.A pleasure to use and I am very glad I made the switch from my old mobile phone.",
            "Nice to have a telephone that is manageable in size - was keen when upgrading to find a phone that was not any larger than my previous phone Samsung Galaxy A40 and the Pixel 5 was one of only 3 that I found with comparable or better features that met the size criteria and gave the best features allied to keenest price and was the only one with a metal housing.   Well done Google, when you bring out the Pixel 6 try to bring out a 5 sized variant as well.",
            "I love pixel and esp the new 5, recommend it.to anyone and the camera is top quality.",
            "I wish Google designers would look at other manufacturers regarding the batteries they choose for their handsets. I had a pixel 2 which needed charged twice a day so decided never to buy another pixel phone. Fast forward three years and I had a rethink after wanting a phone with a with a slightly smaller screen and the pixel 5 with its 6\" screen fitted the bill. Firstly the good. The camera is brilliant and updates are immediate as the android software is a Google product.The Bad. Call quality on the phone is appalling frankly. Call volume is fine but the sound is tinny and flat. The battery life isn't great either. It will go from full to 50% after a few hours of use and I'm not talking watching videos or gaming merely using WhatsApp and surfing the net. So in summary if the battery and call quality were better it would be a five star review",
            "I have loved the Google pixel since the pixel 2.... Now pixel 5 is just brilliant. Absolutely amazing, the camera is crystal clear",
            "Perfect phone, perfect size, does everything I ask it too. Had zero hassle setting it up.No stupid \"launchers\" trying to improve my experience. Just perfect and pure Android OS.I waited until I could buy the phone in Sorta Sage colour. It looks great!",
            "This is a good phone the features are good but takes a bit getting used too with everything being onscreen",
            "The fact this phone is still lacking in the calling features such as \"hold for me\" and \"call screening\" in the uk is really disappointing. I understand it's a legal issue and legal things don't move quickly but these are a unique selling point of pixel phones in the US. Google could at least keep us updated on an estimated time it will be released. As for the display it looks great, coming from a Galaxy S8 I would say the screen isn't as great as that phone but still excellent due to the refresh rate. Battery is superb, I've failed to even get close to draining it at the end of the day. Performance is excellent, much better than my S8. I also have this weird bug or something that happens with this phone and I can't replicate it reliably. Sometimes this little circle appears in the top middle of the phone and it visibly flickers in line with the refresh rate of the phone. Restarting the phone gets rid of it or sometimes it just goes away.",
            "Pixel 5 is so easy to navigate, I feel like I've had it for months. It's light and not too big, plus packed full of extra features and has an impressive battery life.",
            "Love this phone has a great camera and a clean OS with no overlays like a Samsung. It is well made and can take a knock or two without showing an signs of damage unlike most glass rubbish. The screen is great it's fast and that camera is the best in the business. Sound has aptx hd great for wireless headphones if they support it.",
            "Overall build quality is poor. I was using Pixel 2XL which seemed much better. The speaker in this one is tinny and calls don't sound as clear. The camera quality is not great compared to latest models from other brands e.g. Samsung.",
            "Good to get onto 5G, but yet to experience. Phone on Android 11, and a quick Chipset so quite a bit faster that my old phone. All seems good.",
            "Upgrade from pixel 3 and impressed so far. Couple of different controls to get used to but seems good. Nice and quick.",
            "Had the phone for a day. As soon as my mobile number switched over (after I spent 2 hours transferring all my data including images and contacts), the phone went onto the screen displaying the G with the black background, started getting extremely hot and never switched on ever again.  I lost everything I transferred. Never again.",
            "It's one of the better pixel phones to date. Mind you this is my first one to own and be bought from my own money. It's good enough for 99% of what I need to do. My biggest gripe is the use of the finger print sensor in the back. It should have been integrated with the power button for a more modern look. Aside from that, it's a pretty great phone at any price or category.",
            "Setting up the pixel 5 from my old pixel 2 was simple and time saving. Some new or different commands to learn which was slightly frustrating at first.  The battery life is good as is the camera.",
            "Had Samsung in the past and fancied a change but still Android. Not disappointed. Superb quality camera. Annoying they've changed from standard USB charger as I've recently had USB sockets fitted at home...but they're not the only manufacturer to do that. Data transfer from old phone was quick and easy. Fast charging. Good battery life.",
            "Works great as advertised, I just can't complain. Peace out.",
            "Pure android is so streamlined and a joy to use.Loving the Pixel and its long battery life. I also really appreciate the smaller form factor.",
            "Very easy to use and does everything it says it does it's light and fast",
            "Sensibly sized phone, with great performance and 2 day battery. Doesn't really need a cover, which keeps it compact. Loving it",
            "Avoid this phone as it is comparable to first generation smartphones. No functionality so I returned it for a refund.",
            "Looking to save money on your next smartphone? Forget the flagships and check out these excellent Pixel 5.Best, unlocked, and a high-end phone with stock Android",
            "Good phone. Responsive and has some nice features.",
            "Got this phone for over a week the quality it's not great sound is bad if I talk toy partner when he is out he can hear me tiny and I hardly hear him myself the camera on what's app is bad the photos when I trying to take are not as good as my previous phone not happy really",
            "As usual google make another great phone whilst people moan its not super duper flag ship that coming with pixel 6 which im really hoping to get the pixel 5 great for price with 5g etc and still best camera saved so many family moments on pixel thanks google will remain a life long user",
            "Ticks all my boxes in terms of features, software, camera etc",
            "Pretty much perfect in my opinion however it does get quite hot even with not particularly intense games to run.",
            "Just moved up from an android 8 phone. The improved spec. and software is noticeable.  Everything is smoother and just works. Battery life is excellent for a fairly light user. Sound quality is fine and the screen is bright enough except in full sunlight.",
            "An incredible build of a very good phone. Great screen and smooth operation plus great sound quality. I do video editing on my phone and the pixel 5 does the rendering quicker than all my other phones.",
            "Amazing phone with a brilliant camera. It has a smooth Google Android experience and an amazing vibrant screen that goes up to 90hz. I can really notice the difference from pixel 3a.",
            "Very happy with the phone but a bit disappointed with the sound on calls, too quiet. For someone who is a little hard of hearing, I have to take calls either by bluetooth earphones or loud speaker.",
            "Awesome screen.Perfect size.Amazing battery.Does everything you want with no gimmicks.",
            "The phone is the same size as the pixel 3. It's got little changes. The camera is better and the screen display a lot clearer. Very happy with the pixel 5. But was disappointed the phone did not come with any headphones. Other wise would have given 5 stars.",
            "Great so far. Setting up and transfer went well with much more of my preferences and history carried over from associated Bluetooth products which made it more easy to keep in routine.",
            "Very easy to use and bright screen. Overall a very good device",
            "Amazing phone! Not much else to say! better than the other brands for less money. Battery is great, Camera is awesome generally a classy lil piece of technology. Well done Google",
            "Bought to replace my pixel 4a.Nice screen, easy set up but terrible battery and super slow charging makes me regret buying this phone.Would not recommend at all.First Google phone ive been disappointed with. Not worth the upgrade at all",
            "Things I like :Smaller then Hawaii for pocket Like the homepage layout Things that are issues hence me returning it to swap for a Samsung:- Cameras awful compared to Hawaii, as - - soon as you zoom it goes fuzzy- On loud speaker it often doesn't work and people can't hear me - battery is half of Hawaii - takes minutes to turn on after battery dies , hauwaii turns on in seconds and your off - bar far the biggest issue is the fingerprint being on back. I've tried three cases and because I have nails I cannot use it ! Needs to be on front",
            "Coming from pixel 3a noticed sound quality degradation. User interface a bit buggy. Somehow the 'return' (swipe back) doesn't really work smoothly. For example,   sometimes using right left hand opens Gmail side bar instead of going back or if on WhatsApp it makes a quote instead of going back, basically I have to remember when to swipe to right and left to go back. Other things in general are good.",
            "Great simple to use phone - how android should be. Camera is excellent, no need to edit photos and mess around with settings",
            "I'm really in love with this smartphone. I strongly recommend it to anyone that likes Android but wants a more pure experience with the OS.The only downside that I see right now with it is the impossibility of removing the Google Search bar or the At Glance. Specially the search bar. I hope they give you the freedom for doing so in the near future.",
            "Traded up from my pixel 3A XL to the 5, apart from being a smaller case and a better camera I'm not that impressed really.",
            "The best screen design out of all current smartphones, with thin even symmetrical bezels all around. No silly gimmick curve edges.Really good looking screen with high refresh rate.Computing power is sufficient for a very good phone.Would be a 5 stars great phone with a more powerful chipset.However for the price, this is a really good phone.",
            "Only had the phone a few days ,but,having had the pixel 3 before this,it really is an eye opener,fast great graphics, easy to use,battery life is excellent,and no complaints about the camera,all on all very pleased,glad I upgraded.",
            "Although it has 765 Snapdragon which isn't as good as other phones, this phone is very quick and the best thing about it is that it charges quickly and holds charge very well. I have been getting around 8 hours before I charge it. The photos you can take on this phone are absolutely amazing too.",
            "Great features and browsing speed, best dimensions for a phone and good memory. Only downside is that it does not have fast charging and camera needs improvement.",
            "Love this phone. Screen is super clear, it is super quick, easy to set up and manage.   Only thing I don't like is the \"go back a page\" swipe method.  But everything else is awesome",
            "Best phone I've owned to date. Really fast, intuitive, compact, excellent camera. Quite simply, a great phone. Would recommend over anything.",
            "Still getting to know about the phone. Had Samsung phones previously. But time will tell really.",
            "Top phone, only criticism is the screen grab could be easier (like double knock the screen or swipe 3 fingers down the screen) the double tap the back does not work when using three button navigationThere is no clock on the main screen only date",
            "This is an easy to use phone that I personally don't think is to full of high end tech",
            "Phone size is spot on not to big or to small. Bring able to enlarge icons on home screen helps find them easier if you have loads on show.The camera is second to none, brilliant zoom function along with crystal clear pictures no detail missing or blurred.To be honest I can't put the Pixel 5 down.",
            "Great phone camera quality is outstanding does everything i meed it too do display also amazing when streaming or watching live",
            "The Google Pixel 5 is a great phone in my opinion. It's not got much that makes it unique from other flagship phones on the market at the moment, but the one thing that I'm really happy about is the fact that there's limited bloatware and the bloatware that is there isn't really bloatware at all.I used to get frustrated when I was using a Samsung phone, I didn't see the point in having two calenders or two app stores and so on, one being Google and the other being Samsung. In some cases you can't delete these apps from the device completely and so that's how it's known as bloatware.With the Google Pixel, the apps that are unremovable are apps that you need and they are all Google, so theres no more having two versions of the same app. Yay!Besides all that, the battery life is really good once you disable some of the power hungry functions that don't need on all the time, my only other issue was finding a decent case.",
            "A bit small not for me. In today's market it should be a larger screen.",
            "I purchased as my old phone had stopped getting updates and I could not mirror or connect direct to tv so was told this one can as it has usb-c3.1 but I got the usb-c to HDMI and it still don't work but phone is nice and better than the i-phone rubbish",
            "I am really happy with the features, especially camera!",
            "I bought this a month ago, and am happy with the product",
            "It's a brilliant phone and I'm very pleased with it. It does everything you'd expect it to do, it's reliable and easy to use. My previous phone was a 3a and that was flawless too, even the battery was still good after 2 years heavy use. Pixel 6 camera picture quality is superb. Slightly smaller phone than the 3a but screen size is larger. Overall love the pixel and would recommend to everyone.",
            "This is a great phone I always buy Google phones. okay so the battery life can be an issue and never quite lasts as advertised, but I think it's the same with all manufacturers.",
            "I really love my new Pixel 5, I have moved from Samsung and therefore abandoned all the customisation that comes with it. This is a simple to use, highly complex device that puts all that you need quickly in easily accessible places.However, even with the cloth effect case it is a slippy little thing and I have already managed to acquire a broken camera lens cover. How I don't know , dropped a few times but not onto anything hard or from any great height. Currently exploring repair options, plus a better case.",
            "Large screen, but compact. 90hz refresh rate is a joy to use. Uncluttered pure Android is much better. All at an affordable price. Excellent phone.",
            "Good phone for the price it is although it's a shame they removed the face id. There could be more features on the phone but overall a brilliant phone working smoothly and opening apps efficiently.",
            "I had a Google pixel 2 for around four years and was very excited for my upgrade to the pixel 5. Unfortunately, it's very underwhelming. The phone is very small, display very similar, camera not much improved and the user interface is perhaps even a little worse. I am hopeful it will grow on me.",
            "The gestures and swipes lead to erratic window closures unless absolutely precise - needs dedicated back button",
            "Great phone, it's fast, great all day battery and works like a phone. Just wish the screen was a bit bigger, having used the old pixel 1 phone.",
            "Overall it's a good phone with great software experience. The camera is brilliant but again this is mainly due to software the hardware is starting to feel abit dated. The screen is great would of like an XL model personally. The processor is ok and even if weren't aiming for top 'flagship' specs a slightly better one would of been nice for the price.",
            "Wanted Android good specs but not expensive and I love it",
            "Great product with really fast speeds and looks fantastic",
            "Great phone.Don't hesitate.If I could suggest 2 things it'd be , give user choice to remove permanent Google search bar and I wish they'd made an XL .Bar that everything's perfect.",
            "I'm not good with technology but I'm finding this phone easy to use although I'm still trying to find my way around it and getting used to it  I think its a good phone and I would recommend it",
            "Upgrading from the pixel 2 to pixel 5 I already had extremely high expectations but the 5 has managed to surprise me, what an amazing device!",
            "Like the phone and the size, getting used to it now. Not quite as easy as my previous phone because the finger print reader will not work with phone in case which is really annoying. All other areas it's great.",
            "Best phone out there. Cheaper than Apple and better than Samsung",
            "Overall amazing phone , comfortable in the hand, the texture is amazing, display is 10/10, camera front and back are both amazing and speedy phone. 10/10 phone!",
            "Pixel 5 is nice phone but heavily over priced its main failing is there are no buttons and mine will not follow your finger I have to keep dragging across many times to go back, mi old Moto g5 had a back button and was very accurate and sensitive.",
            "Everything about this phone is just great, not the most enhanced specs but Google's software makes it on par with other flagship devices. Camera is obviously amazing as always, and the 90hz display makes it a snappy experience. It's a solid solid phone, with no major flaws.",
            "I've gone to pixel 5 from pixel 3 and it is very similar experience, exactly what I wanted and expected. Phone just works, as did the pixel 3. However I am sat here with 50% battery, having not given phone a boost all day, where as pixel 3 would have needed to be on charge by now.I've only been using pixel 5 for a week, but the one issue I had with pixel 3 has gone (battery) and I haven't experienced any issues at all. Just works.",
            "As a proud previous owner of Pixel 3A XL switching to Pixel 5 marked all tick boxes what I needed from mobile phone.",
            "I've recently upgraded from a Pixel 3 the best phone every made by Google or any company in my opinion. The Pixel 3 and 5 very are similar which means the Pixel 5 is a good phone, yet despite being 2 generations newer is overall slightly worse than the pixel 3. Positives for Pixel 5 over Pixel 3-bigger screen, better battery life, more storage. These are quite mediocre improvements really.Negatives-the screen colouring is bad. Mainly it is the white which has a greyish/greenish tint and compared to the brilliant whites of the Pixel 3 it really stands out. I have noticed however when the phones are in direct sunlight the whites are good on both phones! In a blind camera test between Pixel 3 and 5 I preferred 5 of the Pixel 3 pictures out of 6 shots. The pictures to be fair are both similar and good for phone cameras but the Pixel 5 is 2 generations newer yet doesn't appear any better.Speakers are considerably better on the Pixel 3.I'd recommend buying the Pixel 3 instead.",
            "This is my third Pixel - I've previously used the original Pixel, then a Pixel 3XL which was recently running out of steam and space. Easy to transfer all the apps and data - in fact, it took so little time, I wondered if it had been too easy. The screen is superb and a big improvement on the Pixel 3XL - very noticeable when taking photos or watching videos. The Pixel 5 is much smaller than the Pixel 3XL, but it isn't burdened by that unsightly notch, so the actual screen size seems fairly comparable. No complaints at all so far - very easy to use, much more space for apps and downloads. Five stars from me.",
            "Really glad I made the jump to pixel 5 from S8. It might not feel as fancy with a glass back and that but.. The P5 is sturdy (check Jerry Rig Everything on youtube) solid phone. Having the latest Google Android software makes a difference rather than the 3rd party overlays. Its fast, camera is excellent. I like the resin back and sides of phone, its going to be much harder to break. I actually moved to this phone as the past few all glass phones I've had ended up at the insurers for repairs so many times.",
            "What can I say it's one of the best phone out there",
            "Think this phone is massively underated, far better than the iPhone 11pro I had previously. Would recommend this phone to anyone.",
            "I love this phone. Does everything I need, it's secure and sturdy. The camera is amazing! My only issue is that it's a little big for my tiny hands, despite being one of the smallest on the market. To be fair, the way you navigate around the screen does do something to negate this, but it's easy to drop when you can't get your hand all the way around it. I do have seriously tiny hands though ( I've met 8 yr olds with bigger hands than mine) so for normal people this shouldn't be an issue.",
            "I came to the Pixel 5 after a brief and disappointing episode with an iPhone. The Pixel is the best phone I've owned. It's compact, which I love. It's fast. The uncluttered Android experience is fantastic and the 90 Hertz refresh rate makes everything feel very quick and fluid. And that camera is just brilliant.",
            "Been with Apple for almost 10 years but I won't back for real, the Camera the Pixel5 5G it's absolutely breathtaking, it has have 4k 30 frm and 4k 60 frm the microphone is amazing and the best of it the prices more than half of the iPhone, very happy",
            "Previously had the Pixel 2 XL, much prefer this phone though. Fits better in the hand, much lighter but feels sturdy.",
            "I had the pixel 3 and was due for my upgrade. Of course I went for the google pixel 5. Will always use google from now on.",
            "I couldn't be bothered to wait for the 6 as I was gagging to upgrade from my Pixel 3 so I settled on getting the 5. I like it so far, the camera quality has definitely improved since the 3 BUT OMG when I opened the box to find no headphones, I was shocked and very nearly tempted to send the phone back in exchange for an iPhone (which I secretly despise!) Google are way too early in the game to be stingy and not include headphones along with the phone considering how much the handset is worth.. anywhoo, I am still trying to get my head around navigating the new functions on the 5 but hopefully I should have it down in a couple of weeks. Battery life seems really strong so far too so overall I would give a 7/10.",
            "No different to my last phone pixel 3 camera a bit better",
            "Had the phone 2 weeks and I love it, great camera, great anti spam filter on phonecalls, clear sound when playing music. Waterproof. Every time I think it can't get better, it does.",
            "Coming off the back of having a Huawei, this is a pretty great phone. My only real problem with it so far is the 'back' smart gesture as I keep accidentally going back when I'm trying to scroll",
            "Great performance. Very simple and elegant. Powerful and does everything I need. DIdn't come with 3rd part manufacturers products and apps pre-installed which is a massive bonus.",
            "I found using the device a pleasure to use due to the stock Android experience which I heavily prefer, although there seems to be no system wide equaliser support or native HDMI desktop mode like Samsung DEX.The better Snapdragon Processor makes even a mid tier SKU a pleasure to use especially due to Google's tight software integration making battery life pretty amazing, however I'd rather have had a top of the line Processor like the 888.Lack of headphone jack is definitely a drawback, it's not something I want to get used to, bring it back, dongles are a pain and easy to lose. Have a good integrated dual DAC and I'm happy.Despite the mid tier SOC it is snappy and smooth to use and a pleasure to use.Pleas make full external backups a reality so that I can restore my phone to exactly how it was when backed up like iOS devices.Great phone, good reliability, regular updates and is now my main phone instead of my exynos s21 ultra. Still s21 ultra is my go to media and gaming dev",
            "I love the phone however I think there should a bigger version. I was disappointed to know there wasn't going to be the usual XL version",
            "Just a smaller version of the older model with pointless add ons ...nobody needs to charge there phone with the back of my phone it's a nice idea but just not needed other than that it's a bit brighter ....Im going back to the 4xl.....also don't be idiots bring back the xl versions",
            "In the short time of owning my Pixel 5 l have found that it has worked very well but l have found that at times the screen has been fairly unresponsive requiring several firm taps to perform the required function although most of the time it is ultra sensitive",
            "I'm a big pixel fan having had the 2XL before this one. The pixel 5 is the perfect size, with a combination of great software. I have had this phone for a couple of weeks and am super impressed so far.",
            "Bought this as an upgrade for my Pixel 3. Everything about the phone has been excellent so far. Camera, battery life, display, speed. And the price is much more favourable than some of the other top Android phones.",
            "Lives up to the hype and is a fantastic phone! Android at its best!",
            "This phone is the best phone I have ever had its runs fast great display all features work perfectly holds decent charge",
            "Battery not as good as I thought. Not as user friendly as my p30",
            "I had watched all the videos and read all the reviews that led me to decide on Pixel 5 over others.However, nothing had prepared me for the amazingly intuitive, comfortable and pleasurable experience that I have had with this phone. Even iPhone users are blown away by the quality of the screen and the smoothness of the movements.And I just love the simple gestures that move me from screen too screen and action to action. A gem at half the price of of other flagship phones.",
            "The most annoying thing is incessant pop up reminders for system updates, despite already having installed them.Ever since I turned the phone on I have had constant \"system update, restart your phone now\" and even if you do what they say, you can't stop them appearing.Analogue headphones don't work, so you can't plug normal headphones in using a USB-C adapter which is frankly ridiculous.The screen picks up marks incredibly easily. It's just been in my pocket and already has little marks and nibbles round the edge.Overall I have to say I regret buying it, but there is not much decent competition at the moment since I can't stand Samsung phones.I have had every nexus and pixel phone and I'm getting progressively less impressed which is a great shame.",
            "Great software, regular updates, quality materials used to manufacture the handset.Size is about right as it is in between being too small and too large.",
            "Superb battery, great camera, smooth display. Just the right size, and light.",
            "My 3xl was better , it's going back , screen is to small, won't open some apps by voice , waste off money",
            "Brilliant quality camera, intuitive and links with all my Google tech.",
            "As a mid-range phone I think the Pixel 5 is fine.  It's not aiming to be the best at anything and you get the stock Android without any fluff on top.  The display is good and the camera is solid.  I went with one of the Google cases and it's nicely put together.",
            "Not as good as my 3a which I had before this, it feels more clunky maybe, I got used to the 3a size and now this feels small. Not as happy with it as I thought I would be when getting a new phone. But the phone is good.",
            "Really happy with my phone. I've been a pixel phone user for years, had both the original and Pixel 3 but this one is easily the best.  Biggest plus, the battery is absolutely fantastic. Battery life has always been a weak point in past Pixel phones I've used, but the Pixel 5 fixes that and then some!  I'm getting two days easily and that's with doing everything I would normally do, checking it throughout the day, browsing the internet, making calls, various messaging apps and streaming music.Everything else is what I've come to know and love about Pixel, brilliant software, stellar camera and a lovely big screen, but still kept in a manageable overall footprint that I can actually hold and use in one hand.  Very happy customer and this phone just confirms that I'll be sticking with Pixel for many years to come.",
            "I guess it is exactly what it says on the tin. I feel comfortable buying such a product from Argos as opposed to a random unverified company.",
            "Wonderful phone, upgraded from the Google Pixel 3a. Super fast, great customization features, no issues as of yet. Speakers slightly worse than the Google Pixel 3a, but not a great problem I watch youtube videos with and without my earbuds and it's fine.",
            "Needs a bigger screen.Cheap build quality.Competition is offering way betrer spec at this price",
            "I decided to buy this phone as the two previous models had been recommended to me by friends and family. I'm enjoying this phone very much. The only downside is that the camera and video do not offer a 1:1 ratio for Instagram videos.",
            "Always have had iOS, wow I have been missing a lot, phone is small fast and the camera is great. Clear and smooth screen loving the pixel right now.",
            "There's a lot I like about this phone. Good point - Awesome battery, awesome camera, awesome speakers when your on speaker phone. Bad point - warms up a little (expected), can be glitchy on calls might be the network or internet connectivity but can't rule out the phone, screen size could have been a little bit bigger (but that's just me)Overall - good value for money what's next Google?",
            "Smooth, powerful, amazing camera and great battery life. Great value for money. Use it alongside an iPhone 11. I prefer my Pixel.",
            "No face id  no front finger print waste of money. In rest works like normap phone",
            "I am very pleased with it and it lives up to all my expectations.I thoroughly recommend the Pixel 5.",
            "This is an amazing phone. Don't be fooled in to thinking you need the best spec hardware or an all glass fingerprint magnet.The camera is fantastic, the software is smooth, the screen is bright and pin sharp, and the battery lasts for up to 2 days, depending on usage.The size is right and you won't be struggling to reach all corners of the screen like other flagships.",
            "Phone feels great in the hand. Lovely and solid construction, satin finish which is nice and grippy. Software is excellent. I wouldn't buy any other Android phone - pure Android direct from Google cannot be beaten. Very slick interface, has not stuttered once. Fingerprint sensors work first time every time.Cameras are excellent. Screen is excellent (and not ridiculously big as seems to be the way now). All in, the best phone I have ever had and a big improvement on Pixel 3a (which I also liked).",
            "Luv it. Upgraded from pixal 3A. No issues. Straight transfer over of data. Luv all my Google devices. Easy to use or should I say user friendly.  Lots of helpful tips from Google, which is bril as I'm not technically minded . Lovely easy to use camera. Stunning colourful photos.",
            "Bought this phone as a replacement for the Pixel 3. It's got a better battery life, wireless charging, and some great features that are new or from previous Pixel phones. The Pixel 5 feels like a great phone.My big complaint however, is the camera. The Google Pixel 5 feels like it has a camera worse than the Pixel 3. I went out and took some pictures, and all of them looked too blurry and low-res. Wide angle is nice, but the zoom function is useless because anything above x1 magnification turns your 2021 smartphone camera into a 2004 flipphone camera. The stabilisation feature looks like a much needed improvement, and the Pixel 5 retains many great features from previous versions like night vision, time lapse, slow mo, panorama and lens. However, none of it matters when the camera quality doesn't live up to previous phones, or the phones of it's competitors. I feel some buyer's remorse after buying the Pixel 5, and I'm seriously considering returning it.",
            "I am so so impressed by the ease and quality of the Google Pixel 5. Having only previously used Apple smartphones and slowly becoming disenfranchised, I realised I needed to try something different and I'm glad I did. The camera on the Pixel 5 is better than any I've had before, the OS is easy to use and logical and I like having more options to decide how my phone works. The fast charge is incredible and I like the prediction for battery length. All in all, worth every penny I paid for it and would recommend to anyone.",
            "I will happily destroy this phone with a hammer, all it does it beeps with emails from Google and it is crippled with Google apps. No Google and will be a great phone.",
            "This is an excellent phone. It has significantly better battery life than my previous phone and all of the photos I have taken of my newborn baby and of my toddler in motion have come out extremely well. I was amazed by the capabilities in low light. I haven't even managed to scratch the surface of its capabilities yet but I am very happy with it so far.",
            "Not had it long but finding it really easy to use. I'd recommend it. So fast.",
            "If you want a good, fast phone, at medium price. Then this is it. I got tired of paying silly money for \"upgrade\" phones, and there is nothing different. This phone has briiliant battery time. Two days full use now, and still on 55%. Not that i stare at my screen, but compare to other phones, with normal use, txt, phone, FB, twitter, google odd thing, it outlasts them by at least a day. Its 5G, so your ready. Plus the latest Andriod system and lots of unique features that come with it. Early days, but cant fault it.",
            "Battery drain much quicker than my old smartphone with smaller battery. Internet connection sometimes disconnected with no reason. And Bluetooth losing signal with my headphones.",
            "Excellent phone perfect seamless Google integration.",
            "Always been a fan of pixels however when I saw reviews, the pixel 5 didn't fare very well afaint other phones but I think this is the most underated of then all. Live it!",
            "Early days still, but so far impressed, once you get used to the UI, it becomes a pleasure to use, not having a glass back is actually a boon grip wise, face recognition is a feature I'm missing, bit as the finger print sensor seems reliable it's not to bad.",
            "The pixel 5 is the best phone I've ever owed by far.",
            "I do love this phone. Suggested improvements: notification light on screen? motion photos?Overall I am very happy with the phone; I like size and that it's lightweight and love that it's a Google product.",
            "Started off with a P6 then a 2xl that I liked so much I kept for just over 3 years. Now I have the 5 and I am not disappointed. The phone is smaller than the XL but the screen is larger. The camera is as good as ever. It's runs so smooth. I have had a couple of other brands but will never go back. Can't beat the pure Android with no bloat wear. Highly recommended",
            "Not sure about the speaker inside the phone ..................",
            "Moved from Apple to the pixel 3a, and then upgraded to the pixel 5 a few weeks a go and honestly it's just so good. Super easy to use and makes ever day life just that little bit simpler. Can't see myself wanting to use a different make of phone for the foreseeable future. Cheap enough that I can buy a new one of it breaks, sturdy enough to trust that it wouldn't break easily. Hands down, Google wins the phone race for me.",
            "This is a great phone, very clever and intuitive. The size is perfect and the memory and battery are brilliant. I had Zoom call and on the Pixel 4, even on charge the battery would stay the same, but on this phone whilst on charge it charged up even whilst on the call. Afterwards while still on Zoom without charging, it lost just 5 percent. Amazing.",
            "It's ok at the moment still getting used to it time will tell",
            "Good phone, fast and easy to use not massive in the hand. It also receives updates quickly so that's always a plus.",
            "Moved from a Samsung S20  and its been a huge improvment.",
            "will only charge with a special usb c cable so i can't borrow my friends chargers. only takes google brand usb c adapter. camera has less features than most phones but is still good. fingerprint sensor barely works and i miss face id. phone is fast and i like the software",
            "It was a great phone, good camera, a bit upset about the size of the phone, other than that, would recommend",
            "I have had this phone for only a week. I up graded from a hwawi pro 20. so far so good. The camera takes nice photos The only down fall is that it doesn't have no option to use head phones.. I ended up buying blue tooth head phones.. it's a nice size.. Im still getting use it.overall a decent phone",
            "Only had for a week so far, all good so far, originally had the pixel 3xl and was debating for a while whether to swap to the 5 and I am so pleased I did.",
            "Awesome compact phone. If you're fed up of carrying a monster in your pocket, this is your phone. Great phone overall. Fantastic camera and battery so far.",
            "Easy to use and would recommend it to anyone",
            "Was very excited to get this upgrade from the Pixel 3 but the sound quality is so poor in comparison, both using speaker phone and playing music / podcasts. Thumbs down Google.",
            "Love the phone so far barring not having a fingerprint sensor on the side - the one on the back is great but useless in the car cradle.",
            "While the device is quite small, it feels quite nice. I never really liked glass backs as they're easy to break, and this phone is perfect for me.",
            "I'm very happy with this phone, always liked a pixel phone.",
            "Bought due to wanted a small phone for my small hands. Powerful enough to play Roblox which my children have hooked me on during the many lockdowns. Great camera. Switching phones was very simple. Took a few days to adjust but I love it!",
            "Fantastic phone. Best camera on market . Not as powerful on paper as other phones but because of the way the software runs it's quicker than its rivals. It's great to not have Samsung apps slowing down the system. It's light and just the right size to handle and use. The battery wow the battery , I am a heavy user and get an easy day and a half out of the battery where my Samsung wouldn't see out a working day without a charge. If you are an apple fan buy an iPhone , but if you like Google this is far better than any other brand. Buy the pixel 5",
            "Only had it a couple of weeks now. Amazing battery and camera!",
            "Everything so far is excellent and battery life is amazing.",
            "You can clearly see that Google has gone through every detail on this phone to make sure everything works perfectly - not a single thing I would change.",
            "This is my 4th Pixel phone with the 5 replacing the 3.  My main bug bears would be lack of a XL model, although the screen size is bigger than the 3 due to no margins at the top and bottom, and stereo speakers. You can hear the difference in quality of sound with the one bottom speaker.Disappointing that no ear phones are included as current flagship.On the upside, it has a bigger screen than the 3, it is faster, and 5G which I didn't realise was part of my contract is impressive.Very easy set up.Bring back Google Music which was so much nicer to use than YouTube music and it would be great.Camera is very good, nice sharp photos, which look good even when zoomed in.",
            "I think it is a very good quality phone at a reasonable price. The photos it makes are amazing and the phone overall it is very responsive, the battery lasts very long and overall great to use. I'm very happy with this purchase.",
            "I am very happy with the new phone, it's Camera is as amazing as my old Pixel 3 and that is an important element for me as I take a lot of pictures, in addition it is much lighter in weight, and so much faster when playing my games or looking at video or on line. It's sharper all round and I am very pleased with it. I'm that impressed I'm getting one for my mother as she's a big gamer and is always on line so the speeds will impress her. 5 stars from me.",
            "Awesome phone. Had my Pixel 1 og until just purchased this one since finally dropped it like it's hot on cement from the second story. Only thing that sux is the lack of phone jack. Screen is awesome. Sound is ok for everything but phone calls due to speaker placement. Overall very happy. Solid, responsive, and very good value for money.",
            "Good phone, fun and easy to use, the last Google phone I had was the G1 which I thoroughly enjoye, I'm glad I've come back",
            "Had the phone for a couple of weeks now.  I'm very happy with it.  All pluses and not minuses so far.  It's very quick with a great OS.",
            "I had the pixel 3xl and loved it. Then went to Samsung S21 and had nothing but problems with it. I then switched to pixel 5 and it's faultless perfect phone",
            "Upgraded from a Pixel 2. Beautiful screen (getting used to the hole punch, the fun wallpapers help). Smooth as a baby giraffe, fast as an Irish greyhound, the user interface is a pleasure, brilliant camera and oh...it makes phone calls!",
            "The phone is seriously hot during face time calls and usage. To the point I have to but it down or stop using it. And thats in the winter cold times it's going to be worse in the summer. I have experienced this before. The phone came in a jiffy bag after a terrible mix up from o2 and I believe I have been giving a reconditioned phone due to the lack off packaging it came in. Singe jiffy bag no charger, no box, no sim like I asked. Very disappointed.",
            "I love having Pixel phones. So far it's my second one, but it is just as good as the one before. I like how easy it is to use and how it adapts to my needs. Very smart smartphone))",
            "Great phone! Love the camera/video and the size of it is perfect (previous one was Google pixel 3 XL which was also amazing).Only let down for me so far was that I Paid full price for the phone only a couple of days before they dropped the price ( unlucky I guess)",
            "This is a great phone!! The shots and videos you can take are wonderful.",
            "Last phone Pixel 3 was good, but battery on the 5 lasts twice as long easy",
            "It's a phone so personal preference rules\n\nI chose this phone because I prefer the stock android experience. This replaces my 2-3 year old pixel 3 which I broke the charge port on and the overall experience is much the same save for incrementally improved performance. \n\nThe screen is great for its fast refresh rate and the usual OLED benefits (no backlight ruining dark images)",
            "Amazing battery life, easy intuitive controller and with Google assistant being on another level. This is a fantastic phone and you should definitely buy it.",
            "I love my new pixel 5.i thought about buying a pixel for the last couple of years but the battery life was always poor. This version is really good and battery lasts about 2 days with Bluetooth on, watching YouTube, emails internet surfing so, not heavy use but still get 2 days use on a charge. Camera is fantastic and both video and photo use is superb. Phone is very quick and snappy to use.",
            "Great phone... Takes over perfectly from my Pixel 3..   Cheers",
            "I am a loyal Pixel user and they have once again, shown me why they deserve to be the phone of choice. The battery is great and just keeps going, the camera is awesome and I love the new features you get with each new Pixel. Plenty of storage, always the first for updates. Nothing else is needed!",
            "An amazing all rounder with so many smart features and really fast with a top class camera really can't fault it when it comes to the design and features of the overall phone itself.Good job Google !",
            "Excellent compact phone, which is easy to use, and contains all the features I required.",
            "Swoped from iPhone to Pixel 5 a great replacement love using it",
            "Great little phone running stock' android. No heavily modified interface like other branded android phones. Fast, smoth scrolling with 5g built in. Cheaper than some top end snartphones but no way inferior. Phone is as fast as these competitors  Great camera produces crisp, clear colourful pictures.  This is a great little phone, no need to pay over the odds when this does everything anyone would want.",
            "Excellent size and software and hardware are a dream to use I previously had a pixel 3, I’m so pleased with the phone 5 stars",
            "Great phone, intuitive, easy and fast.Love how it uses guestures to navigate around the phone.",
            "For a phone that doesn't break the bank it does everything very well. It's not going to break any records or do anything especially cutting edge but, honestly, who cares? The camera is great, again it's not cutting edge but, for every day use it's great.",
            "At upgrade time was looking for something that was straight forward to use and responsive. Very pleased so far.",
            "The phone itself is great. You're getting the best of Google software and an incredible battery life. The most I've been able to get is 9.5 hours screen on time with video watching, games, and location. I love the size, personally it's perfect for me and it has a good build. The cameras however are definitely the weakest part. The wide angle, for me, is an almost worthless addition that doesn't add a great deal to the device. Pixel devices have always been the top of the pile when it comes to cameras, but this wide angle lens doesn't feel like a pixel camera. It's fixed focus so has an inherent softness to it, it's not as wide as other wide angle lenses and it isn't able to make use of astrophotography mode which is where I would use it the most. The tele lens on the Pixel 4 was much more useful. The main camera is as great as it always has been, but it's showing its age now. Google need a better and bigger sensor, and better lenses if they are to stay as the best of mobile photography",
            "I have a Google pixel 2XL. I bought the 5 as I thought the camera would be loads better. When it arrived I took loads of pics with both phones sides by side, in different lights etc. The difference was hardly noticeable so I sent the 5 back. Great if you don't already have a pixel but not much of an upgrade from the 2XL I already had, which I've stuck with.",
            "The camera is ok, but the front facing camera can sometimes get in the way of certain types of apps.Otherwise it's fast and smooth. Compact and sounds great. The picture quality is excellent and it seems to handle multiple tasks well. I've had a good gaming experience with it so far and am pleased overall. The device battery has a good life and charges quick.",
            "Moved over from Huawei as since the last update its got a bit worrying with all the updates and the suggested apps from their store. With the support for P20 Pro ended made the switch to Pixel and loving it, its a great little phone.",
            "It is taking me time to get it set up 110% but it is doing everything I want it to.If anything the screen is too sensitive but as yet I haven't got a case etc.",
            "It's early days and I still haven't learned the subtleties yet, however it's an easy to use slick phone which I much prefer to the Huawei P20 Pro I had previously.The operating system is very impressive and the phone looks good too.Well pleased so far.",
            "Decided to get the pixel 5 after using iPhone for past 10 years and I don't regret it, far better than apple",
            "Smooth, fast, latest. Camera is the best thing. 8 GB ram is super fast. Less hassle. More productive.",
            "I was a bit sceptical at first to buy this phone however, i was really impressed with the phone. The phone camera quality is really good. The phone is easy to use and navigate and i most impressed by the Google Assistant. But the phone screen is a bit small",
            "Great phone, does everything I need effortlessly and integrates seamlessly with my existing Google kit.",
            "It's one of my biggest disappointments this year. Great software, average hardware with awful sound quality when calling which is what I use the most on a phone. If you use the phone for media mainly then it's fine.",
            "I've had this phone for about 2 weeks. I might be a little biased as I consider myself a Pixel fan. My previous phone was Pixel 2 which I liked a lot. Battery life was the only thing I did not like. I am very pleased that this is finally fixed with Pixel 5. Another thing I particularly enjoy is the way the phone feels in hand as it is now less slippery as compared to my old Pixel. The round corners and the fact that the screen uses almost the entire front area of the phone is another great feature. I was worried about speed knowing that Google chose a relatively cheap CPU for the phone to be able to offer this great price. However, my experience is that the phone is very responsive for all my use cases, except taking pictures where it noticably takes some time to process the picture before it can be shared which I think is tolerable. Overall, I am very happy.",
            "Amazing, seamless integration of everything I need in life and work",
            "This is a superb phone. It's android but without the rubbish Samsung touches. Pure Google and works really well. Still finding my way around it but it is so easy.",
            "Overall it's a good phone but has no Wow factor. Screen small , light weight. Camera OK but same camera they have had for years.Nothing says buy me compared to older models. For a low spec the model is to other phones still runs reliably",
            "Love Pixel 5. Love Android in it's most vanilla form.",
            "What a great phone. Upgrade from Pixel 2. That was a great phone but wow Pixel 5 so much faster and better.. Sound is amazing. Yes no front facing stereo but once your over that.. well the bass is deep.. phone size nearly the same as Pixel 2 but bigger screen size. Camera is amazing.. Battery last all day plus into the next. If your not a bevy user you should easily get 2 full days.. I don't charge mine as much now. I can even use the sat nav all day and still have 50% battery left...Can't wait for Android 12 update.",
            "I used to have a Pixel 2, but I accidentally dropped it and something heavy fall on it. I was happy with my Pixel 2 even after 3 years using it, so I thought I would go for Pixel 5 this time.It is a brilliant phone with superb camera and software. I would not buy any other brand.",
            "Upgraded from a pixel 2 and for the most part I am very happy. Pleased they brought back the finger print scanner but miss the option to squeeze the phone to activate Google assistant. Unfortunately sliding from a corner is much more fiddly.",
            "So the phone is great. Perfect size for one hand, good screen. It's quick enough for most things. Battery seems excellent and lasts a long time generally.Camera is absolutely superb for both pictures and video. So if this is something high on your list I would definitely recommend this. Negatives for me: you can't expand the storage and it doesn't come with headphone or even a headphone jack. So now I have to invest more money to replace something I already have but can't use here. It's not good enough really. For the price you'd expect to be able to listen to Spotify straight from the box. Overall excellent value. However these things let it and Google down",
            "Great phone nice size, night camera is brilliant, photos are top draw,",
            "After years of chasing high specs and dealing with chunky slab phones with glitchy software, the Pixel 5 comes as a breath of fresh air. It is, as the Swedish say, lagom, or just right. Not the fastest, but fast enough. Big enough to be useful but small enough to feel good in the hand. Sharp cameras that take great pictures, not merely bullet points on a spec sheet. Software that gets out of the way and just works, with thoughtful Pixel features such as Focus Mode and Flip to Shhh! It even looks gentle and unassuming in Sorta Sage, with a strokably soft finish.It's not perfect, of course (what is?) The earpiece speaker is under the glass, which helps with the lovely uniform bezels and gives surprisingly clear sound, but also limits the volume and makes the phone vibrate a little in the hand.When that's it for the cons, though, you know you're onto a winner. The Pixel 5 simply smooths and brightens my day, and I'll never look at other phones in the same way again. Thanks, Google!",
            "This phone was recommended to me by a relative. \nI'm really pleased with the phone. Battery lasts for ages. Camera is fabulous!\nThe switch from my old iPhone was so easy the Google pixel has a lead with it connect it to old phone and everything transfers real quick!\nI'm using the same PAYG sim I had in my old phone in this new one.",
            "I have upgraded from the pixel 3 and love it, only criticism is should have an XL version",
            "Love this phone has some great features on it as well",
            "Argos always has good service and collected next day",
            "I was expecting a upgraded camera from what I had on my pixel 3 XL, but it is not the case.Hence, it lost one of the front cameras (the one with the wide angular), which I always thought to be one the key features of my old phone. So, overall I'm a bit disappointed with the cameras on my Pixel 5.",
            "Really like this phone, it's really fast and has great software, best I've seen",
            "I upgraded to the Pixel 5 from the Pixel 3 that had served me well but was beginning to lose pace with the rapid mobile developments.From a hardware perspective I appreciate the default 128GB in comparison to the 64GB I had before this was significant in terms of not having to clear data/cache and apps when storage often ran low on my Pixel 3. The integrated front camera in the display is a nice touch and reduces the interference with viewing the screen compared to a notch or a smaller screen, which on the Pixel 5 reaches into the corners of the display as well as the higher refresh rate make watching videos and using the user interface feel a lot faster.More importantly for me the integration of various accessories are outstanding, with Pixel buds 2 and Google Home devices operating seamlessly with much better integration and a very useful Google assistant to read text on screen or share info as part of a 'daily routine' - all very useful and make the Pixel 5 indispensable.",
            "Just what you'd expect from a Google Pixel. So far no problems, just a shame they don't allow expandable storage.",
            "I can't text one contact because 3 photos have been stuck sending for more than 24 hours and it doesn't respond to the x to stop them.  Texts are queued behind the photos. Rebooting doesn't help either. The fail timeout needs to be about 100x shorter.",
            "Phone is great. It's easy to learn how to use all the features and has so many quality of life improvements that make using the device a pleasure. Highly recommended to anyone that wants a phone that just works.",
            "I love Google phones, I had the pixel 4 which is still my favourite phone, they have so many great features that I use every day. How ever I'm finding things which also I do not like on this model. When playing games that require swiping or have control sticks I find the screen gesture from swiping the edge of the screen get in the way and try close the game. Also I'm having issues with phone calls where I can not hear anyone, this has happened on multiple calls, they have to call again which then seems to fix the issue. Final issue so far is the speaker being at the bottom of the phone, I find when watching things in portrait mode my little finger blocks the speaker and distorts the sound, as much as I try it's uncomfortable to hold the phone with out my finger supporting it from underneath.",
            "Nice to hold, the fingerprint recognition works well. The camera is absolutely fantastic. I love that the phone is not full of bloatware, just stuff that is actually useful.Best of all.. it's waterproof.. As my last phone met an untimely end round the u bend, this is a huge plus.The battery life is great so far and I think you get a lot of phone for your money.",
            "Fast , excellent and not complicated, good battery life .",
            "Couldn't ask for more in a phone. Super quick, light - gone from a Pixel 3XL and not noticed size difference. Great price - and could write 500 words on how amazing the camera is!!! What's not to love!!!",
            "pixel 5 is a great phone, crossing from a Samsung has been no hassle. Love the little touches that link with my Google account. One thing I have noticed and I'm struggling to adapt to is the call quality. The placement of the speakers seem to have an effect where the caller sounds like there in a tunnel. This is pretty irritating and really is quite difficult to adjust too.",
            "Battery life much better than Pixel 3 and the wide angle camera is great. The only downside is retrieving the open apps screen which is so so unintuitive - very unusual for Google/android - small thing but very annoying at the same time! This prevents me giving it a full 5/5!",
            "I have tried in excess of 8 different devices since selling my pixel 4xl back in January including Samsung S20   S20ultra s21 ultra one plus 8pro and both the iPhone 12 and 12 pro finally managed to get hold of a pixel 5 and this phone is by far the best phone I've had again Google have made an incredible camera phone that's fast as you need it great at point and click photographs giving you stellar images every time, this is my 5th pixel device as I've had everyone from the 1st gen pixel to the 5 now and I think Ive finally made the decision that when I do upgrade in the future it will always be to another pixel device.",
            "Overall it's a lovely phone however with technology I always rate a product on how long it can survive and stay fairly up to date the pixel 2 was amazing and the only reason I changed was a smashed screen which I had repaired once before. The build quality does not feel as strong as the pixel 2 however it does have a great feel in your hand and with a screen protector and case which I have the Google case it feels decent. The camera is great and gets good shots anywhere however should never replace a camera. It's very user friendly and easy to get around the phone and as always Google is great at keeping things organized and relatively simple.I would say the quality is great however I was very spoilt having a pixel 2 and although the phone is well price if you have a older Google pixel probably not worth upgrading unless it's damaged. Hope Google carry on making great devices and don't cut corners and also keep things in a good price range.",
            "Love this phone, it just works... I've really embraced the Google experience with nest, home speakers and switches etc. So it works flawlessly with all that.Like some of the little handy functions and bought the Google buds which seemlessly intagrate with the phone.The best bit has to be the battery life which is impressive, along with the battery share genius this is a true iPhone killer in my opinion!",
            "Amazing phone with an amazing camera. Does everything I need for work and social with ease. Doesn't get hot with multiple apps rubbish and will performs well.\n\nThis phone has exceeded my expectations.",
            "If you want:Best battery life, Best point and shoot (in all conditions), Best fingerprint set up,Best one handed operationBest software experienceThis is it.",
            "This phone is fast due to a great cpu, and it's excellent for trying to catch a bus, very accurate, even warns you your bus stop's approaching whilst on your journey. Great camera with motion if you want it too. Fab keyboard. Overall the phone is a cracker and I'm really pleased I got it.",
            "Phone is great and pick up service was fast and efficient.",
            "Great phone, fast and great battery life. Love the 90hz screen",
            "Great price for a high calibre luxury smart phone.\n\nGood looks, beautifully edged screen, smooth and quick functionality. \n\nPerfect ❣️\n\nGreat photography",
            "Google Pixel 5 is fantastic! Amazing performance, great cameras, beautiful screen and the purest form of Android that you can buy.",
            "No real benefits to upgrading to this phone from a Pixel 4XL, infact it feels like a downgrade.",
            "Historically always had a google phone. Since before Pixel. Last upgrade decided to try something else. Big mistake. I’ve paid to get out of my contract",
            "I have moved from a pixel 3 to a pixel 5. The camera, sound and screen ateao much better. The only thing I miss is the pinch to load Google assistant. On my old handset a simple pinch would load my assistant so I could ask Google directions or anything similar. The 5 lacksthis function. That said it's a great upgrade and will make mestay loyal to the pixel for a long time to come",
            "I did a lot of research before buying this Pixel 5. It did not disappoint, the camera is stunning, performance is excellent, apps run really smoothly, integration with the Google ecosystem is excellent, eg photos go straight into the Google Photos app, and synched straight away, no need for a \"gallery\" app. Overall delighted with the phone, even has wireless QI charging, reviews on that aspect are mixed but I found it charges fine if it out it in the little QI shelf in my car.",
            "The phone is a nice size easy one hand use screen looks good and fast and you know you are guaranteed software updates would recommend",
            "I was skeptical to get an android phone after owning and iPhone for over 10 years but how wrong I was! \nThis phone is absolutely brilliant! Lots of battery life (so far almost 24h heavily using it) easy to navigate, amazing camera that takes breathtaking pictures. Overall I'm absolutely happy with it. The only downside is the graphics, obviously not as sharp as an iPhone but it doesn't compromise the phone in any way. Can't recommend it highly enough!",
            "Was getting fed up with big and heavy form factor phones. The smaller size and 6\" screen of the Pixel 5 is fantastic and easily allows single handed use when navigating and messaging etc. It is also extremely lightweight at only 151g - the combined weight of mine with a case and SP is 170g. The 90Hz refresh rate ensures buttery smooth navigation. The battery life has also been great so far and I have been getting about a day and a half from a full charge. The wireless charging is also handy.",
            "A very good ok phone;\nSuper fast,\nVery long battery life,\nFeels food,\nFairly priced for what it offers.\n\nWill take a few days to figure out how to use it, like any new phone, especially if moving from a different brand, but once you do you will really like it.",
            "Great battery life it lasts almost 48hrs between charges.\n\nBeing a bit smaller at only 6\" it fits perfectly in the hand & is easier to use than the larger phones.\n\nCamera takes great photos even in nightlight.",
            "It was really nice and I got it very fast. I opted for pick and collect and i got it in the nearby store.",
            "It is easy and nice. I would like to recommed my friends as well.",
            "Simple, raw Android experience. Great camera & battery life.",
            "Absolutely over the moon with my purchase. Especially happy with the incredibly fast click and collect option. You've gained a future buyer after a very poor service from Currys. \n\nCould not be more happy. 10/10",
            "I have been an iPhone user for a decade now. I was a little concerned about having to learned a new system. But I have found the pixel 5 to be intuitive and has great features. It's also cheaper than the top model iPhone. I tried to buy one from Currys but my order kept getting pushed back so eventually cancelled it and ordered it from Argos, and picked it up the same day. Can't fault it!",
            "Fantastic little phone, very quick with the 8GB RAM, plus good storage 128Gb also comes with wireless charging too. Would recommend.",
            "Fantastic device for the price, for the same specs on devices who's company names rhyme with \"Chapple\" and \"Jam son\" it would cost basically twice as much.\nEasy to use, my Wife loves it. She is not using the Google assistant function so I am unable to attest to it's usefulness - though I am sure it is brilliant at listening and aiming ads at you so would recommend turning this off!\n10/10 in book.",
            "Yes it is a good phone. Would recommend it. Very fast phone. It has some iPhone features.phone looks good on a in pro case cover.",
            "For what I paid it is really fast.\n\nGood build and delivered quick to",
            "Excellent product with good value",
            "Nice looking phone and very easy to use . Love it",
            "The sleek design screams elegance and the phone build allows the user to have a firm grip. The display is OLED which gives it that extra punch of vibrant colour. The phone is very quick in charging, which is a benefit to me as I am always on the go! With 128GB, space is definetly not going to be a issue which is a bonus! Finger print scanner is a time saver when shopping. The android operating system never disappoints, very snappy as expected from a trust worthy company!",
            "Packaging is very minimal and eco friendly for the most part.\n\nPhone arrives with 80+% battery.\n\nSetup was easy especially with the included dongle.\n\nScreen is amazing, bright, vibrant and brilliant even for gaming or watching movies.\n\nBattery lasts an extremely long time(with the correct settings)\n\nThe textures of the phone make it really grippy but it would be better if they supplied some sort of case.\n\nFull of features and future proof for the next few iterations of Android",
            "Great little google phone, always liked android, this is the best of the bunch. Cameras and software amazing, with the software being automatically updated for 3 years. Excellent for battery use, and it tells you when the battery will approximately run out in real time. The back is non slip, which is a huge bonus if waiting to get a case. Only downside is that there's no earphone point, I'll have to upgrade to bluetooth earphones.",
            "I'm very impressed with the GooglePixel 5. It charges super quick, lightweight, has a 6 inch OLED screen, and has a massive RAM of 8GB! It looks exquisitely sleek and modern! It was so easy to transfer all my apps, contacts, pics, files etc from my old phone and took no time at all to set up. The dual camera is pretty awesome and has many unique features; it really is quite difficult to take a bad photo with this phone! Super impressed that it has wireless reverse charging too! Big thumbs up!",
            "This is just the right size for a phone, so can use it one handed. It looks great and has a far better battery than the pixel 4, plus it is raw andriod and you always get the latest updates on it. Very happy with it.",
            "Great phone. Very pleased coming from a previous iphone.",
            "Very happy with this pure version of Android and sleek design, has everything I want in a phone without any excess that is Nr posting extra for. Definitely a focus on top notch software from google, rather than fancy hardware.",
            "Absolutely love this phone. Always loved Android and this is the best of the bunch so far. Had been waiting for it to come back in stock when I saw it appear in a local Argos. Over the moon with my purchase :)",
            "I got this as an upgrade to the pixel 3a XL for to the reviews about battery life, camera, processor etc.  I wish I hadn't bothered. The 3a XL was every bit as good. Basically the pixel 5 is a smaller version of a few of its predecessors. If you already have a pixel from the 3 range onwards don't waste your money",
            "What a great phone! Lots of new features and great valuw",
            "top stuff from Google, not the fastest but everything else flies and the camera/software is amazing.\n\nonly neg is argos claimed it had a headphone port - it doesnt!"
