            "The phone takes great pictures, has an intuitive operating system but the battery life is rubbish. I'd only had the phone a couple of days and found myself charging it twice a day. I changed a load of settings to help with the battery life and it seems to be a bit better. I shouldn't have to do this on a brand new phone",

Great picture, powerful processor.  sometimes I steal my wife's phone and play Call of Duty Mobile because my old phone couldn't handle it.  Good cameras take pictures in dark places.  I found a promotional price.  £ 100 cheaper.  I picked up the phone the next day.  Reliable service during a pandemic.  I highly recommend",

            "A bit disappointed in this phone ,as supposedly a contender for a premium phone ,this just does not cut it with me ,build quality fair disappointed though I am so used to a phone that's all glass back and front ,but also water and dust proof ,just got android 11 update ,which I already had on my pixel phone .if you don't mind a plastic back then this is not a bad phone",
            "Quick and lots of new features to use. Just wish was a bit smaller",

            "Very happy with this phone. It has a bright, clear screen which is very easy to use and useful features. Plus if you had a previous Samsung phone,  you can easily switch your information from your previous phone,  which is very useful and being android,  you can do the same with your Google apps account. The camera is very good and takes clear shots. It's responsive and quick.  The only downside for me is the fingerprint sensor doesn't appear to be as responsive as my previous S9 Plus and it's on the front, which is more faffy.  Otherwise,  I love the S20 FE.",
            "Good size, easy to use. Only had I for short time so still have to figure out some things. Great at taking pictures ( good quality) . Only thing I would say is battery life but that could be because I am using it to figure things out.",
            "Does what I want, make calls, sends messages, Internet plus more without any drama. A great upgrade from s7",
            "I absolutely love the cameras, they are amazing! Would be cool if you could make the home page etc a bit more your own style.",
            "The phone is slick, fast, does it all at a much more reasonable price. I have always had the flagship but decided this time I did not need it. The S20 FE does it all though. I am sure I am missing something of the flagship but as I don't know it is absolutely fine.",
            "Love the phone battery usage goes quickly though when it's connected to the buds. Over heats whilst on video calls too.",
            "It looks great and has all you could possibly need in a phone and more. Its super fast and I love all the extra security because I do alot of online shopping and banking. There's more than enough storage and a great big screen which I like. It also has 3 cameras to give great pictures. I Would definitely recommend this phone",
            "Good phone. Poor battery and heats up excessively and the charge is slow. Sent phone back and got it replaced still does it on this one. Love the design though its spot on",
            "This is the most annoying phone Samsung has ever made. Email app keeps giving up, you need to uninstall then reinstall to make it work for another couple of weeks. Bixby button instead of power button! Why? Bixby is utter junk! Drop it! It's voice recognition is terrible compared to Google assistants. The finger print scanner on this phone is utterly useless.\nThe older phones had an app button that took you to your apps. Now you have to do a series of kungfu like finger swipes all over the screen to find that you're still in the wrong place.",
            "I like this phone because of hole punch camera at the top of the screen and how you can make the screen bigger when you are taking a photo or you are watching something on your phone. I also like the fast charging on the phone as well.",
            "Great phone as expected from Samsung. Marked down only because battery life is so poor. My S6 which I upgraded from had better battery life!  Apart from that the S20 is perfect, amazing features and pics are stunning quality ! Thank you.",

I  WOULD  RECOMMEND  THIS  PHONE  TO  A  FRIEND  PROVIDED  THESE  FEATURES  ARE  ADDED  TO  NEXT  PHONE ,  AND  I  WOULD  WARN  THEM  TO  THIS  FACT .\n\nTHERE  IS  ONE  OTHER  PROBLEM  WITH  THIS  PHONE ,  WHEN  TYPING  AND  YOU  WANT  TO  PRESS  THE  SPACE  BAR ,  YOU  ACCIDENTALLY  PRESS  THE  HOME  KEY ,   WHICH  IS  LOCATED  DIRECTLY  BELOW  THE  SPACE  BAR .\n\nOTHERWISE  ITS  A  GOOD  MOBILE  .\n\nPERHAPS  IF  THE  KEY  BOARD  WAS  RAISED  UP  ABOUT  HALF  AN  INCH ,  TO  CLEAR  THE  HOME  KEY .\n\n\n\nii )",

            "I like my easy to use S20 FE. Touch screen works fine with a screen protector. Great features.",
            "Perfect. Does everything you need.",
            "Back of the phone has a thin casing - but this can be compensated using a good case.\nBattery life could be better - but you can downgrade the screen to make the battery last longer.  Perfect phone for the money.",
            "I have researched a lot before going for this FE phone and have no regrets.",
            "Difficult to review it myself as I am not using it. All looks good so far, fast operation, great display and photos.",
            "Love it..overall great performance. Glad I came back to Samsung.",
            "Upgraded from the s9 to the s20 Fe 5g and what an upgrade!! Loving the bigger screen the 120htz refresh rate. The 3 cameras on the back take so much better pictures then the s9. And the one ui is amazing software",
            "Fantastic device, solid construction, attractive design, advanced features combined with value for money equals a sure thing.",
            "Don't see many differences to my Samsung Galaxy s10E except the size. The Camera with the flash on was certainly clearer on the s10E. This one leaves a cloudy photo.  It also doesn't have a button to turn it off, it's done on the phone and slightly more difficult to screenshot. Apart from that the phone's alright but would just stick to the s10e myself!",
            "Samsung s20 FE is nice handset big screen also camera is clear photos",
            "I love this device\nI've never had anything so modern!\nThe only things that I am not so happy with is how close together the backspace, enter and space bar are as I often press the wrong button (but that's a real bottom of the barrel issue). The other thing is that because it doesn't have a headphone jack you either have to buy corded headphones that plug into the charging port or get wireless ones. I would've liked at least a corded pair included with the device...",
            "No not superman, click & collect.Ordered at 12am picked up next day. As for the phone great price, excellent camera,display and a choice of pin, fingerprint, face recognition. My wife loves it. It comes with pre fitted screen protector. Samsung rocks..!!!!",
            "I love Samsung pay, I don't have to take my bank cards with me everywhere!",
            "Great features, gorgeous screenz fab camera and all at a very reasonable price point.",
            "I love everything about my new phone and as you would expect from samung it's nice clean lines, it's beautiful crystal clear screen and it's fast processing. The new camera is great for taking pictures in day light and just as good in the evening light it has very good storage which you can double with a micro sd card there's so much more to this phone I've not discovered yet so all in all a great product",
            "I am very happy with S20 FE it has exceeded my expectations. Especially  with big screen",
            "I am still getting use to it but the basics of the phone 2 my s8 are the same . but i would of liked the option of a plug in port for earphone than just bluetooth.",
            "The volume is very poor. If you are talking to someone you need the volume full blast whilst on loud speaker and it is still difficult.",
            "Great camera,good sound quality,easily accessible features",
            "Samsung S20 FE was purchased at full price but the battery does not last a full day, very disappointing.",
            "The s20 fe, feels lighter in the hand, and much quicker in it applications.",
            "I miss not having finger print sensor on the back like my old S9+ and it's missing heartbeat sensor which I used a lot to keep track of my health as I'm now 50 years old. I have been a long term Samsung user.",
            "Fantastic phone with top tech features but at a great price. Flagship phone, non flagship cost.",
            "As a whole i love the phone, especially the camera.\nHowever the two areas that i dislike that are different to the S7 Edge and also my last mobile the S9 are the settings when a pop up screen opens, such as for a text message. The settings for these are in a tiny thin line at the top of the screen which are very impractical. \n\nSecondly call and especially ring tone. Who actually thinks the tones on this phone are good? Most of them are not practical.\nI used to have a different generic tone for texts; calls, WhatsApp messages and notifications. However how these phones have been programmed make that so difficult to achieve. I wanted to add one specific tone to a WhatsApp group thought i had set it as such but in fact every app sound changed. Yet again why change from a previous model that worked to a new method that is more complicated? To make matters worse i the had to go through all apps on notifications to individually set. But this was not easy as when swapped settings from old to new phone tones were not included. Why??\nI then had to go through each contact, each whatsApp chat, each text message to edit settings. Yet again not simple.\nPhone are supposed to get easier and not harder like in these ways.\nI have always been  Samsung and Android apart from initial few Nokia in late 90's but if Samsung and Android keep over complicating how we use them to cheapen the software after adding more expensive apps i may go elsewhere next time!!\nYou have good features on phones so why make the usage in other ways harder?",
            "I got the S20 FE as a second choice because the Plus was out of stock, and it's the best decision i could have made. \n\nMy main requirement was the camera quality and despite *only* having a 3x optical zoom the software in the FE more than makes up for it. There's no comparison compared to my previous device, a Huawei P20 pro, which is better on paper. \n\nOther than that the FE is fast, the screen is bright and samsung OS is intuitive.",
            "Absolutely in love with the features and size of phone. So easy to use would never go back to iPhone again",
            "The phone run fast and seem great. But no headphone jack means I can't charge and listen to music unless I buy Bluetooth headsets when I have perfectly good wired item. If you use an adapter to listen to music there is a contact ticking noise in the background seems to be a constant problem with Samsung phones. Spoils a great phone",
            "The phone is easy to use I transferred all my data easily the camera is amazing everything you would expect from Samsung",
            "I have never had a Samsung before so I didn't know what it works be like but I actually love it its just like an iPhone but better in so many ways.",
            "Upgrade from galaxy note 9 to samsung s20 and i am happy with the new device",
            "The phone is fast and responsive with a great screen. Generally like the Android interface, especially on Sony Phones but Samsung clutters their interface and customises it way more than is needed. their own-apps are also not that great. So if you are willing to spend some time initially to de-clutter the UI its a great buy.",
            "Its a very good phone",
            "I JUST LOVE IT, IT IS REALLY A PERFECT SMARTPHONE!\nthe colors are FAB!\nBattery is mindblowing, literally lasts all day long and the price is super cheap.",
            "It's so responsive I couldn't believe it, I had always used a different model of phone before this and it was slow, but I didnt realise how slow until got I this one. My old phone was coming up to 4cyears old but this seems faster than my old one new. So many things to do and learn with this I'm still figuringing out some of the functions",
            "Very satisfaid y love argos",
            "Very good phone.battwry life is about 24 hours .very nice designe. High recomended",
            "Amazing phone, nice design very fast amd best camera ever!",
            "Bought as a present and greatly received as a samsung upgrade. Easy to use and stylish in design.",
            "I love this phone! \nFirstly the lavender pink is so pretty! The back of the phone isnt glossy either so doesnt harbour fingerprints which is brill! \nAfter always having samsungs this was my next newest upgrade.\nGreat value for money.\nLower in price but doesnt lower the quality of the phone.\nThe Cameras are top! all feautures are easy to use and fast!\nThe under screen fingerprint scanner is a fab feature and makes it so easy to quickly unlock your phone unlike on my previous samsung S9+.",
            "Not impressed with this phone...The plastic back is not nice given the price. The battery life is very poor. The phone call quality isn’t very good. I have a few apps that keep opening by themselves, even when I’ve closed all apps down before turning the phone off, this is not only irritating but battery draining. Cameras are ok but not as good as my previous phone. the screen is clear and a nice size. It is a nice looking phone but I do feel like I’ve downgraded rather than upgraded.",
            "The phone looks great but hasn’t been set up yet as it’s a Christmas present and I think it’s a great one looks brilliant tho and a nice size phone to very happy",
            "Be careful not to drop it as could break. Get nice case and keep looking new"
