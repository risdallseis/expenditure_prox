Screen excellent - great colour, resolution and refresh rate (very smooth scrolling). Stereo sound is  amazing for the size of the device. No issues with connectivity on WiFi, BT and NFC.",

It is light weight, the battery will see you through the day, it has a great screen and speakers and what Google can drag out of a camera is outstanding! All of this in such an affordable package too. It might not be the latest phone but at this price point it is one of the greatest phones.",

            "I have been the laughing stock of my family and friends for not having a good phone but this has brought me right upto date. Everything I need, and more is in this phone and I will now have to find a new way to get laughs. Great features, camera and display. My only grumble was having to buy a car charger as it didn't have a standard compatible lead for the car or information regarding USB Types and adaptors. It took awhile finding the right one due to lack of information. Set up was very easy and it did come with a lead to transfer my info from my old phone. Would recommend without hesitation.",
            "I am very happy with my new phone Pixel 4a, it was so easy to transfer all the data and photos from my old phone to the new one. The Pixel 4a is great value for money compared other well know phones and is just as good if not better. Very Happy",
            "Very pleased with new phone, small size, good battery, excellent camera, better screen. Google's guidance on the 4a phone was very useful.",
            "Always had a Samsung galaxy phone before upgrade and now have a pixel 4a and it's quicker with great memory",
            "Absolutely love my phone easy to use and everything I need , just the right size.",
            "Absolutely love my phone easy to use and everything I need , just the right size.",
            "Good phone, easy to use and setup and nice size.Battery doesn't last as long as some phones, but easily sees me through the day.",
            "The phone is spot on, went from a iPhone 11pro to this phone, and to me it's better, simple, but does everything well, I love it!",
            "Very pleased with this phone, easy to use and better battery life is better than I phone.",
            "For several years I've chosen Motorola Moto G phones as the best budget Android phone, with the cleanest version of the Android experience. This time I opted to try the Pixel approach and I'm glad I did.Great size, super responsive, great camera. There's not much that this does that that many other phones do, but at this price few do it so well. If you're a fan of Android and don't want fluff to get in the way, this is the phone for you.I'm a Pixel convert.",
            "Absolutely love my new phone. Easy to use for an oldie like me. Lots of great features and all my data from old phone was easy to recover. Lots more storage too.",
            "The phone has serious heating issues . I have not seen any other phone heating as much on a video call. I am not a gamee so havnt tried it while gaming but my guess is itll heat up significantly, otherwise the phone feels good",
            "Is a very adaptable phone to use am impressed there were a few surprises with freedom of entry by sites I didn't want to be in touch with but the virus cleaning facilities have cleaned them up was unsure how they got in",
            "Recently upgraded from a Samsung S10e and I find this phone much better in a lot of ways.",
            "A very good purchase to say the least. More than I expected.",
            "This has been the hardest phone to get used to iv ever had. All sorted now but will go back to a Samsung next time. There was Avery limited stock in the shop when I called in and wanted as near to an A40 as possible. It's the quickest iv been in and out of an EE shop when upgrading due to covid restrictions",
            "A nightmare to use. Not sure why they have removed home buttons. I will get rid of this phone asap.",
            "Great value. Easy to set-up. Has everything I need.",
            "Rating a phone this highly is not something I expected to be doing, but having owned phone from other manufacturers, what the Pixel 4a offers for its price is incredible. Transferring my data from a previous non Pixel phone was very simple.I love the pixel UI, the built in guides when you use the phone for the first time is beautifully designed. The camera is outstanding. If a premium phone is something you cannot afford, I highly recommend giving this phone consideration. Happy customer.",
            "I really like the phone, I honestly think its one of the best phones out there with an incredible price as well. However the two things I would like to change about the phone is, 1. Have a one handed mode, I used to have a redmi note 7 and it had a one hande mode which was really handy as I normally use a phone with one hand and 2. a change of emojis. Honestly hate them so go and use the android ones or maybe have a design change?",
            "Didn't want an phone complicated by manufacturers need to overlay their own software over already excellent android software. THis phone is pure android as it should be and is a delight to use. The camera is the best I have used on any phone.",
            "Quick, sleek and all you need!Stock android and very smooth.Compact phone perfect for your pocket",
            "I was a Samsung acolyte for many years. Got a Pixel 4A last week and I have been blown away at how good it is.It's a phone that learns how you use it and adapts itself to give you a better user experience.Sounds mental, and it is. But trust me this phone is the best I've had.",
            "The phone is lovely, sensible size, full of features and works well. The only problem is that it is packed with embedded Google features that I don't want, don't like and don't need snooping on my every move. Can't find a way to escape most of them so Off Grid this phone certainly isn't and nor will you be. I guess we are used to being watched wherever we go nowadays but this phone takes it to extremes. I guess it's a bit like living in China with Big Brother monitoring your every move. Sad.",
            "Always had android phones and for me this is the best I've had. Easy to use, loads of storage ( 128GB) so I can put all my apps on and still have a large amount of storage left. The camera is amazing, still learning about all the fab stuff it can do. And this little bundle of joy connects to all my other Google tech which is great, even my chrome book. I'm one happy Google pixel 4a customer",
            "Thought it might be a step back from a flagship phone, but it's absolutely superb just a good device, well executed, exactly what I need.",
            "Easy to use, good quality camera, and a lot faster than my previous phone, an old LG android. Highly recommend",
            "I purchase this phone as an upgrade from my Huawei p30 lite, however within 48 hours I had returned to my old handset. Nothing on the phone is intuitive - there is no silent mode, do not disturb is for either everything or nothing, navigating out of apps is almost impossible without a back button, and everything bottlenecks with the intrusion of Google accounts linking constantly across apps. The hardware may measure up, but the software is found wanting...",
            "I've only had one previous Pixel, the original and it served me well until the  battery started to show its age. I considered the 4a, but a tight budget had me buy something else and it was a good phone, if too large, but where it couldn't match my old Pixel was the camera (and it was almost too heavy for my gimbal). A turn of fortunes and I jumped at the 4a 5G. While it might not feel as 'premium' as my old one, there's little doubt that this is an upgrade. The jump from Android 10 to 12 beta3 was smooth enough and the new tricks are pleasing and useful.Naturally the cameras are fantastic. I can't wait to start filming some live gigs with it soon. I record my audio separately, but this seemed to do a good job with my hi-fi cranked up, so clean sound will make it easier to sync with.It's good to be packing a Pixel again.",
            "It is a great little phone. Compact but not too small, fast, responsive, the camera is very good. Its less customisable than previous phones and I wasn't keen on the new gesture interface at first, but I now prefer it to my old phone and have changed my work phone to match. The dual speakers are really good too. The only negative is battery is a tad small for me. I can still make it through a day, but my last couple of phones had nearly double the battery size, the trade off was they were slower, heavier and the screens weren't as tough.",
            "Good basic smart phone but short of a few items that leave it a little short of other makes",
            "Pros: Compact, fast and smooth interface, clean android 11 with no bloat-ware, awesome camera, and a headphone jack, really nice OLED screen which is great for YouTube/ Netflix etc, slim build which feels good in the hand, battery lasts all day and the charging speed is incredibleCons: plastic build, not so good when it comes to gaming, slightly outdated chipset although plenty fast for everyday tasks,video quality isn't quite as good as photo quality but it is still good.All in all a high quality phone for the price, you get everything you need, and no more. It's fast, has a great camera and all day battery with garunteed updates from a highly acclaimed company. Strongly recommend.",
            "Like my new phone , excellent,works well does everything I want a phone to do.",
            "Pros \nAmazing camera truly great\nGreat screen/ fast charging/ good download speeds/ good value for money\n\nNeg\nBattery doesn't last as long as some other phones for this price. I do use it alot, so for others will be fine general use and watching battery should last a day\n\nScreen brightness could be better",
            "You can't go wrong at this price point. Transferring from old phone was faultless. Camera is excellent. Does everything I need as an average user. Should be good for a years to come.",
            "I love this phone a brilliant camera and easy to ise",
            "Good value for money. Does all I want from a mobile device",
            "Work's well and robust at a sensible price what more could you want.",
            "Phone is good for the price, it has a bigger battery then the iPhone 12 yet it is somehow 1/5 of its price. Can't explain enough how much of a good price this phone is",
            "I always wanted compact design phone which is east to pocket and handle This one is just that",
            "Great phone for the money. Brilliant camera and great android experience",
            "Excellent size, build, and materials. Just needs to be water resistant (not proof) like other budget mobiles. Software side is awesome, great battery life once it gets use to your usage and the camera is the best. Only wish they had a shortcut toggle on lock screen for the torch and you could use the space bar to scroll through text input, just like iPhone. Other than that much better than iPhone imo. Enjoy all!",
            "Really impressed with the Google Pixel 4A. Would definitely recommend!",
            "Lovely phone with an excellent camera, does everything well.",
            "Screen cracked on the first day. If it is that delicate it should come with a basic case.Camera is really good and phone works like a smart phone. Even with a cracked screen it feels like a slight upgrade from my 5 year old Samsung with an uncracked screen.",
            "Never going back to Samsung's, Huawei's or iPhones really liking my Google phone wish I would of got one sooner",
            "Excellent in every way except battery life disappointing. Camera superb.",
            "It's good in many way's, only not sure how to screenshot at the moment",
            "First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to the high storage capacity, security functions such as fingerprint scanner, which works amazingly well and not only that but the quality of the camera is wonderful. Another thing that I like about the phone is that its quite light and easily fits into your pocket comfortably making it easy to travel with and the screen has a great display and is very responsive and doesn't lag like previous phones I've had and not only that but it's not difficult to use and I also believe it's very user-friendly.Finally I would conclude, that this is a very affordable phone, that is the best on the market in it's price range and is suitable for either Techies and none Techies a like.",
            "Fabulous phone at a fraction of the cost of my previous one. So easy to set up and use.",
            "Great, affordable, has massive memory, google thankyou ! Just the job, phone handles 365 office apps, which load quickly, clear sensitive screen, easy to navigate functions. very pleased with this entry level phone, why pay more.. when this phone has more.",
            "My new phone doesn't have an intuitive User Interface, lots if tricky swipes to learn and they are not always recognised by the OS.The product is good, but more consideration needed for users.",
            "Quite easy to use once you get used to the swiping. Camera is great. If you have had a Samsung in past or other Android this is a good switch and you won't be disappointed.",
            "The only down side is that it's not wireless ly chargeable.",
            "Generally very happy with the phone but battery life is a slight concern and I'm not sure the camera is as great as most reviews say, I am finding quite a few artefacts even without using the digital zoom.",
            "Upgraded from a 3a XL, really miss the back button at the bottom of the screen. As well as the swipe up function to see different running apps. The 4a has two functions that clash when you swipe up and isn't good usability",
            "Great phone,just as good as a Samsung , can't believe how good and easy it is to use.",
            "Excellent phone so far . Great size and weight.! Would recommend to anyone.",
            "I got this to replace a 3 year old Samsung J3, so nothing fancy. Yet my old, slow J3 still outperforms this phone with the exception of the camera.I can not get the phone to ring or alert me when sound and/vibrate is on, s keep missing calls. Videos usually crash after about 90 seconds. There are very few camera functions, although the average image capture is pretty good. There is no option for another image folder, only google photos, and I don't want all my pictures automatically updated to a cloud. Wish I'd never bought it.",
            "Very impressed so far with phones speed and features.",
            "I was a bit terrified to change my phone because i am not very technically minded. But it is fantastically easy to use. The camera is unbelievably good. The only thing is that its a bit small but its fine for me. I can enlarge the font so no problem.",
            "Excellent small handset with the advantage of having easy links to my Google account.",
            "Great phone at a great price, can't fault it. Looks good and works even better",
            "Really happy I chose the pixel 4 5gIts fast, has clear screen, no bloatware and the camera is brilliant.  I am also surprised by the ai features that make life with phone better.Th",
            "Can't fault this phone at all so far, first Pixel I have owned...don't think I'd ever look elsewhere for a phone again. Stunning camera, it just doesn't take bad photos. Camera was important to me with a 9 month old I want to capture lots of memories and this phone won't disappoint. Battery life is stunning, nearly 48 hours for me! All round use is fast and fluid. Nothing negative to report! Thanks Google I am now officially Team Pixel!",
            "Nice sleek phone, crisp camera good functions also practical apps via Google for work and leisure.  Very impressive good useful phone.",
            "I love the ease if use for this phone. Battery life is good. The camera is amazing especially the night sight. Highly recommended",
            "Had a few Google pixels over the years right back to the Nexus 4 this one is by far the best I've ever owned. Love the size small phone but still 5.8\" screen. The features are fantastic and the camera is amazing. The phone is a joy to use. It's very nippy and more than enough for most people's needs. Get one!!",
            "This is my second Google pixel phone, even better than the last.",
            "Enjoying my Pixel 4a very much, particularly the quality of photos it takes. Also the sound quality that comes out of such a small device, without headphones, is amazing.",
            "Absolutely delighted with this phone. Had first Gen Pixel for about four years now and decided it was time for an upgrade. For the price this is a brilliant phone. The step up in specs, features and performance are excellent. I've had the phone two weeks now and haven't found a thing that disappointed or gave me regret about the upgrade. Amazing phone, great price. If you're considering upgrade from earlier Gen Pixel but don't want to pay top cost for the pixel 5 then this is the option for you.",
            "I've only had this phone for a few days but I am really enjoying it so far. Compared to my old phone, it's way faster and the camera is phenomenal. Would recommend to anyone wanting to try out a Google phone.",
            "Excellent phone at good price changed back to Android from I phone",
            "I am a long time Iphone user so the move to a Google Pixel 4a has been a challenging one for me personally. However I can honestly say I am enjoying the phone, it has the following list of pros that I am enjoying most:The camera is unreal, so good and a lot of features I wouldnt expectThe speed is rapid, I have no lingering between apps or performance of high CPU demanding apps including games that need decent graphicsThe phone is configurable to my needs, it has some very good intuition that if you allow it to get to know your use then it shapes how and what it does for you to match 5g compatible which is useful (when i find a signal) Slightly smaller than the XR which is a good thing IMOThe way that the OS groups the apps is far more aesthetically easy to view and navigate than the IOS equivalent. All in all I am liking the phone and although I miss the XR it is becoming something I miss less and less :)",
            "Google have produced a quality product at a reasonable cost giving me all the features I need without being complicated.",
            "Simple small unit that does the key things well and a lot more beside. Easy set up and no bloat ware.",
            "Compact, really nice feel. Free from any bloat, very clean. Camera software is second to none. Phone is far more than the sum of its specs, Google have thought a lot about how to make the 4a a pleasure to use.",
            "Not a bad phone but have constant problem's with it not recognising the SIM card and have to turn off several times a day",
            "Really good value for money. Really happy with the phone and its camera is outstanding. I can play games as well. But a little bit downside is it's processer. 6 GB and 128 GB storage is good and unlimited google photos storage.",
            "I was treated very well by the young lady in store.She  and advised me and was very confident.",
            "Great phone considering the money I paid. Will always go for any phone that gets first updates, no bloatware etc. And this has not disappointed. Little smaller than I'm used to but fidelity makes up for that. Would recommend to anyone",
            "This is a very decent budget device everything works fast and snappy. I would say camera is the strongest asset here didn't found anything wrong yeat. Battery file is good to.",
            "Takes some getting used to since it operates differently from my last phone( Samsung galaxy)I'm not used to not having a back button with everything now controlled by swiping.A very sleek phone!",
            "Thoroughly brilliant phone. Good hardware, simple design. Outstanding camera. Builds on the success of the 3a and improves it with its unibody polycarbon body and small form factor.My favourite Google phone since the Nexus 4.",
            "Very happy with this phone. Fast and efficient and battery seems to last for quite some time, better than my old phone. A good priced phone, why pay more! Does everything I want",
            "This is a cheap but well featured phone.Easy to setup and transfer from previous phone.Not top end specifications but good enough for most people.",
            "Generally a decent phone, not weighed down with lots of \"firmware\" that will never be used. Battery life much better than some reviews would have you believe. However, like most so called smart phones, the range of options and layers of setting limits the users ability to fine tune the way the phone interacts - too many choices to navigate",
            "Buttery life could have been better, e-sim not enabled in UK.so I can use only single SIM, no wireless charging",
            "I like a smaller mobile and most important the latest  security updates, this you get with the pixel range.On top of that a great camera",
            "What can I say! A great phone for a great price! .",
            "Putting simply ..why didn't I get a pixel earlier these phones are astonishing and the camera quality especially the astrophotography is incredible!",
            "The 4a is great with a couple of exceptions. The size is perfect for me and I like it's slim profile. What is taking a bit of getting used to however is the swipe to go back function. In apps where you swipe for a feature I keep finding myself back on the homepage. I'm sure I'll get used to it but it's a bit annoying just now. Likewise when I want to minimise the page I keep getting the assistant. I can probably turn that off though and will look at doing that. Overall though I highly recommend this phone.",
            "Google pixel 4a phone is just awesome. .....,........................................................",
            "The phone is good, but seems a downgrade on my nearly 3 year old pixel 3xl. Freezes a tad, if only for a second. Doesn't feel as premium too. It's early days, see how I feel after a month or two.Also, the gestures are weird. I prefer the two button layout and the fast switching of the two most recently opened tabs!Thanks",
            "I was after a smartphone that does not have a massive screen so I can just put it in my jeans pockets, not easy nowadays without buying an older model. The Pixel 4a is an excellent trade-off... the right size for me, in the mid-low range price with a very good camera and the latest Android version. It would be unfair to compare this phone to the top of the class phones that cost double or triple. It has a quite generous storage space with 128GB as well.\nIt has some limits sure (above all the selfie camera is not that great and the CPU sometimes struggle a bit and it makes the experience not very smooth) but, for that price, you need to compromise somewhere.\nOverall I am very happy with this phone and I'd recommend it to a friend.",
            "Had to get a new phone in a rush and this is perfect. Excellent battery life, very fast, clear. I love the gestures to move between screens. Very intuitive. Only gripes, it's a bit small and can be tricky to find apps. Great spec for the price. Recommended",
            "What more do you need, telephoto lens maybe? Otherwise, a smooth phone, compact and fast.",
            "Does a lot, who needs more, is there more?? It set up very easily so was in use in minutes.",
            "I purchased for sim only after reading all the positive reviews and very happy with this mobile! Great camera, lots of storage space and easy to use.",
            "A very good phone that's cheap and does all the stuff modern phones can do.",
            "Much better value for money than any apple phone!!",
            "Best phone I've had ever.It lasts long, functions harder and displays swimmingly.More than enough",
            "Brilliant phone brilliant camera and dual speakers sound better than pixel 5 and brilliant price hopefully will get pixel 6 pro",
            "Great display. Android runs silky smooth. And the camera is of course amazing. Phone feels perfect in the hand. And terrific value for money. I used to use a flagship phone costing more than twice as much but now much prefer this.",
            "Brilliant screen high resolutionCompact strong design Speedy user interface and fast at all tasks you throw at your device gets things done with ease Battery is brilliant Best all round phone for everyday life it will get you through your day simply and easy no hassle just gets the work done. Cameras are high quality best detailed camera with colours accurately showing on the OLED display best for photo sharing to all kinds of social media platforms. The speakers are the best I've heard on a phone extremely loud and bass is deep sounds like a high quality 2 dual speaker system in a compact design phone. Choose Google. Many thanks",
            "Great phone and great battery life. Not had chance to try the 5g yet though.",
            "Loving my new 4a. Slim and elegant. Only small issue is that the brush moves from the corner confuses my games in landscape orientation. In a card game you have to be careful how you play the cards at either end of the hand.",
            "clear and responsive software without any duplicate or uneeded apps from manufacturers, 5G connection fast, excellent camera, best audio and video drivers on android",
            "i just got this for my birthday, its great! Great camera, excellent screen, and minimal packaging.",
            "Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good phone at a great price.",
            "Does not have a load junk you don't need.",
            "I bought this for my wife's birthday and she is delighted with it.\nEverything transferred from her 5 year old Motorola phone no problem \nThis new Pixel 4a charges very quickly",
            "I am so glad I bought this phone. I spent forever doing research and ended up getting this. It has a crazy number of great features- even a safety feature- it is slick, pretty, and just is everything I was looking for. Plus, delivery was fast and great.",
            "Absolutely amazing, lightweight and robust, it's also quick and the image is sharp as anything.  Bought because I was on a budget and needed a new phone, but I have not been disappointed at all, think I will stick to Google phones from now on if they continue to be this good",
            "Cool phone ,great photos,easy to use , light in hand",
            "Small, lightweight and well designed. Does everything I need in a smartphone with the bonus of free image back up on the cloud.",
            "Absolutely love this mobile it's easy to navigate and use the memory and storage on this device is brilliant it does everything that I need it to do. Highly recommended this phone to everyone",
            "My primary interest was a good camera, I sent back a Poco F3 for the terrible camera, saw review sample images of the Pixel 4a and was blown away, couldn't believe they were taken on a phone. Had my Pixel 4a a week now, the camera really is amazing, photos look crisp and detailed  with wonderful colours, contrast, dynamic rance and point and shoot simplicity. I used slrs for years but I had to edit every slr image not so with the 4a, every photo perfect exposure, you don't even usually need to tap to focus unless you want to photos just look amazing. Also use 4a for stadia cloud gaming and native games like asphalt 9 run perfectly too. Phone is quite small but I like that, if I had to point out any weak points, ringtone not very loud, screen not very bright, battery just adequate but left with 20-30% at end of day. The cpu is fast enough, phone is very responsive, 128 gb storage, it's a great phone especially the camera, highly recommended.",
            "Really easy to use with lots of useful functions. I primarily got this phone for its quality camera and it definitely doesn't disappoint. The mic is also great. I love it.",
            "Got the newer 4a which is smaller than my last 4a. Everything has changed and I'm finding it very frustrating to use.Also too sensitive and does things by accident. I want my old one back!!!",
            "I recently had a google pixel 4a from having iphone all my life and it's so much better for everything, the battery life and the the phone to use it's brilliant for me, takes a little she to get used to where everything is compared to the iPhone but I prefer it so much more, definitely recommend.",
            "A good value for money 5g phone with a great camera and pure android with the benefits of regular updates to OS and security with no unnecessary added bloatware.Obviously you could spend a lot more for a fancy looking phone with better specs on paper...BUT, do you actually need to? I suspect this phone is absolutely all the phone most people really need.Certainly works for me... recommended.",
            "Absolutely love this phone. Have had Samsung galaxy's for many years now. But decided to have a change after a week of looking around and asking friends, the Google Pixel 4a with 5g was highly recommend. Easy phone to use and it's beautiful. Would definitely recommend getting one.",
            "Great camera, great display, good to have a 3.5mm jack socket. It would be good to have an expandable memory, though. I've not had this phone for long, but so far so good.",
            "Continues the pixel line in being an excellent phone with great features. Camera is very good despite the hardware being a year or so old. I love the latest version of Android and it's usability.",
            "Screen broke first time it fell out my pocket after having it not even for 9 hours, it's completely broken and now I'm using my old phone again.",
            "Compact, fast, loads of memory space, excellent camera, well pleased.",
            "Decent small phone for the price. Large storage memory which is excellent for all the app downloads nowadays. Battery life decent too.  Reasonable camera pixel quality. One disappointment is it does not have a USB connector for charging with on the charger cable, both ends are the same C connectors?",
            "Premium phone with a 3.5mm headphone port. Camera is one of the best things about the phone.",
            "I got the pixel 4a when I upgraded from the 3a. I expected a better version but the 3a is a far better phone. The 4a battery lasts half the time as the 3a and the phone gets very hot very quickly when in use. Wish I'd kept the 3a",
            "Third pixel I have owned and doesn't disappoint, best yet: fast, clean and compact. Amazing vfm.",
            "I find this easy to use and easy to find help to do so",
            "Switched from a Moto G9 Plus to be sure of getting upgrades. Screen is smaller but just big enough. Nice pocket size.Battery is smaller but easily lasts all day especially if I pop in the car and plug it in for Android Auto. Android Auto seems better since it does not need an unlock. Camera app is the best thing since it is in plain English instead of meaningless icons. I had the Moto for 9 months without realising that the lens could do text recognition.Speakers are better than the Motorola and the WiFi speed on a poor connection seems to be better.Seems to have caller id built-in where I had to use an annoying app on the Motorola.",
            "The phone is excellent ,and just the size I wanted for single handed use, just got to get used to the changes of the Android 11 over my previous A9.",
            "This is the best google Pixel l have had . I am playing with it to learn how to get the best out of it. Having a jack to use earphones is great. The camera is outstanding so good. I was able to use google maps in areas that were very remote and it is so light. Very pleased with this purchase.",
            "I've had the pixel 4 a for a little while now. I like the stock android experience and I am getting used to the smaller 5.8\" screen size as it's smaller than my last phone. It fits in my pocket nicely, the stereo speakers are a nice touch too. A few things I would have liked to have been better are the size of the battery, the camera is good, very good at times but I don't like the waiting for the software to sharpen the image as it goes from sharp to fuzzy back to sharp again. Also the screen doesn't seem to get too bright and it's not the sharpest OLED screen I've owned. Other than these things I am willing to see how this phone goes especially with android 12 coming soon.",
            "Not happy at all with phone. Takes lot of getting used to. Camera could be better. If you're going from IPhone to this to you will struggle",
            "This phone is amazing as it has a great camera lots of cool camera setting and is so easy to use.",
            "All round brilliant phone. Love not having a home button. The only negative for me is that it doesn't support wireless charging. If you're not worried about this then definitely consider buying one.",
            "Great phone. My last phone was a 3 year old flagship model and I'm not intesterested in the latest features (or prices!) on the latest flagships, so I thought I would 'settle' with the Pixel 4a. However, this is far from settling.So far the phone feels like a real step up. It is fluid to use, has a great camera, and battery life looks like it will do a couple of days.Overall a great product I would recommend.",
            "Fantastic phone, decent sized screen, great memory at 128gb, quality camera, simplistic OS and UI. I have upgraded from Google Pixel 3XL and although there isn't massive improvements there are enough to be noticeable. Fantastic phone.",
            "Use to be an iPhone lover and then when the Samsung S7 Edge came out I then stuck with them for a while and bought the Note 8. I then purchased the OnePlus 7T second hand and loved it but battery life became an issue. Sick of flagship phones now and prefer mid-range phones and rather use the extra cash for other thing's.I've heard of the Google Pixel but knew no one with this kind of phone. After looking at the reviews I purchased a brand new Pixel 4a 5g and the price was extremely competitive. Absolutely love it and very minimalistic in style. It took for ever to sync everything to the Pixel but it was so worth the wait. I'm also using Google Pay now. Should have done this years ago! I was really concerned that I would miss out on the 90htz refresh rate which I had on the OnePlus and haven't noticed the difference. I cannot praise this phone enough and I'll be sticking with Google Pixel for quite sometime. Up to date software updates etc....bonus!Love it, Loving life!",
            "Very pleased with my purchase. Having decided to change from an iPhone I was a little apprehensive but everything worked out well. The only minor issue was I was unable to transfer my WhatsApp messages. I found the phone easy to navigate and soon got used to it.",
            "A great phone with fantastic camera. Great value  and on a good tarrif",
            "I used to have an iPhone but after doing a bit of research I decided to buy this Google pixel 4a phone, and I am glad I did! The phone is very easy to use- battery life is really good- the photos are amazing-126g memory-love my new phone!",
            "Photo quality amazing .More advance than previous phone .I found easy to use and navigate around",
            "Nice phone, neat size, great camera, no regrets, really.",
            "Best British phone I’ve bought needed phone to update",
            "Lots of cool features, very convienent with the blue light feature automatically switching off at 2200-0600.Enjoy using this product",
            "Not good using finger on screen no manual push buttons. Have to keep turning it off to get back to home screen wouldn't have another one.",
            "Fantastic phone for the price. Switched from the Galaxy S10 and the Pixel 4a is a worthy replacement. Flagship quality at 1/3 of the flagship price.",
            "Like the phone, ideal size. I wish the always on lockscreen would allow always on when notification land as an option other than just off or on.",
            "Went for this version over 4g because of the battery improvement.   This battery lasts well over a day even with heavy use, so I think it was a good decision.  I've turned off 5g because I don't have a package with this included.  Phone operates in a very premium way.  Love the lack of bloatware.   Only downside so far is that android 11 has knocked off my WiFi.  Really annoying and have struggled to get a solution through Google.",
            "Good budget phone with above average camera and smooth running os. Simplistic but attractive design and for a 2020 phone actually manageable screen size. Love it and would recommend and buy again if given reason.",
            "I have been using this device solely for media work and love the sound and video. Really clean and simple set up. The battery is also very good.",
            "Phone seems enough and a sensible size, almost exactly the same size as a Huawei p10 lite. Battery lasts over a day with a good amount of use, plenty of storage. Regular software updates so should be safe and secure for a a few years.",
            "Bought this recently as the battery life in my old pixel 2 was failing. So far so good. Good features like adaptive charging, good camera, etc. Battery lasts a day which is about as good as it gets with modern phones",
            "I bought this phone a few weeks ago. It has an amazing camera and is fast and is very affordable for it's price. \n\nThe battery life is also decent",
            "I had the pixel 4a a few days, brilliant camera etc, but after a few days, it kept rebooting while charging, Argos was very good at excepting it back and refunding me, Don't let my review put you off buying one, overall it's a brilliant phone, it was just my luck I got a faulty one ,",
            "I was looking forward to getting this phone as an upgrade for my old samsung galaxy s7. Unfortunately I couldn't transfer everything from my old phone to the pixel. Half my photos disappeared and the ones that synced were in a totally random order. I tried cable, wireless and cloud syncing, all of which failed. \nThe date for other android apps likewise failed to transfer \nAlso the phone seemed slow and kept freezing when I was try to use it, did not expect this given my samsung is years older. \nLastly the battery went flat really quickly when I was setting it up which wasn't ideal\nTried to return to argos and explained that I was unable to sync everything from the old to new phone. They said this was my fault as I wouldn't be able to transfer from a samsung. Tried to explain that they are both android and photos are stored in a cloud but was refused a refund which was very frustrating. Now having to try and sell the phone. \nHave bought a new samsung a 52 5g. So much faster, data transferred much quicker and worked first time, battery and screen are so much better. No Brainer!",
            "Loving the phone so far. Can't go wrong with a brand new Pixel phone.",
            "good phone with a great camera and very good battery life",
            "I've had this phone for well over a week now. For a more budget phone this performs as well as any phone I've had, if not better. Took some getting use to the different controls I was familiar too , but I really like how intuitive it is. Camera is awesome. Battery life is spot on- it easily lasts the day with moderate use.",
            "I am still learning how to use the phone, but so far it is brilliant",
            "I like it. Can confirm that it's good, for a good price.",
            "Overall very good. Issues with side swipes when playing games and with the closing of apps. Both very tricky and annoying.",
            "Bought this phone because prices of high end phones are going up all the time and i wanted to see if something bit more budget oriented would still deliver decent experience. Overall well pleased great phone for the price and would recommend to anyone.",
            "very pleased with my new mobile",
            "I bought the Pixel 4a as a replacement for a Pixel 2 once it was on offer. Good performance, memory capacity and an amazing camera/app. I was worried about battery capacity due to some reviews - doesn't seem to be a problem for me - 6 hours into the day after charging and then reasonable use (Facebook, WhatsApp, email etc) it's only down to 94% battery remaining.",
            "... better than my last phone, probably not as good as my next phone...battery life is average to good, not A-mazing though.Lots of nifty features which make life easier.Highly recommended as a mid range mid budget device.4 out of 5",
            "This is my 2nd Pixel and I think it's perfect for what I need. Had it a week now and the only fault, all be it a minor one is the battery. It does the day but with waze or apple music it canes the battery. I understand this will improve as the phone adapts to my usage but a bigger battery would have been ideal. The phone works great and looks smart AF. I like a simple looking phone so this is bang on what I like.",
            "Smart, snappy, very fast, great snap shooter .. love it",
            "I bought a couple of these smartphones for my parents as a wedding anniversary gift, and I have to say that after testing the phone throughout I am really impressed with the quality and performance. Highly affordable and reliable smartphone. I highly recommend it!",
            "Does what I need decent battery and apps    , easy to use single handed",
            "Brilliant phone, I replaced my iphone 6s and find this mobile an excellent replacement, which is more than a match for the iphone 6s apple are due to disgard in the coming months in an vailed attempt to force me and others to upgrade to an extortionate replacement, a failed strategy in my respect",
            "Phone is smooth but Google maps app is very lagging and disappointing. While I was driving the display gave me a notification that this route contains less traffic and then subsequently an option to exit or cancel the message...but it wouldn't cancel and most of the app was pretty unresponsive too. The app also crashed a few time too. The screen wouldn't rotate when I wanted it to. I really had to rotate the screen for an app like YouTube to rotate. Disappointing. I wasn't expecting this from Google stock android phone. It happened to the Samsung S3 all those years ago.",
            "I wanted a small compact mobile phone but I was limited as not much choice.I required that the phone had a reasonable    chip set, screen and camera.  The country is not 5g ready so was happy to accept 4g networks.  The difficult part is using Android 11 as it has lost the the 3 function keys from bottom of the screen.",
            "Great phone so far but not had it long but time will tell",
            "Fast phone and a really nice camera. Keep buying for the 3.5 jack. I hope you never get rid of it Google. You always know you're getting a good phone with a pixel",
            "This is better than my Samsung. More data and storage, much better predictive text and does everything that a Samsung does",
            "Brilliant camera, battery life is a lot better than the pixel 3 last all day with heavy use",
            "Love this phone.Very fast, always on the latest updates.I really like the size of the phone. I think most of the phones just are oversized. This one fits in my pocket, and in my hands.The quality of the images are excellent. The night sight mode is the perfect and the photos are sharp even in low light conditions.The camera also comes with lots of options like 360, fisheye.",
            "It's ok, but disappointed that there's no gallery app for photos on the device. Google Photos is great as a backup but I like to see my photos on my phone.",
            "I loved my Pixel 3a so was very keen to upgrade to the 4a and I wasn't disappointed.  There a few things that are slightly different, but after 1 week I have got the hang of it and love it.  Bonus having double the memory too!",
            "Great device! A lot of value here and the performance of the battery is amazing. I had a Nexus 5x... then a Samsung a8 2018...this one is way better",
            "Coming from Samsung A series it feels more robust. Initial setup was easy but like most it is the little things that take more time. It took me a while to find the home, back and close apps buttons. I am used to buttons and did not really like swiping. A pity the buttons are the opposite way round to the Samsung. Also have not found how to close all apps in one go. The phone seems fast and can be seen in most light. The adaptive brightness is pretty good. Camera seems good although I have not yet really used it. The night site is excellent.Generally I think we will get along fine.",
            "I used this great phone for a couple of days, everything worked well except for making calls.Every time I used the phone I would get a message, Reconnecting reconnecting.The call would drop and then connect again.So I returned the phone, we use mobile phones for everything in our lives , but if the basic phone does not work it is useless",
            "Had the phone for 12 days. Very happy with it. I have always had Samsung Android phones so was apprehensive about changing, but I really did not like my last phone Samsung A70 so chose to upgrade early. Did some research and asked advice from service provider shop. They said Google Pixel 4a 5G was good and the reviews I had read were mainly positive. I'm 55 and want a good camera, an easy phone and a good value package. Don't game or stream films etc. Really like the camera and again it is easy to use. So far I am loving this phone and very glad I chose it",
            "Brilliant sized phone, easily pocketable yet with decent screen. The camera works very well, as indeed does everything else. My surprise favourite feature is the fact that the name of songs playing around me (eg in a restaurant) are shown on the lock screen. Surprisingly useful!",
            "Excellent phone, great screen. Would highly recommend.",
            "Great size and very holdable. Lots of features, very quick easy to figure out and fabulous camera",
            "The pixel line up has improved so much and now it made me move from my old iPhone 8 to the Pixel 4a 5g. Yes it took a while to get used to the giant display, but now I can watch daddy Linus tech tips on a bigger screen and also enjoy Anthony slot his ram into the DIMM slots. It is beautiful. Thanks Google, keep up the good work!",
            "Perfect size. Many phones these days are too big, no longer fitting in a pocket, this one does. Good clear screen and good camera",
            "Fantastic phone, great features, ease of use, battery life, nothing to fault",
            "I bought this phone and I like it very much. Not too big but with wide screen, and can take really lovely photos. It suits my needs perfectly.",
            "Bought this a few weeks ago for my daughter and she is delighted with it. Very easy to use and picture and video quality is so clear. Battery life is also good. Processing speed is very good - well worth it",
            "This is a great phone. We have the pixel 4a and 5. They are really easy to use and migrate to. Love all the google apps and the ease of access compared to that of apple. Love swipe gestures. Would definitely get again and recommend to others",
            "I got mine set up in shop. Not being phone savvy. Without shop help, I think I would have struggled.(why do phone makers not give written instructions anymore?)Had to go back to shop due to being unable to silence notification alerts .Now I'm up and running I'm happy with device. ....... So far so good . I'll keep you posted.",
            "So I read many reviews about the pixel 4a and when my pixel 2 finally died I got the 4a. Safe to say I'm not happy the camera isn't nearly as good l the screen is not smash proof(I've already cracked it) . Over all of you are looking for a cheaper phone to get you through this is fine, but it is no where near what I think it should be.",
            "This phone is wonderful I can easily post stuff on social media without being banned very smooth and easy to use and on my word the camera is superb! Genuinely the best camera I've ever used on anythingHighly recommended phone much better than apple.",
            "I love the phone, it easy to use and has a fab camera on the back. I would highly recommend it to other people",
            "Worth every penny you spend. Most solid software ever.",
            "Takes a bit of getting use to especially shutting down/exiting  or closing an app, no obvious button and a couple of times I thought I had shut down app only to have it running in the background and drain the battery, where the old phone you just pressed bottom right hand side to shut down",
            "When you think what you pay for an iPhone these days even a model or two earlier than the latest. I challenge you to try this phone and see what you get for the price especially the amazing camera. Let's not forget the best operating system Android with all the latest features at your fingertips",
            "The Google pixel 4a does exactly what i hoped it would, it takes superb pictures",
            "Fast. Clear display. Great camera.Battery life not amazing.",
            "I find the Pixel a good. alrounder and excellent value for money",
            "ok so the device is good, not perfect. the fingerprint sensor on the back works well. the screen is nice, the OS works as it should. Battery life is amazing. I was surprised that it didn't have 4k video capture when my oneplus 3t does. other than that it's faultless.",
            "Not had the phone long ...just getting used to it but so far so good......",
            "Does everything you need battery can last up to 2 days without charge super charging is amazing for my daily routine",
            "This phone really is the perfect size and fits well in my hand. It's a shame that putting any case on it, even a very slim one, makes a difference. But that does speak to how well-sized the phone itself is.It's very snappy and the usability on the whole is good. Replacing the navigation buttons with gestures works very well except for the back button, which gets inadvertently gestured far too often when swiping through photos or pages.The lack of LED notification light and face unlock keep this as a 4-star device for me. I know the LED has generally trended away from most phones but to their detriment. Always-on isn't as quickly informative to me. And since fingerprint isn't as reliable as face unlock, especially when you may only have one hand available, I miss this feature as well.It is a good value overall for what you get though I'll probably upgrade it within 18 months.",
            "Kinda annoyed there's no 5g coverage tbh, otherwise, 5*",
            "Once I learnt all the uses found this phone easy to use and navigate between apps",
            "Smaller than most phones but it is really easy to use. Good camera quality. Will do all what you need from it.",
            "Absolutely love my Google phone briefly went back to Samsung after a Google pixel 3a and really didn't get on with it will be Google phones every upgrade for me now.",
            "This is the second Google pixel phone I have owned. Brilliant. Would not go back to any other!",
            "Value for money springs to mind.  Has everything you could want a phone of that price to have and more. Amazing camera as well as features and user interface",
            "Got mine a week ago and have totally loved it, I don't think I'll go back to Samsung the software and experience is just so much better here (•‿•). Awesome Phone !",
            "Quick order and delivery.Easy to set up and use. Would certainly recommend.",
            "Originally owning a pixel 2xl....and then having another phone I decided to go back to getting a pixel.....I have no regrets....things just work smoothly.... system, camera, and updates....pleased in so many ways...got it at a good price and can't put it down....For me I would say the complete phone package at the right price....Not sure I would stray again from the pixel phones.....If you are thinking about a pixel then go for it......",
            "Great phone easy to use as I'm an oldie! Simple set up and a whole new world",
            "I've had the phone for just over a week and am perfectly happy with it. Set up was simple, transferring everything from my previous Pixel 3.I've taken few photographs yet as I've not really been anywhere to do that. However, those I have area clear and sharp.I have no complaints nor faults to report.",
            "I don't like the way you have  come out a app to  to go to another there's no flow",
            "Coming from an iPhone I wasn't expecting much for the price and to be bored like I am with every phone change. Very happily surprised",

            "Simply the beat handset i had in a while. Super fast.No extra bloated appsHappy with Android straight from google.Missing facial recognition.Fantastic camera and surprised by picture quality",
            "Really like the phone for the price. Great pictures and does everything i need it to do. Love the fact is pure Google.",
            "It a smooth process. I like to use ARGOS. The phone quality  - price balance is perfect. It fulfils my expectations.",
            "I rate my 4a as Good value for money. Its a replacement for my 3. Its obviously faster, otherwise not much difference for good or bad. One very annoying tendency it has just like the 3 is resetting alerts to minimum volume. Not withstanding that, the key aspect for me liking the 4a is the camera is excellent and price acceptable for spec.",
            "I purchased this phone as a change from the usual smart phone brands.I was attracted to the price as well as the full Google experience.I'm happy so far however coming from a Huawei I have noticed that the battery life isn't what I expected.I'm a medium to heavy user and I barely get a day out of the phone.",
            "Love the Google Pixel phone and upgraded to the 4a after the 3. Enjoy it just as much with the exception of 1 major flaw which is the navigation. Having to swipe to go back is a major pain especially if you're looking at photos or something. Seems like a clever change not really thought out.",
            "Not a bad phone, however, the battery life is pretty poor compared to previous phones I've had. I'd likely send it back if I could :( it cannot make it through the day without charging. Shame!",
            "Great phone easy to use amazing camera, easy to navigate great contract price used ee shop great service",
            "I was curious about how this phone would work with me and honestly it’s surprised me in every way. The battery is amazing. Comfortable to use. I could go on. One of my favourite phones.",
            "Unfortunately the phone died on me  Seems like faulty battery",
            "Amazing for everything and I can't think of anything else too say",

            "Really reliable stuff. Could maybe be waterproof though.",
            "Larger device makes it easier to type and the speed increase when moving to 5G is awesome.Didn't think I'd be this impressed with a new phone, but here I am!",
            "I came from the Pixel 3 and have been happy with the general  performance of the Pixel 4a, however the battery usually needs to be charged by the afternoon, which is disappointing. The 3 used to last until the evening.",
            "A superb phone. Looks good with great battery life. Argos staff also superb. Very pleased.",
            "Took a bit of getting used to (I am in my late 60's). Very happy with the phone and the picture quality is excellent",

            "I moved to the Pixel 4a from the iPhone 8, chosen over the iPhone XR and I'm utterly thrilled with my choice. The phone runs buttery smooth with no signs of lack or need to wait to refresh.  The camera massively outperforms its stats providing extremely rich and sharp images with true-to-life colours.  The battery is almost impossible to kill. With moderate use including internet browsing, calls, messaging, taking photos and some light gaming I'll go to bed with well over 40% when I'd almost always have to give my old iPhone a little boost most days.  My only complaint is the screen - it is beautifully clear and truthfully better than the iPhone I've moved from, but it does struggle outdoors in direct sunlight and is almost not visible unless the brightness is fully turned up. Google have also added some extremely helpful Google-specific apps including a notes app and google podcast which I find more user friendly and streamlined than both apple podcasts and Spotify.  Thrilled.",

            "Bought as all round phone use it for games calls text interwebs get about 2day battery life",
            "Not that I use my phone as a phone all that much. Maybe once a week.It's the camera that makes me love this \"phone\".  It comes closer to reproducing what I see than any camera I have used. If you love taking pictures this is a \"phone\" to consider.",
            "Perfectly this phone comes along at a reasonable price, meets all your needs with some new features as well. No more apple products for me, google has it all with a stylish package for anybody so come and jump in.",
            "Great phone, small size. The camera is amazing, the screen looks like one of the best especially at this price point. And it is buttery smooth",
            "These phones are not known for the brightness of their screens. The screen on the example I got was exceptionally DULL. Even on 80 percent brightness setting the screen was still duller than all other phones I have recently had at much lower levels of brightness.",
            "Camera is great, phone is rugged well made fast all for a brilliant price",
            "This is my first Pixel and I love it. I was looking for something mid range and this is great value for money. The camera is excellent, the phone runs smoothly and rapidly. All the little details such as the gestures and built in Google software are smart.",
            "Great value for money. Upgraded from Google pixel 2 and worth the upgrade. Slightly bigger screen.",
            "I got what I asked for. It's a quick, reliable phone which I would recommend to someone. The camera is good, the phone is quick and responsive and no complaints.",
            "so far phone has been perfect .ideal for what i required and has many excellent features. Excellent battery live clear screen easy to view",
            "Had the phone a week. Easy to set up and works well. Camera and battery both good value for money. Only thing I don't like is how you close apps (up from the bottom) and the back/swipe from the right. Sure I'll get used to them and don't regret buying.",
            "Upgraded from the 3a - really like this phone. It's basic but I like the form factor. So far so good.",
            "This is a beautiful, light and super easy to use phone.\n\nPicture quality is excellent. Moved away form a frui based competitor a year ago and have never looked back.",
            "The Google Pixel 4a is an awesome phone & stands up well next to the other big brands but without the huge price tag. It's a lot more reasonably priced but performs really well. My son is very happy with it",
            "Not as high spec as the top of the range phones but for this price it's awesome. As long as you don't demand mobile pay, wireless charging etc it's does most things well.",
            "I wanted to get away from Apple phones as they are so expensive and wanted a straight forward android phone to do and it was an easy transition for me.",
            "Pixel 4a is the best phone I've owned. I'm a pensioner and find it very easy to use. I would have preferred a back button instead of swiping but I have adjusted to this feature. It's a great size to hold comfortably in my hand. Camera takes good pictures. I'm delighted with purchase",
            "I owned a pixel 3XL before this and must say the overall pixel 4a 5g has just a lot of cost cutting incorporated to accommodate the low price and I preferred the older models. Simply satisfactory as it does the job but nothing great about it. Little disappointed. Loved my old NOT PINK pixel 3XL.",
            "Very pleased with new phone recommended by my son in law.",
            "This phone is great. From a new phone I mainly wanted a good camera, and this phone takes really clear, crisp, bright photos.",
            "Got to say the Google Pixel 4a is a excellent phone, extremely easy to use. Quick little phone.",
            "Not had the phone long, has not taken me long to realize I had a great one.It is superb, when it comes to photographs. very handy when your fishing. Or have any pastime you like to keep record of. Iv used it to cast movies to my tv, which it has done both with amazing quality , but also with much much greater ease then any other iv had, and with no annoying constant loses of signal etc. In short it really really is a great little phone, So why not the full five stars. Well its only and it is a small let down, But the volume on the phone, for me, is just not quite right. As I said up front, iv not had this long, and I'm no technical expert. maybe a change of head phones or the like, might get it the five stars later. But what your getting now is an honest review from an average guy. Who would gladly tell any of my friends, hay get one of these. in fact, were i to be offered an upgrade or phone change by my supplier. at this point in time id decline. I'm liking this so much.",
            "Recently purchased Google Pixel 4a smartphone, particularly for the highly rated camera. Set-up easy and transfer from existing phone. Phone great to use, user friendly. Camera brilliant as expected.",
            "Great phone, stable, reliable and easy to use. Camera good",
            "I am a great fan of the google pixel 4a, as it is a phone that runs very well so far (since if only had it for around 5 days). The android operating system is easy to use and simple, and the camera is very detailed up to now, even though i havent had the chance to use it much since i dont take a huge amount of photos. Either way, the camera is definetely as good as my previous phone, the google pixel 3, if not better. The screen is oled, and it is visible that it is oled since the colours are vibrant and the black areas on the screen are very dark, making the screen very pleasing to the eye. In conclusion, I really like this phone since it has a great screen, a great camera and overall is really impressive for the pretty low price.",
            "Was hesitant of changing from Samsung to Google, but am so happy that I did. Fantastic phone, easy to use",
            "I’ve previously had several Motorola phones and been happy with them. When I needed a new phone I automatically looked at getting a new one of those.. I then discovered they are all huge and that’s not what I like so looked elsewhere and so many of them are also too big. I searched for a phone the size of my old Moto G5 and came across the Google Pixel 4a and read several good reviews and took a chance on buying one.  Wow, what a revelation. Superior in every way to what I have ever used before, although, to be fair it is more expensive but still not silly money. I am very very happy it’s so good. Thank goodness Motorolas became so big!",
            "Great size, lovely to handle and the position of the biometric sensor is perfect. So many great features to explore and it's really easy to navigate. With a great camera, amazing display and noted for its durability, what's not to love?",
            "If you love Samsung but want something cheaper, this is definitely worth a try. Very similar set up and tools. Really easy to set up and operate. Really pleased with my phone.",
            "Nice fone gave it to my kids. Easy to use and feels nice to hold.",
            "I wanted to replace my 5 year old Samsung galaxy 5 with another similar phone. I liked the look and size of this phone and the camera is superb. Very fast internet.",
            "For me it seems to be easier to navigate. It has a recorder and other easy to access  apps. I no longer have to swipe to answer my phone so that is a plus. I am not a tech   person so am no expert in that department. Glad I got it.",
            "Excellent software support from google, I hope they keep this series of pixle phones going for a long time coming",
            "Should have changed my old phone a long time ago but I'm pleased I waited for this one albeit quite inadvertently. It's got so many features that I don't know how to use but the ones I can and do use are brilliant. So fast and powerful.",
            "As a mobile phone user from the 90s when they became affordable to my first 'smartphone' a htc legend,Nokia Lumia 930 and then a nexus 5x,Google pixel 1,Samsung a70 and my present phone I got recently a Google pixel 4a,my experience over the years has always been focused on value for money and features,namely the camera for me as i am a keen amature photographer I have always found the nexus and Google 1 to be superb and user friendly focused with each new model building on the ethos of the past phones, it is a delight to see the current pixel following on in this theme of providing a phone that does everything the normal person needs and can afford, for sure there are a plethora of other makes and models out there with massive MP sensors but for me the one in the pixel is more than enough and combined with brilliant software and hardware it has knocked me for six in astrophotography images.I recommend this pixel 4a for anyone wanting a phone that will not break the piggy bank.",
            "I started buying Google pixel phones after using IPhones and I was so pleasantly surprised by my experience. I prefer the selfie camera on the iPhones but that's about it. This is the perfect size for everyday use, I generally used to like smaller phones but the PPI and screen size, paired with 5G network make this a really good platform to watch videos on, which I tend to do alot. Despite hearing bad things about the gesture navigation I really like it, and it was easy to get used to. Other features like the \"split screen\" functionality and the great battery life / saver settings really took this phone to another level for me personally. Being a Google phone too I've never had a problem with updates or the OS in general, like I have had with other phones. The back cameras are awesome and although I don't use them as much as I should, if I ever want to capture a moment I can do, and the resulting picture is great quality. This is really good value for money for a camera phone.",
            "Easy upgrade. No problems with transfer. Impressed with the camera and the images it takes and the smooth action in moving from app to app.",
            "The Google Pixel 4a is an excellent phone for the price.",
            "Amazing phone for a great price. I can't believe the quality of the camera and software experience!",
            "Nice smartphone, looks good",
            "The Pixel 4a 5g if an awesome phone, don't hesitate to buy one",
            "Nice phone , bought for its size as it hard finding a smallish phone.  Happy with everything so far.  It a bit different to go back a page but I'm sure it will become the norm soon.  Battery life I had read review which said not great. It's not. Finding if I use it to watch TV etc it barley makes it to afternoon.  That the biggest annoyance.  It's a nice phone  good camera . Also although it has a focus mode unlike my previous phone that blocked sound notifications the focus mode blocks everything till it's either paused or the period ends.   I've not managed to check if my favourites or stared people would still by pass. Working from home for now so it's fine not to have this on.  The voice activation need to start with the press of the assistant button  which seems take away the main benefit . I had an old Moto X  where ok Google would do anything.",
            "Awesome phone .. great display, fast charge, easy set up ... Awesome camera - excellent portrait and editing features ... Finger sensor works perfectly and a headphone jack to top it off. Not to mention the amazing price compared to flag ship phones!",
            "The phone is smaller than other phones, this is a plus though as it is easier to move from pocket to hand and is lighter to hold. Great having assistant answer any question even when locked and in your pocket. Very different to use from my usual Samsung choice, but only after a day or two now and it has become second nature. A great small phone with a huge punch!!! Will now stick with Google phones!",
            "Love the Google Pixel 4A phone , would recommend to anyoneThank you",
            "Going with Googles own phone was a great decision. Not having the awful bloatware that comes with other android manufacturers leaves you with a basic clean phone. \nThe camera is incredible for the phones price. Speakers are great and bass-ey. \nwould highly recommend for anyone not looking to pay for a flagship device",
            "Was really impressed with the pixel 4a. But right from the start, and getting worse all the time, was eye strain. Never had it before with a phone. Pwm apparently. Brilliant otherwise. Oh be warned, you cannot return your phone if you find that you can't use it due to pwm causing eye strain issues. So I lost a few quid n had the hassle of selling it.",
            "This phone is small and lightweight and perfect for one handed use. This was the main reason I changed from the larger android phone I had. The camera is stunning and has recently taken excellent snow shots, sunny shots and selfies. This phone is really good, has a fast processor and no complaints from me whatsoever.",
            "Heavy iOS user and first time on pixel.surprised on how good this phone is. Good purchase",
            "Honestly there is nothing I can hate about this phone. It's officially been a week and I'm loving it.. beautiful camera quality, brilliant screen, amazing sound quality. Bought it with the pixel ear buds, amazing charge on these and the case! Only had to charge them once (last night) used them for at least a few hours everyday and they work brilliantly with the phone",
            "I have been pleasantly surprised by the move having only been an iphone user before.I love the flexibility that you get from Android. There were several features of ios that I really disliked and I don't need to put up with them any more!I like the look (full screen) and feel of the phone - it fits well in my hand. Althogether much happier than I expected!",
            "The picture quality is superb much better than my old phone. The performance is snappy and the display is excellent. 5/5",
            "Very happy with performance and design. Cheers ☺️☺️",
            "I got my Google Pixel 4a 5g last week and it is an exceptional device, fast and with many Hidden features like live captioning. I am a convert.",
            "I'm not a heavy user, don't use streaming/play games. I've been very impressed with this mid price range device. Compactness was my No 1 priority and it's one of a very few phones in this size.",
            "Very pleased with my purchase",
            "Clean UI and very easy to understand. Software updates regular and are guaranteed for three years making security and feature set increasing and improving.",
            "I just love this phone! My first Pixel and it definitely won't be my last. Great camera, great features and can't fault delivery and customer services. Highly recommended.",
            "I used to be a Samsung user, but I'm never going back. This phone is great through and through",
            "I tried many different earbuds in different price ranges and those are the best by far. Great design, sound quality, battery life. Can't think of any downsides.",
            "not worth for the money. I feel I did a mistake by buying this product",
            "I have used Google phones a lot over the years and although another brand phone is fine you always get such a better experience with a Google phone everything just works and the software flows smoothly, one major bonus is the lack of bloatware.The Google camera is something special as well always surprised what a small sensor like this can achieve.The one area I find lacking on Google devices is the customisation options available with other brands but that's pretty minor and in no way a deal breaker.",
            "I had my old phone for ages, and was resistant to getting a new one. But my partner bought himself a Pixel 4a and I was so impressed with it that I got one too! It's fast, intuitive to use, and looks really great. Particularly love the camera, and the speakers sound great for listening to music and podcasts.",
            "Bought this phone to replace my samsung s10 5g. After reading up and hearing more about the Google pixel 4a I decided to push the button... All I can say is what an great little budget phone it is, the camera is a powerhouse which puts most devices to shame, the cpu runs really well with no stutters or crashes and is really smooth while in use plus all the features are really helpful and help navigate around the phone easier. If you're looking for a budget phone that's got everything look no further",
            "I like it a lot it has no glitches and it is really good overall. I love the google assistant as it is really helpful",
            "Surprised at how easy it is to navigate.. only my 2nd android so was nervous of the change.  All the little pixel tips are very useful",
            "I had the 3 for 2.5 years. \nDidn't want to get sucked in to buying a £1000 phone on a daft contract. \n\nThe 4a fits my needs and saves me being tied in. \n\nAwesome",
            "I feel it's a little bit costly because of the brand compare to other products.",
            "The phone itself is just what I wanted, but I may have to return it unless Google can tell me how to get it to work properly with secured wifi networks.  From googling the internet I see that this is a problem affecting many users of this phone.",
            "Amazing little mobile phone  - fast, good battery life, great software experience, fantastic camera. Did I mention the price? I have no hesitation in recommending the Pixel line to everyone I meet!!",
            "Great phone,smooth,good battery and slot of space.",
            "I am enjoying my time with this phone the camera is brill and the android only experience is exactly what I want no gimmicks",
            "Easy to transfer your apps from your old phone, via the lead supplied. Fantastic display, large memory and easy to operate.The battery is absolutely superb, best ever in my opinion. Buy this phone it is much better than a lot of more famous brands which cost a lot more than this value for money gem.",
            "The Google Pixel 4, is okay nothing different really from pixel 3. They're added swipe to go back, which is fine but when the swipe control is close to other documents you end up deleting or removing them. So I've had to put the three buttons, which is also annoying they're so big and unattractive, I had the pixel 3 which you could control with one small line and a small back arrow much better looking if you wanted the phone to look sleeker.Overall the phone works well, camera is as good as a Samsung..but not a lot of changes from pixel 3.",
            "This technophobe has been struggling with a mobile that came out of the ark. Resisted replacing it for a very very long time. This phone was recommended and so far it has been an extremely smart move. Super quick, easy to use and packed with loads of stuff I don't know how to use yet. Wish I'd done it sooner",
            "Brilliant phone, great camera! Very happy with it. Brilliant price too.",
            "What a great value handset.If you're running an Android phone then common sense suggests to have a handset made by the OS designerGreat display, great to use, amazing camera and a great priceLove it....in fact we have 3 X Pixel 4a's in the household because they tick all the boxes",
            "Great phone! Just wish it had wireless charging. Overall I really like it",
            "Moved from apple after a few years now. Was hoping Google will offer me a storage plan with the phone. I already have an iCloud account from my Mac and iPhones in the past .The phone is great and love it. I don't think I will go back to apple phones again.",
            "Really quick and easy to use as well as set up. Great pictures, the speakers sound awesome - through the phone and via the headphone jack.",
            "Great photos charges good great sounds for you tube",
            "Changing up from a 3a I would say Google have no doubt improved upon what was already a great phone.I particularly like the camera with it's Astrophotography feature, beats the iPhone hands down!I have had Google phones for some years now and see no reason to pay the exorbitant prices for Samsung and Apple phones.Keep up the great work Google!",
            "I love this phone. Perfect size and does everything you need a phone to do. Much prefer it to my old phone Samsung S10 5g",
            "Google pixel 4a is a great phone easy to use , amazing camera , great for price.",
            "A perfect smartphone for everyone. Perfect size, nice display, light weight, nice software experience, nice for photography, superb battery life, good speakers.Sound output  through 3.5mm headphone jack could have been better, I will rate 4.5 out of 5 because of this.",
            "Love the Pixel 4a. Compact, lightweight, everything you need in a phone including a headphone jack(which my Pixel 4XL doesn't have).A higher resolution screen,wireless charging and faster refresh rate on the next one please",
            "I had the Google Pixel 3 and was due to upgrade on my phone contract. The Pixel 5 was a bit pricey for me so I opted for the 4a and really regret  it. It feels like a downgrade. The colour on the screen feels really washed out compared to the 3. And I find the touch screen lacks any intuition. Online shopping is clumsy - it clicks into items you're not interested in and when you try to go back, it brings you back to the homepage. There's a delay with the keypad when I type. I'm gutted I'm stuck with this phone now for 36 months on my contract. And even worse, I traded in my Pixel 3 to my service provider. It was 100% a better phone. This was NOT an upgrade.",
            "Nice phone for the money, I love it would by another 1 if anything happens to this one, 5g really fast no messing around., Didn't no weather 2 by it at first but so glad I did...",
            "If I could go back in time I wouldn't select this phone. I read the reviews and ignored the comments about the new set up. Wish I'd listened.I know how to use the phone without the Home, Back, and Tabs buttons at the bottom, however, my phone doesn't agree.No matter how much I swipe, press, fast, slow, plead the gestures only work about 20% of the time on the first go. It's driving me nuts.I ignored the other reviews because I'm great with tech and strongly believe half the difficulty for most people with technology is mind set and a dislike of change. Now I know that in the case it's just a bad system.Gutted",
            "Latest version of Android, guaranteed for the next 3 major versions. Fingerprint scanner works perfectly. Recommended.",
            "Pixel 4a 5g: Everything I wanted in a mid price phone.  I updated from a Pixel 3a, the difference is huge.  Clear screen, user friendly, adaptive and fully functional with a Chromebook.  More volume",
            "A decent phone much like the Pixel 3a it replaced. Slightly annoying new ways to shift between screens and swipe back but I'm getting used to it.",
            "Neat phone with a good screen. A slightly more comprehensive start up manual would be a great help. Battery life isn't great. This isn't helped by the number of apps running in the background which seem impossible to stop or disable. My phone discharges just over 1%ph even when not in use.",
            "the pandemic has caused disruption in normal buying,but click and collect works for me.",
            "Really user friendly, especially those looking to make the switch from Apple to Android.\n Perfect for one-hamd use compared to a lot of other modern phones with large displays.",
            "Great value for money. Easy set up by connecting new phone to my outgoing Samsung, quick and painless transfer of all apps etc. Super display and the size is just right, not too big, but not too small.Very quick to download from the internet. The battery life is the best ever .",
            "Had my Pixel 4a for a week and love it  Compact,  everything runs smoothly and pure android is a revelation after being away from it since the days of owning a Nexus 5x. The camera is awesome.",

            "Had issue with freezing up then restarting . Fixed now not sure how Had issue with SMS toolkit faulting out uninstalled it that seems to have sorted it although the play store wants to update it .Don't like the phone screen why doesn't it come up with dial numbers as soon as you click on the app.Finally I cannot get the facial recognition to work can't find it in settings.As it's a new os for me I currently wouldn't recommend that said I may grow into it",
            "The camera is very good  and cool and I like the live captions",
            "I am really happy with this phone. Still getting used to using it. I keep getting a error message which is annoying . But have found out information on fixing the problem. That is the reason I got a Google phone any issues will be discussed and fixed.",

            "Extremely happy with my purchase and very surprised how easy it was to transfer all my stuff from my old mobile.",
            "This phone just didn't work. I followed the instructions but after completion I could not make a phone call, I could not take a photograph ans the touch screen didn't work. I managed to do a Factory reset after searching the web and tried again. Same result. It seems there is a software problem. I bought this phone because it promised a fast, bloatware free phone with an excellent camera. I was never able to test these parameters.",
            "I only have a basic need for a smartphone and the Pixel 4a fits the bill beautifully.\nThe screen is a joy to watch video's / movies on and the stereo sound is crystal clear and immersive. The camera is just awesome and takes fantastic photo's and the call quality is excellent. Overall I am absolutely delighted with this phone and happy I bought it.",

            "Excellent build quality,  simple to set up from my existing Google account, beautiful screen, good camera plus fast to load apps etc.",
            "I love this phone, I had the last 3 pixels and find them so easy to use, I had to use a spare Huawei phone recently when I drove over my pixel and it was difficult to get used to and crashed daily, new w back on pixel 4a and I'll never want to use any other brands again.",
            "My past phones I found were always way too big in my hands and had a load of random stuff that I didn't need. This little guy is everything I wanted though. Slick, compact and simple.",
            "I always bought phone in this price range (Huawei, Samsung) but this is the first time I am entirely satisfied of the phone, have a great camera/photo quality and overall feel like I bought a higher price phone.\nWill definitely recommend !",
            "Love it, screen size under 6\" which is hard to come by these days and I much prefer the grip it gives me when holding one handed. Response time so quick can't fault it. Upgraded from a Moto g7 so think it'll take a while for the new phone feeling to wear off.",

            "Very impressive battery life. Good camera. Plenty of power for my needs.\nAlso supports Zwift.",

            "The phone itself was very fast with no problems",
            "Had the phone a week now and I am just so impressed. The support from Google is excellent, the phone comes with an on board guide and it is amazing.The things that it can do are brilliant, linking in to smart equipment, Bluetooth, picked my printer up immediately. Google assistant, like the phone is very intuitive.As a disabled person (MS) this phone is the very best I have ever used.Thank you Google",
            "I've only had the phone a few weeks but so far I'm very pleased. Good size- not too big or small, and the picture quality is really good. Touch screen is responsive and the camera is top notch. I have a Google nest and mini so I'm syncing it all up to my phone for easy access to everything.",
            "What a excellent phone every thing works perfect, software is excellent and especially the camera  keep up the good work",

            "Don't know if I'm just unlucky but this phone only lasted for 22hrs and that includes 8hrs sleep, only changed because my 2xl gave up but it was much better than this, don't need headphone jack will probably go to Samsung S20 plus or S21 plus, shame I liked the pixel",
            "Upgraded from Pixel 3, which is now permanently mounted on my 10 inch newtonian as a star finder and astrophotography device.The transfer was easy and the phone is great, nothing hugely better but clearly superior. The standard phone jack is nice as I can charge and listen without using bluetooth.",
            "NFC icon not working even though set up for Google Pay. Dare not use the phone to pay. Never had this problem with my old 1 .",
            "Funky little phone. Easy to use , good camera and very intuitive.",
            "The Pixel is a great device. Very light in the hand with intuitive on-screen controls.  Feels minimal and efficient with apps, settings and gestures. None of the extra pointless stuff you get with brands eg. Samsung or Sony. Seamless move cos I have Gmail, Google Photos, Drive etc already.The camera is great quality - tested on a black cat and bright colours. Overall really impressed, a great value phone. The official fabric cases are very nice too.",
            "Overall great clean software with plenty of trick up it's sleeve but camera is disappointment compared to a Samsung phone. I was led to believe the software on the camera was amazing but it can only compensate so much for the hardware.",
            "Mostly good. Annoying that you have to scroll news items to top to exit from them. Don't want my photos sorted by Google into groups - just in date order please. Great that phone not too big for me to hold. Good camera.",
            "Lovely small phone, feels great in the hand. Does everything I want with a phone plus an amazing camera, which makes any photo you take look half decent without any effort. For the price it's a very incredible phone worth the buy. And because it's a Google phone you get a lot of android updates and fantastic Google features.",
            "Great phone, nice size. Fits perfectly in the hand. Battery life is great can get 2 days of light use on a charge.",
            "It's an amazing phone. Brilliant Camera, fast, good size and good battery life. It's a massive upgrade on my last phone. Now my wife wants one too though!",
            "My last phone was a Google Pixel 3a, so I have upgraded and very pleased that I did. Smaller the my last one and faster.",
            "Simple small pixel 4a is by far the best handset i have owned",
            "Great product that fully integrates with current BMWs",
            "I love my new Google 4a. It is so easy to use and with it being Google will get three years Android updates, which I'm happy about.",
            "Nice clean android smartphone powerful enough for what I need it replaced a Samsung s10e and I haven't felt like I'm missing anything.",
            "This phone has fantastic performance, especially for its price. The camera takes photos out of this world and the software is fantastic. The fingerprint scanner is fast and the screen is great too, battery life is okay, I get a day out of it easily, but my previous phone used to last 1.5 days. I love the smaller form and the light weight of it too, much more ergonomic.",
            "Just wish it was a bigger screen like on the Samsung note.",
            "This phone is well built, fast and slick. I am not really interested in what processor it might have, or its refresh rate, and I don't watch movies or play games on it, I just want a reliable phone. Comes with a fast charge plug  and cable, and yes, it is fast!!!It does all the major things well, i.e. call quality, messaging both text and video, and apps like Facebook and YouTube work well. It is updated before most other phones and it doesn't come pre-loaded with unwanted apps which is a bonus too.I drop a star on one thing only and that is for the sound, not the quality but the volume! It seems very quiet to me (though at 68 perhaps I am getting deaf).Overall, I would recommend a Pixel 4a",
            "Very good phone, have no issues to talk of, could do with more pre installed ring and notification sounds",
            "With out doubt the best phone I've owned. Perfect size for one handed operation. Camera excellent. Fluid operation great screen. Al in all a great phone.",
            "I am frilled to bits with this phone! I like the fact you're getting a phone that's worth double the cost. Pictures are amazing and look more natural and because it's a Google phone you can select \"high quality\" rather than \"original quality\" option to store unlimited photos at a compressed size, yet the quality looks exactly the same. Some review I saw showed that you would have to zoom in 500x to see the difference, this is because of the clever way google compresses the data. Love it!",
            "I've moved from a 5 year old phone to this phone. So when reading this please remember that my old phone is my only comparison and therefore this phone seems amazing! I've now had it for a week and love it. The main plus of this phone is the camera, which is amazing! The battery life lasts about a day and a half, which is surprising as I expected to have to charge it every night. The size is a nice size, maybe slightly larger than I'd like personally. I can't really complain at all, but my minor complaint is the ordering of apps, if you could order by most used that would be helpful. On the whole we have decided that it's a great phone and that we will get another for my wife.",
            "This phone does everything I need. I came from a Galaxy S8. I love the fact that it's pure Android and has a hefty amount of internal storage. The only thing I do miss is a notification light but that's a minor detail.",
            "Love my new pixel. The only thing that annoys me is the screenshot feature. Having to press the buttons on the side is really annoying! My old Huawei was so much easier by touching the screen. Getting used to not having a back arrow is a bit strange. But I'm getting there....",
            "On paper, this phone (and all the Pixel phones) seem like a great idea, unfortunately, they rarely ever go according to plan, I previously had a Pixel 3, which had to be replaced due to it being faulty, the replacement device also needed to be replaced as it was faulty, they replaced it with a Pixel 4a, which is arguably neither better or worse than the Pixel 3. The fingerprint sensor has always been an issue on Pixel devices, with all 3 of my Pixel phones having pretty bad fingerprint sensors, barely able to recognise my fingerprint if there is even the slightest bit of moisture or debris, something that any other phone doesn't struggle with at all. In terms of performance, the Pixel phones are great, they're speedy, responsive and they really do feel premium, the same with the camera (Although the Pixel 3 camera is far better than the 4a, somehow).Overall, I wouldn't recommend the Pixel line of phones, they promise a lot, but a lot of those promises fall short.",
            "At a mid range price gives very good value. Good performance as a voice phone. Pretty smooth and high quality display performance for the price point. Very nice size which makes one hand operation easy. Finger recognition works well and is very convenient. Excellent software/operating system. Excellent still photos. Pretty good videos which can be shaky but acceptable for most purposes. Overall I am very happy with the Pixel 4a which, though not a \"flagship\" type phone, is especially good for the price.",
            "I  acquired the Pixel 4a to replace my Pixel 3a after I'd accidentally damaged it.  I found it to be entirely satisfactory and straightforward, and as quick as I need a phone to be.  Only a couple of weeks experience with it and nothing unusual to report, but the battery life is much better than its predecessor.",
            "I always gravitated towards Google-made phones. I did own a couple of other brands (and even an iPhone), but now that I got back to Android and bought this Pixel 4A I am really not looking back.It's quite light for the size and it's lightning fast. I find it looks really good and I love the camera. It does way more than I need it to do to be fair, and Android 11 on it is just fantastic. I really like the gestures and not having to deal with buttons, I got used to the gestures really quick.It feels very premium, definitely recommended.",
            "Great device, simple but classy design, amazing camera. It's my first 5g smartphone and wow, getting up to 600Mbps download speed in my area. I'm super happy with the Pixel",
            "Interface is not easy / familiar to use.....Though the phone itself is good it's the no back button that causes problems, swiping from right edge to the left is too close to the delete function. Grrrrr",
            "Great phone and amazing photos. The software is easy to use.",
            "I love my pixel phones I've had one of each and so far this is the best I've had. It's easy to use without been too easy, the camera is awesome and the new gesture controls rather than the buttons at the bottom is great now I've got used to them lol xx however I just wanted something more something extra it's too similar to the 3. I wanted to be wowed. Another downside is the lack of earphones. Cheap move Google.",
            "Having owned Samsungs for all of my previous smartphone life, I was a little wary of moving to a different manufacturer, but this phone is fantastic. Smart, solidly build, feels good in the hand, unbloated OS, fantastic camera, superb stereo sound (pretty loud!), and whilst it takes some getting used to Android 11 is well worth it. Happy I made the switch to Google's own brand.",
            "Went to Apple after upgrading to the Pixel 4XL (which I hated) from the pixel 3a (which I loved). Gone back to the pixel 4a 5G and very glad I did. Love this phone.",
            "Does what it says on the box. Lasts 2 days without recharge and does everything and more than I need. It's more than fast enough even on 4g downloads with a decent screen for my usage. I particularly like the dedicated security features. Which means my info remains secure, and with a clean operating system updated regularly and future proof for years to come, with the option of 5g rollout, all at a good value for money price. However for me the deciding factor was wired headphone option in a good quality phone.  What's not to like.",
            "I love mi pixel 4a the camera is amazing, it's responsive. The display is clear and the speakers are loud. The Google case is also great.Well done google for such a fantastic product.",
            "Works great; clean Android experience; stereo speakers work well; design is good (though wouldn't mind more premium materials); overall a very good phone in this price range",
            "I can't get used to it at all, it doesn't have the buttons at the bottom of the screen to go back and you have to swipe which doesn't always work.\n\nThe only good thing is it charges really quick.\n\nWouldn't recommend at all.",
            "Currently at this price point, it's possibly the best value Android phone out there. It's fast enough, really good battery life between charges, exceptional camera, & Android updates on the 5th of every month. Comfortable unobtrusive size, excellent screen, no bloat-ware pre-loaded. A quality charger & cable is included. It simply does everything so well, at this price point difficult to find anything negative. Click & collect was safe, faultless & fast.",
            "My new phone is a very sleek and awe-inspiring device. I am excited to discover all its features and am extremely happy with it!",
            "I wanted a smallish phone for my pocket with upto date tech, a good canera and a reasonable price.  That narrowed the search to the OnePlus Nord and the 4a.  Now I am not a power user so the Nord's superior specs were not especially attractive due to its larger size and higher price.  In addition reviews said that in practice the 4a picture quality was at least as good as the Nords. Thee 4a was thus  a compromise but one that best fitted my needs.In use, its size is perfect for me, nicely slipping in its case into my back pocket.  It is smaller than my previous OnePlus 3T and this I like. It is faster than that phone and it's camera is I think superior with rich and detailed images.In my usage battery life is fine, I am rarely down to 40% by the end of the day, but remember I use the phone for browsing, messaging and not watching video or gaming.So, a great product for me so far with no regrets on purchase.",
            "I got this phone to take advantage of wi-fi calling from my new provider. It's actually a lower spec than my previous phone, a flagship from a couple of years ago, and I was a bit worried I'd notice the difference but I needn't have been concerned. The phone is really nice to use. Everything just works! A decent screen, great finger print sensor, good quality sound from the 3.5mm headphone jack (thank you for retaining that, Google. I don't want to carry more dongles around!). The camera is a standout feature - particularly the portrait mode. Also note I think of it, the battery life is surprisingly good. I easily get a full day and a half out of a charge.Finally I really like the feel of the phone. It reminds me of my old Nexus 5. It's plastic but has a very nice grippy feel to it. Very pleased and for the price it's a no brainer.",
            "This little phone is perfect for those looking for a great camera at an affordable price. You can't beat savings. First ever Pixel and WILL get again!",
            "No issues, it's a good and decent phone so time to get one",
            "Seems all good. Replacing a battered pixel 2 XL wanted 5G but not to be hit with apple tax. Decent mid range, no 5g in my area yet. Sadface",
            "Great little phone, smooth and quick running times 100 percent recommended",
            "For a budget phone the pixel 4a has very decent specs. Device comes shipped with android 11 out of the box which is stock android. The camera takes great, crisp and sharp photos. The phone itself feels nice in the hand, although not premium, but i can understand seeing its in the budget price range. Unfortunately i had to return the phone due to the poor battery life. I've gone for oneplus nord which comes in nearly at the same price, but feels more premium and packs a far better knockout punch in terms of specs.",
            "This phone is really good! My last phone was rubbish and never got updates. This one gets regular updates which is important.",
            "Great phone to use, fast and very responsive,\nGood bulild quality easy to set up and use.",
            "This was bought to replace an iPhone SE original. I'm along time Apple user but with the latest offerings from Apple being extortionately expensive, I turn to the Google pixel 4a! So what can I say, the camera on this phone is great and the battery life is amazing and far outstrips any apple battery. This phone is a perfect size and a happy medium between a good size screen and not being so big you need a hand bag to carry it around - something that was important to me.",
            "It is surely a great phone. But somehow I ended up with another phone through the ordering process. But it’s probably me who made the mistake",
            "Ordered phone online and it was available at my local store immediately. Excellent Covid procedures at store and phone was handed over brand new in a sealed box. Would highly recommend this phone as it’s easy to use and has all the features of the best iPhones at half the cost. Would also order again from Argos as whole process from online order to phone delivery was excellent and in full accordance with Covid procedures.",
            "This phone is perfect for me, great price and a nice size (not to big), in the past I have always gone for a larger phone but due to age and arthritis I went for this phone, pain has no gone in my hand! Also with Google phones they are always up to date and secure. Brilliant bit of kit.",
            "The phone is quite light in it's design with black plastic. It feels quite good in the hand, and is not like previous phones I have had. \nThe software, at this point is android 11 and it seems pretty quick within the refresh rate. The google assistant is quite good in now it can change certain settings if you ask it too. Also from 2020 - 2023, it has android updates queued, and the Pixel will get them before  any other android device.",
            "I ordered it as my previous phone broke down and I could not be happier. Best price/quality in the market",
            "Easily lives up to its tremendous reputation for communications, photography and app versatility. A competent competitor against much more expensive alternatives. I bought it to replace my faulty five-year old Samsung Galaxy Prime, and for Android 11 (and upwards) and for using with Amazon and WhatsApp. USB3 is impressive. The Pixel 4a is quite a step forward! I think it will be good for some years. Argos delivery and insurance are both highly acceptable. Buy one!",
            "Bought to replace my ageing android phone, I am very pleased with this model.  The instructions supplied on the phone made  it easy to set up and transfer the data from old phone.",
            "Phone speaker failed after a month of use. Still trying to get a replacement handset from Argos.",
            "plug in your old phone as per instructions and away you go, sim card slots in easy with the little tool provided, don't loose it! You van connect to your pc but need to buy a USB to C data cable.",
            "Couldn't ask for q better phone for the price",
            "Been really pleased so far, I particularly liked this model as it was not to big, fits in hand and pocket nice , fantastic battery life and charges up real quick .does all what I want and more , it's a very quick , powerful phone , very responsive, can handle any task. Battery life is the biggest problem on a phone I find but with this one , you can just forget about that while using it for average stuff anyway.",
            "I bought this phone as it has the best camera available in this price bracket. I haven't been disappointed. Amazing pictures and a brilliant smartphone all around.",
            "Quality phone, fits in you're hand for one hand use perfectly. Screen Quality is brilliant. Battery life genuinely depends on how long you are looking at a screen for as always.",
            "The price is very good for the price. It has a high quality camera - especially in night shots.",
            "Simple to use and the possibility to link everything from your phone to your pc is the best thing for me. The camera pictures are amazing. If you are looking for just a phone with a great camera without all the fancy tech provide from Samsung and Apple. Let face it many people wont ever will use the whole power of those devices in fact they will use just facebook, tictoc or whatsapp",
            "After having an iPhone for over ten years I decided not to have one for my new phone. Delighted with the Pixel 4a. Easy to use and set up, and I do not feel I have lost anything in terms of usability.",
            "Very sharp camera\nVery bright colours \nEven in low brightened room the photos are lovely",
            "Took a lot of setting up as there is no manual.  The only information is on the phone.  Once set up it is easy to use and looks good.",
            "Very good, affordable smart phone \nExcellent camera",
            "I bought the Pixel 4a off the strength of its reviews for being a no-frills Android phone with a camera that rivals the top spec devices out there. Unfortunately, after switching the phone on I had numerous issues:\n- Files not saving to the device.\n- Camera App not taking/saving photos\n\nI tried resetting this phone 3 times but after each, the above issues would reappear. I don't know if this is a Pixel 4a, Android 11, or a hardware issue, but the phone was not fit for purpose so returned.",
            "Typical pixel goodness (latest version of Android and security patches, simple and clean UI, takes great photos, has a headphone jack(!!!!!) and USB c. Has NFC, fingerprint reader, great screen and haptic feedback. What it doesn't have...no wireless charging, no glass back. \nIt's a compact, well made and robust phone.\nFor my tastes it represents excellent value for money.",
            "I needed to replace an ageing Samsung mobile, and after some research decided to go for the Google Pixel 4A. I have not regretted that choice, as the phone is everything I hoped it would be. Battery life is amazing, up to three days without charging (I am not a social media addict !).\nThe OS is a little different to Samsung's version of android, but you soon get used to that.\nIf you choose this phone you will not regret it.",
            "I paid in the 6 hundreds for my Pixel 2 and in the 3 hundreds for this 4a. Broadly a very similar phone. Couldn't get on with gestures for UI navigation, which is the default but thankfully that was easy to change. Very slow to rotate the screen from landscape to portrait or vice versa, but not a show-stopper. Good phone would recommend,",
            "The best price I could anywhere, instant availability to collect in-store. An excellent mobile with outstanding camera and incredible capacity. A real bargain.",
            "Top quality phone, covid safety In place in store was good and service speedy. Good job Argos",
            "Solid phone - Everything you need. Easy to navigate around and is a good size in hand.",
            "My new Google Pixel 4a is good value but I am not sure that it is much different in use to my old Pixel 2. I bought it not to upgrade so much as because the display failed entirely on the Pixel 2.",
            "Hardware can run all that is thrown at it...as for games ...it my be a little difficult do to the small screen size...aldow the phone will run on full graphic and everything any game.\nAs for the pixel experience ...it's great, simple and efficient. \nGood phone all around , even the battery life is great...Google pay works great and all sorts of other services from Google.\nDefenetly worth considering having a pixel phone.",
            "Love it!\ncan't find better for the price. I wish it had a better battery but I'm a heavy user and I had this problem with every phone. On the bright side, it charges fast.",
            "Looking for a 'compact' mobile phone.  This one was a little longer than our previous Sony compact phones but is fine as a compact.  As usual took a long time to set up as our old phones but it did offer the option of transferring the apps and settings from my Sony phone and this worked to a point - it missed some apps and some folders so you do need to check.  Not heavy user but the battery life is good for our use.",
            "This phone is genuinely great - it comes at a great price point for what it's capable of. It's easy to see where the pennies were saved mind you, for example the phone is plastic bodied, does not charge wirelessly and isn't 5g compatible. However it blows me away in every other aspect. I can play recently released games with good graphics and frame rate. The UI is swift and responsive, the camera is great and I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. All in all, I'd recommend the pixel 4a",
            "I purchased this phone to replace my Lenovo one (years old & outlived its shelf life.) Google 3a had been recommended to me by users & I'd seen proof of the photos (amazing), but as there was a 4a with greater storage capacity at a good price, I chose that model. It is fantastic! The functions are great, the battery life excellent for me (I rarely do YouTube or such like but do have a Fitbit connected,) the photos & videos truly awesome. The phone really is fantastic & I highly recommend it.",
            "Size is just right for your pocket\nYou need to go through the phone to ensure you set it up to suit you.",
            "Reasonable price for a good phone, ..I find it quick when browsing but the reason I bought this was for the camera and it doesn't disappoint , unlike previous android phones , would recommend ....:)",
            "Not the best, work ok for me",
            "I wouldn’t recommend it as it's volume is very low despite setting it on highest volume.",
            "Not a bad phone. \nNo bloat ware.",
            "Good phone overall, no complaints",
            "Absolutely no one mentions that the phone overheats while in use!!\nThank you but I also returned it !!!",
            "Brill colour, sits well in my hand. So compatible to use, easily accessible.",
            "This phone has a sleek and eye-catching aesthetic. The phone has a lightweight and compact feel to it. The camera is capable of producing images of exceptional quality, and the latest android version it supports feels seamless and responsive. Good design and a user friendly interface makes this phone a good choice for almost everyone.",
            "I had a samsung phone before, but it kept dropping wi-fi and had to be re-set a lot. the pixel\nphone does not have any faults, everything works really well. I am very happy with this purchase.",
            "I bought it for a Xmas present for my husband, he hasn't put it down since. He is very pleased with it, would definitely recommend it.",
            "Great phone very good battery life.\nFits in pockets when out and about.\nCamera excellent. Don't wait go and buy one you will be very pleased with it.",
            "Flagship camera, Clean android, fast and flawless",
            "A phone that works as well as the high range market phones but at an affordable price. Does everything it needs too.",
            "I would say for the price, an excellent phone, however the front facing camera isn't great. Except that, good purchase",
            "Lovely phone and user experience, very happy!",
            "super .Excellent camera",
            "Bought Black Friday weekend. Incoming phone calls received with lock screen on (phone not in use) could be answered but if phone was in use the calls could not be answered - notification bar unresponsive. A software updatedid not resolve the fault and it got worse - I could not be heard if I made a call. Returned the phone for a full refund - not impressed but Argos brilliant as always.",
            "So much more storage than my previous phone so loads more apps, photos and music for me!\nDownloads are fast, switching over from my last phone was really easy. \nAlso love having a headphone jack - lots of newer phones don't for some reason.",
            "This phone is great and really easy to use. I love how simple it is and how its not overly complicated. The back of the phone is plastic build, but it looks expensive and feels great. The camera is the stand out feature with this phone as the pictures come out crisp, even in low lightening. The phone also has a nice colour power button which adds to the phone. The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly. Another feature I love is the fingerprint scanner. I'm very happy with this phone.",
            "It has impressed/surprised me, i've never used a Google phone before but the camera is amazing & better than any phones i've had before.\nCONS:\nA bit basic as it lacks a few fancy apps & features.\nDoesn't have sd card slot.\nDoesn't come with headphones.\nPROS:\nLight & stylish.\nVery good finger print scanner on the back.\nGreat google assistant.\nThe camera is amazing.\nNight sight is brilliant.\nHas a leveler to get straight photos.\nGoogle translate in camera mode for live translation.",
            "Easy to use and set up,not to big and heavy, battery life is really good, in built AI guides you through to get the most out of your phone and make it your own personal taste, would definitely recommend to a friend.",
            "Decided to go the whole hog with Google and get one of their phones. Has Android version 11 installed. Good camera. Battery doesn't last as long as my old phone, though it charges quickly and tells you when it will run out. Finger pad works well. Good phone for the price.  As G5 is not getting to Oxford anytime soon, not worried that it doesn't have it.",
            "I am quite impressed by this phone. The style is amazing, with smooth lines and an expensive feel. It seems as sturdy enough, but you don't want to drop it to test. I have an iphone 6s and it is a little bigger, but there isn't much in it. It was really easy to set up as I already had a Google account. It is smooth and easy to use despite having to relearn how after using an iphone. The camera is impressive, with a clear picture and night mode. Comes complete with USB-C cable, plug and adapter.",
            "A big step up from my 4 year old iOS phone. Comes with charger, sim tray pin and a gadget to move everything from your old phone. My Fitbit took a while to sync but got there eventually, everything else is super fast! No headphones included. Camera is phenomenal and portrait mode(slightly blurs background)is my favourite feature.Battery lasts me a day which includes gaming and videos.\nThere will be lots more for me to discover being new to Android but overall I’m very pleased with this phone.",
            "A friend of mine had also order this 4a model a week after I did as he loved the phone user interface n best thing ...u order it now n pick it up immediately from Argos near by or tomorrow or day after at your convenience. Would be great if argos can offer some small freebies to regular buyers apart from seasonal discount. Thanks.",
            "Great phone for price my previous phone was 4x the cost & this one does all & slightly more also the camera is great! Google should advertise it as a camera with a phone it's that good.",
            "Having left Apple in the summer I chose the Pixel after being let down by Huawei. The clutter-free install of Android, clean design, great performance, agile camera and decent battery all have left me very happy indeed. Top service from Argos, too.",
            "Really great phone. One of the best on the market in term of value. Battery life is excellent, photos are awesome. Really quick phone",
            "The size of this phone was one of its selling points alongside its specifications and performance reviews. Whilst the battery life may be pushed for someone who is a heavy gamer / video user, for most people I would suggest that it is adequate, I get at least two days. It is simple to set up. It is nice that the home screen can be simplified, e.g. if you use more than one browser, you can group them together in a single group icon rather than having multiple app icons.",
            "Awesome product and was price reduced \nMy argos app let me know about price so I strongly suggest you download it",
            "Took some time to get used to new Android version, but after that it's easy to use, good battery life, great camera.",
            "Fantastic device from Google with the latest Android operating system and full security updates for three years. Battery life is extremely good and easily lasts a full day's use. Always feels quick and snappy and never feels sluggish. Huge amount of storage for photos, videos, music and media. Highly recommended.",
            "It's fast, I can pay with my phone, the latest android is really good. I play the radio through my phone all the time and previous android it was hard to switch to a different speaker. Now that can be changed so quickly in the notification. Many other improvements, especially gestures, once you get used to it, but it can be turned off to get the old buttons back at the bottom of the screen. Photos are also really good, especially the low light option. Bad: battery life, no macro lens. Loving it!",
            "What a brilliant phone, I would recommend it to everyone. I used to have an I-Phone but this is far better. Go and get one now, it won’t dissaoint.",
            "Feels nice and quick, would recommend",
            "Love the style, size, weight. My previous phone was a Samsung S7, I loved that phone but the battery life was not that great. With the google pixel 4a I still have 35-50% left at the end of the day. The transition from my old phone to this one was seamless with a charging cable and the adapter provided and it only took a few minutes. Everything was copied over to my new phone.all apps, settings, phone members, email accounts, screen wallpapers, etc. Great camera too",
            "I received this newly released Google Pixel 4a a week ago and I absolutely love my new phone! This product is jam packed with incredible features. The camera is high quality and works like a pro whether it’s up close or from far. The security is fantastic, Google will always make sure to send you emails/ updates of your recent activities or places you’ve visited. The battery life is long lasting and Google assistant is amazing when on the go. This phone is affordable, phenomenal and a must have",
            "Upgrading from an ancient phone - this provides me with power and memory to do everything I want a phone to do without too many features that i wouldn't use. Battery life is good so far and it is easy to use.",
            "Phone is working great, smooth transition from 3a",
            "Definitely would recommend google pixel phones as a great phone also thank Argos for the quick delivery and amazing service! Thank you",
            "I've owned the Google pixel 3axl previously and I don't think I'd ever go back to Samsung or any other brand of phone..this phone does it all for me! Asking camera even with a singular lens still absolutely amazing! So happy with my Google product!",
            "Great and fast service. Will surely use it again and recommend to others",
            "I just bought it recently, but it looks like really good phone!",
            "Fantastic phone that delivers great battery life and good photos throughout the day AND night. Really impressive night vision shots. \n\nWhat you get in features is slightly let down by the fact that the screen scratches very easily. Not a problem with a good screen guard but you'll need one from the start. \n\nOther than that, a faultless purchase for the price.",
            "Quicker than the iPhone 7 it replaced and a much better battery life and screen.\nRecommended.",
            "Loved the google phone",
            "Decent performance and features for the price. For the price, does the job nicely.\nBattery life is good - can get two days of light usage out of it, and could potentially stretch to three if I used it less! \n\nStill has a 3.5mm headphone jack if that's your cup of tea and you need that.\n\nCamera is excellent for the price and gives my partners iPhone SE 2020 a run for it's money.\n\nOverall, very worthwhile purchase.",
            "Great phone for the price... Nice screen (small compared to some currently) but perfect for one handed use and still plenty big enough to type on and watch YouTube etc.\nBattery life great plus fast charge.\nSoftware best you can get being pure Android with guaranteed updates which makes the phone fast if not over powerful with the chipset, but perfect for daily tasks.\nI would highly recommend.",
            "I'm loving my new phone. It's fast, very responsive, has quite a bit of memory. The battery could last a bit longer, but I really can't complain given how much I use it!",
            "Really good phone with latest android software plus the camera is great.",
            "I have been an Apple user for 10 years but started to get annoyed with the phones letting me down so many times. Plus the prices were too much. So i decided to make the move to android and i am so glad i did. I haven't struggled with the switch over at all which was my main concern but i get along with it amazingly and i wouldn't say i am the most tech savvy. The only thing that bugs me is the spell check isn't great. Other than that for the price its great, design, camera, features, clarity",
            "bargain phone for the price, size just right, screen sharp and vivid, camera photos are great\nwould liked to have seen a 3x2 ratio, but not a major problem",
            "The low price doesn't translate to a watered down product at all. Great phone with class leading camera. Can't go wrong with this one.",
            "Plenty of bang for your buck! Very happy with the features and performance and a reasonable price tag!",
            "* Great quality camera with lots of different modes and helpers.\n* Battery lasts all day, even with lots of youtube, etc.\n* Compact screen size. Perfect for one-handed use and fits easily in a front pocket.\n* Clean Android 11 OS and updates for at least 3 years.\nI was confused when the Argos product description said it came on Lycamobile network, despite it being sim free. This is just a mistake, it is not tethered to any network.",
            "I upgraded from the Pixel 2 and have noticed significant improvements in this device. I'm most stunned by the battery life which can last over a whole day with pretty decent usage.",
            "No instruction book/pdf so a major drawback\nSince you haven't got a book, you can think you have taken photos in Portrait mode when you haven't\nCommunication via the USB is easy once you have a cable- this should be given with the phone. You shouldn't have to work out from your mistakes that it doesn't transfer to a USB stick. No doubt I will be told that it does, but not for me.\nGood camera\nGood battery life",
            "My son loves this phone - he used to have an iPhone but made the switch, he’s glad he did. Battery, camera are amazing he said, he’s still navigating his way around it but he’s v pleased.",
            "....not a good buy. Apart from the camera, nothing worked. After Google help proved hopeless, I spent a long time with my network tech department. They finally told me I had a broken device and must return it. After all the anticipation, my ideal phone let me down. The only good news was that Argos, in the shape of a very clever assistant, were able to recover all my data and return the dud phone to its useless factory settings and my money to my bank! Well done Argos!",
            "Perfect size for one handed use. It's refreshing how small it feels to hold. Great screen and camera. Don't need much more performance out of the SOC.",
            "Reminds me of phones of a few years ago, simple and does everything well, solid.\n\nPros: Amazing camera, fantastic looking screen, solid sound, android 11 and solid battery life.\n\nI bought it for the camera set-up and I'm not disappointed for the price to run alongside my everyday honor phone.\n\nFive stars",
            "At a time when you could be excused to believe that a good phone costs north of one thousand pounds, Google Pixel 4a is an absolute gem. I did lots of research prior to upgrading my old Samsung S6 and I'm very happy. This phone is a pleasure to use. Camera is as good as I've been led to believe. Battery life is better than I expected. I don't remember the last time I didn't have to charge my phone every night - but I'm fairly sure it was before my first touch-screen device. It's a no brainer.",
            "The best phone what I ever had. Camera is perfect",
            "Must be the best mobile for the price. Just amazing in everything.",
            "Very easy to use and set up. Takes brilliant  photos, and the sound quality is crisp and clear.",
            "Absolute best pixel to date for the price ! And hardware , software experience is no different than my Pixel 4XL which was double the price ! One thing I love is the size of this phone, in a day full of monster sized phones this Pixel is perfection in the hand ! Im going to be using this as my main camera when travelling starts again next year ! Last thing I'd say is I can't believe how long the battery lasts ! My 4XL struggled to get me through a full heavy day but with this no issues !",
            "Not many smaller size androids on the market. Although it is small it manages not to leave you yearning for a larger screen, like the Pixel 2 did. \nWas using faster phones but wanted something that fits in pocket easy, takes good pics, has headphone jack (and it runs some good over ear headphones fine). \nThe processor is a step down from what I've been using but isn't a disappointment and I've noticed no lags even leaving loads of apps open. \nBattery life is also good.",
            "Overall I am really happy of my purchase small budget phone..plus great battery life,the latest Android and from a lots of YouTubers reviews great camera!I can't see much difference between photos from this phone and previous version as my friends have pixel 2xl ,3a etc maybe night mode is better.I wanted to try Google phone from long time and have clear Android experience but I can't say that was worth the wait(as this delay because of covid19 was too long )."
