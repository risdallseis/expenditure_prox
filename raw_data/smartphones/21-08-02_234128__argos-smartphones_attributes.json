            "I was a bit little hesitant about paying out for a new phone but I’m so glad I did, by far my favourite phone I’ve ever had",
            "I brought this and Absolutely love it has I do everything on it",
            "I’ve used other android phones in the past and they don’t compare to a iPhone for reliability, also the iCloud is a fantastic feature for backing up all your contacts and photos.\nIn my opinion Apple iPhone as no rival.",
            "This is my first Apple iPhone having changed from an android.   Very nice to use, many great features and a very good camera.  Synced with my iPad making it very easy to organise all my photographs.",
            "I buy this phone for my daughter and she loves",
            "I always have apple phones and once again I’m delighted with my new phone. Good features and nice aesthetic all round. Getting free Apple TV was a nice bonus, easy to use, great camera and sounds",
            "Pleased I bought this phone",
            "My dad bought me this phone as a present and I just love it. Everyone at school is so jealous of it. Shame I dropped it on day one and smashed the screen but I didn’t have a cover for it then",
            "I bought this a month ago and I found it very easy to use. It has great features and is has the best value for your money when it comes to the newer iPhones",
            "It’s perfectly functional. The only thing that bugged me is that it has words “Product red” engraved at the back of the phone. I don’t understand for what reason it’s there, it certainly doesn’t make the phone more attractive.",
            "I bought this iPhone month a go happy I have replaced the phone I had",
            "love it got everything that I needed",
            "I bought this about a month ago and so far I'm happy with my choice",

            "I am happy that I bought",
            "Really love the phone, the camera is really great, I especially like the portrait mode which makes the subject stand out by blurring the background. \nBattery life is really good and lasts me around 2 days of moderate usage.\nScreen size is perfect and a huge improvement over my old iPhone 6S.\nAs usual the service from Argos was excellent.",

            "Very happy with purchasing the item money will spent",
            "Broke my last phone and needed a quick replacement.  Bought this 30mins before store closed online and collected immediately. Had my data etc transferred over an hour later.  I always buy a model that has been out for a while but is still supported by updates - far better value and unless you want to make movies using your phone does most everything more recent models do.",
            "Great phone, great price for what you’re getting, incredibly supportive staff. App and website weren’t functioning and I couldn’t place an order online. Went into store and they fixed my issue, and allowed me to buy the phone in store instead. Would definitely recommend.",

            "Excellent service from Argos, delivered as expected with tracking available even down to being advised they were three minutes away. Phone is brilliant, just what I needed. No complaints whatsoever.",
            "I used to have an iPhone 7 which lost its battery really quickly, now with this phone I only have to charge it once and it lasts up to 3 days! Definitely worth the money",
            "Really happy with it the cameras great compared to the iPhone 6 I had before this. Easy to use battery life is great. Only downside is the charger cable it comes with dosent fit the older models phone plug but apart from that no problems",

I would recommend that you purchase a screen protector and a cover for the back of the phone.  I purchased a clear plastic one so I can still see it is a red phone.  The fact that you just have to pick up the phone and it is activated is a neat trick.  The torch is an excellent toy as well.",

            "Great phone so easy to use",
            "I upgraded from an iPhone 7 to an 11 and that was one of my best decisions as this phone is fast and the camera quality is a 10/10 and the battery life lasts long however the only bad thing to say is that the price is quite expensive however worth it and the new iPhones should have AirPods as the phones are expensive but all in honestly I love my new phone",
            "The phone was for my son and he loves it. The battery lasts long, the design is perfect, the features and the camera are excellent as well. Now I don’t need to buy a camera separately for his photos. The product is great. Thank you! :)",

            "This is my first Iphone I’m really pleased with it, I especially like the ‘Raise To Wake’ and the face id works flawlessly everytime no putting your finger on the button for ID or tapping in a pin code, you won’t be disappointed if you buy this phone, I have it on dark mode and the battery lasts three days I am not a young person I might add so it probably won’t last that long if you are.

            "I’ve not owned an iPhone since they broke the £1000 barrier. As the “budget” option I was concerned the compromise would be too much. But quite the opposite.\n\nThe screen is great in person (despite how it looks on a spec sheet) the battery life is better than my last phone which had a much larger battery and Face ID just works.\n\nNo complaints.",

            "I was an Android user but my car only had Car Play interface so decided to swap to an iPhone. First thought was\"it's costly\" but soon happy with purchase.\nPlus points - speed, stability, camera + even \"dare I say it\" the overall iPhone experience coming from a 65+ year old guy who has never used an Apple product before.\nMinus points - price compared to Android equivalent + price of Apple accessories.\nThanks finally to Argos for helping me to get a nice red 11 model the same week it came out.",

            "iPhone11 is good. The camera and the various features within camera app are great. Moving from a 6S, it feels a bit heavier and getting used to gestures instead of button functions is taking time. Only lighting port headphones will work so all spare ones are of no use.",
            "Great phone - camera especially is excellent quality and I like the new functions. \nBattery life - lasts all day (that is with frequent use). I can get two days out the battery with light use. I was sure to follow instructions on first time charging (just under 3hrs to fully charge mine straight out the box). \nEasy to set up. Purple is lovely colour. \nThe only reason for 4/5 stars is purely price. At the end of the day, it is just a phone. Apple certainly like to command high prices...",

            "Excellent upgrade, the best iPhone for a while, the camera is excellent and has the majority of the features of the pro. I also own a pro and unless you’re someone who needs to have the latest and greatest then this is the way to go. The battery is great, especially for an lcd display and the build quality is fantastic. Though I do case and screen protect my phones as soon as I buy them. Recommended",

            "So happy I moved from my iPhone 7 to the iPhone 11. Battery life really is all day. The camera is amazing and 1080p video is just like 4k quality. The phone is slightly heavier due to the bigger life battery but at least you know your phone is in your pocket. One word of caution is buy a screen protector straight away as the phone screen is very easy to mark. WiFi is even faster than all my previous phones. Camera quality in darkness is brilliant.",
            "It is a fast phone with amazing battery life but is slow to charge.",

            "This is an amazing phone, all the usual features as you would expect from apple, face id is a good addition though, phone opens instantly without having to touch it and app open fast.

Been buying electronics from there for a few years now. Definitely recommend both product and retailer.",

            "I got this for my son birthday and he loved it.",
            "Really pleased with the iPhone11. The build quality and performance is to Apple's high standard. I've upgraded from the Iphone7 so all the new features makes it feel like a big upgrade. FaceID gives the impression you don't sign-in to your phone anymore it's that quick. The cameras capture great pics and video even in low light. The phone is bigger and slightly heavy than my previous phone and took a bit of getting used to. Sometimes I'm reaching to tap apps when using the phone single handed.",
