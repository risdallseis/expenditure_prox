            "The Galaxy S10+ is the ultimate expression of everything a phone should be. It's the culmination of a decade of S series innovation. With 2 front cameras and 3 rear cameras, it captures moments exactly as you see them. A new ultra-wide and ultra-zoom lens lets you see the whole scene, and a front-facing portrait lens will help you take flawless photos. It's even got an incredible screen-to-body ratio and packs a powerful battery. "
