            "Ive always had Samsung & This Phone has just been amazing. The storage to the speakers to the performance. I would say though make the screens more durable as it can break easily and some newer models can. Also maybe have a separate earphone port rather than the charger and the earphone together and have durable leather or silicon cases so they dont get dirty quickly and so they are more durable. \n\nEverything else is amazing. Ive always been proud of samsung and I always will be!",
            "I think Samsung have done a good job with this phone. But it feels like they built to a budget.  My S9+  felt more luxurious.   Had a led for messages, charge light etc.  The s20 5g doesn't have these.  Needs more battery.",
            "Great app lovely would Defford recommend to people",
            "Face recognition, ease of use, great pictures. Right size",
            "I have S8 before - the best Samsung S  from the new generation, but  S20 has some issues connecting to any data on the mobile network, inside and sometimes even outside. Never happened with the previous Samsung S series(I had all from S5 onwards).",
            "Have been using S20 5G for two months now and not happy with the quality to say the least.\nFirst: camera button would not work properly, have to press several times for it to finally take a snap; the quality of the photos is not great either.\nSecond: video stories on Instagram and Facebook are flickering; Messenger pop-up is flickering when opening the message. Have re-installed apps, but nothing has changed.",
            "Phone loses battery 2%-3% even if you don't use it. Needs improvement on battery. Overall it's a good phone.",
            "Great phone ,it das as its says on the description..",
            "Bought the phone as a gift for my wife in release date. Absolutely worth it and cannot fault it whatsoever. Strong, reliable, and the S20 5G hit just the right sweetspot with features and size . Thank you Samsung .A true flagship brand.",
            "I hate - HATE - the awful, awful fingerprint scanner. How could you go from such a brilliant system as the S9 to this? Never ever works - and yes, I've followed ALL guides to make it more effective. Never buying a Samsung again.",
            "its look ok but battery not good and its finger print on middle of screen I don't like it",
            "Good spec Samsung galaxy user friendly",
            "Best  price no one can beat  that Screen so clear are perfect  but  don't  like no home button that  I'm  use to it a huge leap for me from S6 to S20.\nI should  have  gone  for s20 plus  big screen.",
            "Very pleased with my phone. Bought on Black friday so the price was excellent. Always buy Samsung phones as they are excellent value for money.",

            "Very good battery and very easy to use.",
            "Purchased this phone a couple of days ago  its what I would call an average phone. I previously owned an HUAWEI P20 Pro and due to the new HUAWEI not having Google I opted for a Samsung phone. Its screen and camera cannot match my old HUAWEI and the battery on my HUAWEI also lasts longer, and to also find out that when you have a glass screen protector fitted to the Samsung the finger print does not work and I have had it taken off and a cheap plastic one fitted. Disappointing.",
            "Received my new s20 5g from Samsung within 24 hours. Excellent service and a great interest free deal. The phone is an upgrade froma trusty Galaxy s6 that I've owned for 5 years. The new phone is so much faster and has lots of additional features. Absolutely blown away with it!",
            "I brought the S20 as an upgrade from the S8. \nI was concerned I wouldn't notice a massive difference between the phones, but boy I was wrong. The camera is the biggest improvement I've found so far, the screen is clearer. I keep the phone in the medium power saving mode, my phone lasts noticeably longer without a change in performance!",
            "Got the Samsung galaxy s20 5g two days ago and I love it .the camera is brilliant and I love the ar.fantastic phone ,wouldn't buy any other phone .Samsung s20 is the best out there .Samsung has really out done themselves with the s20 range.",
            "Love everything about the phone, the camera is awesome to use as it allows you to take either single photo or a set",
            "This is the phone to get in 2020. The size is perfect and it has the best display I have seen in a mobile device. It is very well built and the software is fluid and clean. Pictures and videos are clear as is audio quality. Battery is just OK. Its not poor but its not the best. It will get you through the day but it is a power hungry phone. Having said that the bundled charger charges the phone from flat to full within an hour. I recommend this phone.",
            "Very stylish phone.  Good size and very simple to set up and use.  Camera produces beautiful pictures, clear and bright.  Highly recommended.",
            "Best phone out their destroys any other phone out their. I've actually getting 5 people to switch from apple to Samsung and they all love their phone",
            "So far so good, a short battery could be a problem as not everyone has the opportunity to charge at any time, if it's something that doesn't fit your needs, I would definitely recommend to invest some time into research for a different model.\nIt's perfect for my needs, perfect overall.",
            "Faster, sleeker, better product.\nJust be aware that the phono plug has gone and headphones are either bluetooth or USB C so you may need an adapter for your favourite 'phones - but that's the same as iPhones.",
            "My Samsung s20 5g is great i love it but doesn't quite get 5 stars for me only issue is its abut jumpy playing high graphic games when games get quite fast paced might be something to do with the processor we get in the UK I don't know",
            "Amazing phone just the battery was a bit short! Anyway good overall",
            "I have gone from S7 to S20. I do all the usual and play games. Great having full screen, but how annoying is not having a home button, back button as the S7. So many times it is so useful, playing games etc. I know I will probably get used to it, but it just frustrates me after 2 weeks. Also 3.5mm headphone jack, please bring it back. I have BT headphones, but Galaxy S20 has problems connecting for calls, sometimes its fine others takes about 10 mins of connecting disconnecting before they connect properly. And yes I go through the settings which are all in the right place.",
            "Always buy Samsung products and they never disappoint. Love the camera, the speed, the unlimited calls & texts. Crystal clear screen with the right screen protector. Samsung all the way. I even recommend Samsung products over others in my store as most of my tech is Samsung, apart from my TV which is LG & only because I got it clearance & cheaper with the store I work for. Got to be market leaders in my opinion",
            "Really disappointed from Samsung S20.\n5 Month old phone Lots of problems,\nCharger problem,\nWireless charger has a problem.\nBattery doesn't stay a live even 7 hours just a phone call.",

            "I have upgraded from the S9 straight to the S20....love it so far.\nIt has a few changes that I like, not tried the camera out yet, but hoping it is better than the S9, that was poor compared to the S7. I wasn't happy at first with Samsung doing away with the notification light, but found that I could set \"Message reminder\" on, so if I do miss anything, I don't miss out.",
            "The phone functions and features respond exactly as described. The camera in particular is superb. The phone is stylish, slim and lightweight, best phone for me yet!",
            "The Exynos processor slows down while gaming and fps drops and stutters",
            "I bought the S20 Ultra on pre-order before it came out. So I got the instant release, i did really enjoy it and some of the features. However, with time the battery life is already starting to go down quicker 6 months on and if you actually use it a lot really doesnt last 24 hours. I have also noticed that the camera is really not as good as it was already sometimes it struggles to focus and really doesn't reach the price point it is at. I bought this phone mostly for the camera and video capabilities and recently been disappointed with the quality. \n\nI bought this phone to last me a long time as my previous phone did very well but i am doubtful of this phones ability to last a year. I dont expect a phone at this price point to only last 12 months. \n\nOverall I wouldnt recommend this phone for the cost to how long till it starts to go downhill.",
            "This fone is relly goood end it lets me go throo the hole dey with out losing charge in my fone :D relly goood job Samsong",
            "Cant see what the fuss is about its going to something special to stay with samsung on the next upgrade",
            "10 of 10 thank you samsung for new great  toy good job",
            "I love the sound when I'm listening to music or playing music videos",
            "First of all I want to start with how good I normally find samsung products, I have had numerous tvs of the years, which I've never had fault with and would only ever buy a Samsung TV, I also have the Samsung buds plus which are great headphones, decent battery life as well as good quality. After using Samsung products and having so much success with them in the past I thought I'd venture out into getting a Samsung s20 5g. I've used the phone for just over 6 weeks now so believe I have given it enough of a chance. The screen is of good quality, you can set it onto three settings, I currently have it on the middle setting, I would love to have it on the higher setting but the battery life is virtually none existent when it is on this setting. The motion smoothness is also a good feature, but once again I have to have it set on 60hz as the battery life is none existent if the phone is set on 120hz. The camera is good and the fact you can video in 8k is a cool gimmick, but it felt no better than the camera on my previous phone which was a p30 Pro. The autocorrect could also be improved. The saving grace of the phone is how well it links my other technology in my house given that it is all the same make, however the battery life is just too poor for me, from fully charged it will only last six to seven hours for me whilst I'm at work and I do not always have the means to charge it because there is not always the facilities to do so where I'm working. This is leaving me in a massive dilemma of where I'm going to have to start looking for a new phone after only a month and a half which is leaving a poor taste in my mouth as phones nowadays are not exactly cheap. It is a shame they produce a good phone but just used an insufficient battery in it.",
            "This is my second Samsung phone and I love it. The design of the phone is great and I love the camera quality that has been improved.",
            "Needed to upgrade from my Samsung S7 .looked around to buy a Samsung S20 and Argos was the cheapest. It was easy to set up",
            "Love this phone! Loads of storage and very easy to navigate and use.",
            "It's a very good phone but the battery do not last long.",
            "Works better than expected easy to navigate",
            "Very nice phone with lots of features and no too big",
            "I've had my s20 for almost 4 months now and I couldn't be happier, its so much faster than my old iPhone and the fact that I can use like 3 apps at the same time on one page is mindblowinf to me. Took me a while to get used to no home button but I would never go back to iPhone. Battery life is also so much better than iPhone!",
            "I am on my 3rd handset and this phone is terrible. Although advertised has good for gaming trust me it isn't it struggles to hold stable framerates. For the price you would expect more. I have had Samsung phones for years and trust me this is the worst one ever.",
            "... battery life! \n\nI love my phone but unless it's on battery saving mode it doesn't last a whole day. I used to mock iPhone users for having to carry a charging cable at all times but this is now me.",
            "Very good phone. Superb screen and camera. Battery not too good.",
            "Upgraded from a S9 to a S20 5G. Worthy upgrade with great features including speedy performance (apps and Web pages load very fast), superb camera quality and great display screen. Still exploring as only had it few days. Very happy so far!",
            "Even if camera is the most important improvement for s20 i am not somebody who do a lot of pictures. I use my phone like hotspot net for my tv set, but very often just kick me out, thing which have not hapend with my old s8. Ihope this will improve soon, if is a software issue.",
            "Brilliant phone with a decent battery life. \n\nAmazing screen, one of the best I've seen. Bought it for my wife, and she loves it.\n\nYou have all the features that you'll need if you own this device.",
            "What's the point in designing a phone if every time you want to unlock it with your fingerprint, it doesn't work. So frustrating! After five attempts each time, have to put \nin pin code. Terrible user experience.",
            "Dimply the best phone. A+  Features, software, etc.",
            "I replaced my Samsung s9, which I'd had for 2 years as the battery had began needing to be charged through the day. I now have the s20 5g. Same amount of stuff on phone and in no better place, having to charge 2 or 3 times through the day. \nAnyone else got these issues.\nI went to sure,  where I got it from, they said its down to my bluetooth being switched on??",
            "Unfortunately I \"upgraded\" my Huawei Mate 20 Pro to the S20 Ultra\nTo say its a complete let down is an under statement.\nThe Huawei had a better camera (unless you wanted to take photos of the moon)\nIt was far more robustly built\nAs a phone the s20 is awful, reception and speaker quality is terrible, from experience the mate 20 again beats it on both.\nThe only reason I switched was the lack of Google on the new Huawei phones.\nI'm now paying more for a far inferior phone and regret my decision to change.\nAs an example I've given my sister in law the Huawei, both in the same place on the same network, Samsung absolutely no reception, Huawei 2 bars.\nIf you want great screen resolution fine, if youvwant a phone don't bother",
            "Great device, camera quality on the back camera is fantastic! (Added an example of a photo I took) charges quickly and battery lasts. Ive had no issues with the s20 as of yet and I'm very happy with the product!",
            "Your Service is very good I  Really Appreciate you",
            "the camera is not as good as the s10 it dont seem to like reds or pink things if your taking pictures of flowers it just looks like blobs of colour .and dont come out the right colour pink looks red",
            "The reason I buy Samsung and not iPhone is because I don't expect the screen to smash if accidentally dropped at work. I've always bought galaxy but this will be the last.",
            "Fantastic phone. The picture quality is absolutely amazing. Battery life is great too. The phone looks amazing too! I really can’t complain.",
            "For starters after every new contact i add to the phonebook i have to restart the phone to save the phone number. If I do not restart the phone is not saving the number/new contact.\nEvery time I open a folder, doesn't matter if is it empty or have some files in it, takes way too long to open. Up to 10-12 minutes. I have to open/close/open the folder a few times to manage to see what's inside.\nWhen I open an app and after another one and another one. And I want to switch between them the phone opens always the first app. To manage to see all the apps opened I actualy have to close them, or it will open the same app over and over.\nI tried a factory reset and nothing. The first app that I open is the only app that it will show even when I try to chose a new one, it opens the first app that I have opened.\nEvery software update brings a new bug.\nThe last night update destroyed the zoom. Doesn't matter where I use the zoom, it pixelate the image and takes way too much to depixelate. Now after I use the zoom I have to move the image around to force the depixelate of the text or image.\nEvery update brakes something. A few updates ago the touch was damaged. I had to press every botton a few times to work. Then the bug was fixed with the 2 updates ago and reintroduced with the last update. Now I have to press a few times on every button to work. Again!!!\nWhat in the name of god are you doing there with the system?\nFor a s20 5G ultra is worse than a '90 phone. The loading times are awful. I'm using like 2 GB ram from the 12GB and still is frickin slow. 12 minutes to open a folder.......... Even after a factoiy reset.",
            "I love my S20+ great phone and features. However 5minutes outside in sunlight or bright overcast light and the screen  brightness dims to a unreadable screen the brightness slider does nothing even at maximum. Turning off adaptive brightness does nothing. This problem is all over the forums but Samsung still haven't fixed it. Porr fir such an expensive phone.",
            "phone is good best Samsung mobile phone so far only thing is my battery seems to go down fast till it hits the 40s",
            "This is a good phone with good camera. :) dfsdfsdf",

            "I started from galaxy S2 and I every year's I change my phone to the new series of the galaxy Note and few of galaxy S series and as a professional phone user I can say my new Samsung galaxy S20 Ultra 5G is a best Samsung semaphores witch I had and It is the best smartphone in the world at the moment. I have to say thanks Samsung for it.",
            "Love the camera,  still need time to sit down and investigate how things work.",
            "This is the worse phone I have ever had. Wont delete emails, restricted to what you can download as just hangs. Screen keeps going black and freezes. Permanently turning it off and on to try and get phone to unfreeze for one reason or the other. Contacted 02 not interested. My advice run a mile.",
            "The phone (as usual) is very good for my needs,  although slightly narrower than my S9+☹, the disappointing thing about the phone is the headphones  - it can have the best sound quality,  but  unfortunately this is no good if they keep falling out of your ears  - I was hoping that the design had been changed from those supplied with the S9+, but no. Weirdly they seem to fit better upside down, (but still fall out), Why can't they adopt the same design as my Bose sound sports, with wings to secure them in place - I do not know ( I mean  thats why I bought the Bose in the first place). I know the sound quality of AKG  headphones are usually very good- I have have 5 pairs of over ear ones at home.  So come on Samsung  - I know you own AKG, let's see an improvement on your in ear phone fitment.",
            "Nice product and will pay again",
            "really pleased with purchase has everything i wanted",
            "bought mid June phone it's self great. The screen however is too fragile I thought at one point the the the screen by the camera had cracked it hadn't but the only way I could describe it was like a sugar coating over the camera cleaned that off. I haven't \n  dropped the phone only put it in my hand bag when I took it out there was the tiniest chip on the screen.  Personally I think their is a fault with the s20 and just hope they recall it. A lot of money paid for a phone that is so fragile",
            "So far I used its really good to use...",
            "Good phone, sim free, very happy",
            "I like Samsung products but specifically, S20 cannot connect to the internet most of the time during the day, when I receive phone calls others complaint that cannot hear me, and battery drains too quick for a new phone.",
            "Purchased for my mum as her Samsung broke, she was quite nervous at choosing a new phone so she stuck with galaxy as she previously had the s7. Not only is the S20 a good looking phone, the camera is incredible and she finds everything a lot easier and a longer battery life. The delivery and service from Argos have been incredible thank you!",
            "I have moved from Apple IPhone 11 Pro to Samsung Galaxy S20 and love it, I love the Design and feels premium, Great Camera, Great Display, Best Specs, Love the in screen Fingerprint. Want to buy the Galaxy S20 LED Cover to with it but waiting for price to come down. Definitely recommend both phone and case.",
            "I upgraded from a Galaxy S9 to a S20 5G. I really wish I didn't now. After all the hype of the S20, I am quite disappointed. I actually prefer my S9.",
            "it's very fast i happy with this phone",
            "Superb phone, camera- excellent. Slow motion video- on another level !!. I upgraded from the S9 (Another fantastic piece) to this. 5G is ridiculously fast. Video playback is awesome, it takes about an hour to fully charge and the battery life is awesome....Icould go on all day about how great this phone is!! By far the BEST phone on the market. If your looking to upgrade, go for this one.",
            "everything is brilliant except the option for home screen to auto rotate when on stand or horizontal and you want to navigate through apps and browser and the home screen and everthing is stuck on vertical aside from that really really please with my new phone",
            "I have had Samsung phones for about 8 years and was really looking forward to this new phone, but the design leaves much to be desired. The 2 side buttons are almost impossible to depress without a 3rd hand (used for restart etc). Doing screenshots by swiping is useless and opens Smart Select instead 90%.of the time. The screen usually takes 2 presses to select buttons/items. Think I will switch back to my S8 and sell this.",
            "I was hoping for some improvement from my 2 year old S9 but I find myself still choosing to use it over my shiny new S20. My S9 charges faster, and holds its battery better, which is really saying something as the terrible S9 battery life was my reason for upgrading. The face recognition is as flaky as it was on the S9. The phone comes with a stupidly short charging cable. I purchased the clear view case to protect the phone and it makes the phone so annoying to hold and use. I even prefer the S9 camera. The finger print scanner is also annoyingly located. All in all, I wouldn't bother with this phone. Unless you're upgrading from the S7, you won't notice the difference. Not thrilled I'm stuck with it for 3 years on O2 either!",
            "It is a good phone. I was expected the battery to last longer.",
            "just the best phone out there!\n\nCame from a S9 to the S20 and I have not regret it easy to set up easy to use and straightforward what more do you need in a Andorid handset",
            "It's exactly what I wanted. I'm very pleased",
            "i do like the phone. But it randomly restarts once or twice a day. Can be really frustrating when im using navigation while driving. Please help ke get this sorted.",
            "The camera is excellent. All apps run very smooth. I am still using a 4G sim card but the Internet seems quicker.",
            "camera is amazing along with easy to use features much better then my old model",
            "Just like the S8 this S20 overheats when you are using Tom Tom satnav and charging at the same time.",
            "Amazing phone totally love my s20 5g everything is perfect about an s20 perfect size solid build. Its the best phone their is",
            "I absolutely love this phone and it's features but this is my second phone within two weeks as the first one over heated now this phone is doing the same thing. I'm worried that it could cause me problems with my sim card and sd card and eventually burn out or something also the battery life is shocking i have to charge it twice a day otherwise it will be dead by tea time. Just gutted as I would've gone for the ultra but thought the s20 would be OK. But two many problems with it.",
            "In my opinion the S10 was just as good, a very expensive upgrade for a camera.",
            "Excellent phone unbelievably responsive great camera superb battrey life.",
            "Great screen,Great camera,if you like the Samsung Galaxy family this is for you",
            "great phone however it keeps freezing needs sorting out, I would have given 5 stars but because of that issue only 4 stars.",

            "It was ok.  I’ve had Samsung since the s7. But s20 was time to say goodbye \nYes camera was good.  But phone was just not a big enough jump from s10 plus.   \nVery disappointed so returned and got I phone 11 pro instead. \nGutted as Samsung is in my blood",
            "The main reason I have Samsung is because I like the Android technology. The phone does what it should but often freezes if I change between phone calls. Not as good as the Huawei P20 Pro that I had before.",
            "Absolutely love the camera on this phone. Phone its self is to a high standard as you would come to expect from Samsung. All round a great phone",
            "The advert is propaganda. The camera is average. Also just because there is a Samsung app for certain things doesnt mean I want it waved in my face while I'm trying to use other apps",
            "love how smooth and fluid the phones screen is and the camera is top quality.",
            "I'm loving my new s20 everything about it camera performance style",
            "very pleased with this phone very easy to use with very good  features",
            "I always buy the smaller pocket size higher spec model every year.\nSamsung did not disappoint, with the overall style & features of S20 5G.\nSlightly bigger/better screen, better processor & ram to play my games etc.\nBigger battery & faster charging is important to me as I'm never to far away from my phone.\nAlthough I don't use camera as much as I should, pictures are definitely better quality.\nSo it's a big thumbs up from me",
            "Big upgrade from my old galaxy s9. Camera is great and the battery lasts all day.",
            "l love this phone. Prefer the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone though. The fingerprint sensor on this phone not as good as my old S9. Otherwise this phone is great.",
            "generally speaking this is an excellent phone, which builds on and improves earlier models in terms of performance, especially the camera. The only criticism I have is that, where the screen on my old S8 survived for years unmarked, but within a couple of weeks there are already a couple of small dings/marks on the screen of this model and I hope this doesn't signal Samsung following the path of Apple to try and force early phone updates by having too delicate screens?",
            "The galaxy s20 is a good phone with a great camera. I have still never had 5g on it but will be more down to service provider than phone.",
            "the camera is amazing and its even easier to use. Outstanding",
            "Love the Samsung S20. I've read up on it features before purchase and I have no regret. Am especially interested in taking very clean and beautiful photos with it's dynamic camera. The only downside to this phone is that you can't charge it whilst listening to music and it doesn't have a plugin end for music set.",
            "love the look of the phone and how fast apps work on it",
            "its a great device very good capabilities on camera.",
            "i always upgrade every 2 years so i skipped the s10, well worth the wait!",
            "I regularly change my phones but the last two updates have been very minimal in their excitement. The S20 is just too similar to the S10 and S9s I had previously. Will probably not go for Samsung next time as need something different with new features. Don’t get me wrong the S20 is perfectly competent but is no longer top of the Android pack. Shame really!",
            "It over heat it cash when using it the signal is no good i am disappointed I waited months for this phone",
            "No better than the S9 or even the S10e. Not impressed at all.",
            "pretty happy with new toy, not totally convinced on the x30 camera as the pictures not as clear as they are made out to be. Other than that pretty decent. Keep up the good work guys.",
            "great camera and the 5g is really quick. phone is nice size and not too heavy a perfect daily companion to help me through my day",
            "I have this phone for about a month now love it so far. I’m still trying to discover the new features particularly on the camera side. I couldn’t afford the larger model but settled for the galaxy S20 5G.",
            "The functionality is brilliant. I use my mobile for business and investments. Information and alerts are at my fingertips. The camera makes video conferencing enjoyable. It is a PC in the palm of my hand. I recommend it.",
            "I loved my s9 so I was excited when my contract ended and I had to upgrade. I seen the 5g S20 and thought that would be a great upgrade from my previous device. Unfortunately I feel really let down by this model. Firstly, after putting the device in my pocket for the first time the screen had multiple scratches on it, one deep scratch right in the middle. I had a couple of coins in my pocket but I took the phone out as soon as I heard them chink. I was shocked to see that the screen had damaged straight away after such little friction. There's also a small bubble coming in the corner of the screen which I have no idea why as I have now bought a case following the first incident. The headphone jack is now the same as the charger which is frustrating  as you now cannot use both at the same time. The software features feel pretty much the same as the s9 with little change. The fingerprint scanner is so frustrating as it takes multiple tries to unlock the phone. I always end up using the drawing pattern to unlock it. There's a 5g tower less than a mile from my home yet I've never seen this phone pick up a 5g signal. During this Covid19 lockdown I have tried multiple times to video call my partner but the signal is so bad sometimes I just give up and end the call. The keyboard is an absolute nightmare. I've increased the keyboard to its full size but the keys are still small and the space bar is non existent and it constantly puts a full stop between words instead. The autocorrect is terrible. Simple words like \"you\" do not get corrected when spelt wrong yet it changes words like \" because\" to \"beguiled\" for example. So frustrating as I always have to go back over my texts to correct them myself. The opening and closing of apps can often be slow or just randomly close on their own. Its a very nice looking device and it has all the features of my previous model which I really enjoyed but overall I feel as though its the same phone but with more faults and a higher price. I was debating to buy an IPhone 11 instead but thought I would be better off sticking with Samsung as I had such a great device before. I'm not sure if its just their device I have that is such a let down or if the S20 range are all like this. I'm currently in the process of trying to amend my contract so that I can switch to Apple beguiled I feel like I have been sold an inferior product due to so many of its faults",
            "Am really pleased with my S20 5G  in Cloud Blue. Nice and easy to set up.  Quick charghing with pretty good battery life conmsidering am using the phone more than usual at the moment due to home working. \n\nWorks very fast when downloading and using 5G in London where I live. Have not had any issues with dropping signal since having the phone. Works well in sync with other devices for email, music and the like. \n\nDecent speakers for playing music on. Enjoying the earphones which connect using the charging port means less holes in the phone to gather dust.\n\nAmazing screen quality and so clear. \n\nA purejoy to use this phone",
            "my mother in law bought it for me as a gift its the best phone by far I had the s9 before .its nothing compared to the s20 im so happy with  it .",
            "Am so pleased with the S20 5G phone.  Quick to set up and transfer data from previous Samsung device over using the cable or via bluetooth.  I used via the cable. Easy to use and i love the intuitiveness of the phone as it has now started giving me tips and suggestions on things to do like Bixby Good Morning set up.  \n\nVery easy to sync to other Samsung devices in particular Galaxy Smartwatch.  Battery life is pretty decent, i get a good 2 hours from it, usually charge up around 7pm evey night.  Using the cable and charger that comes with the phone in box, takes a little over an hour from around 5% to full charge.  \n\nHighly recommend this phone. \n\nScreen is amazing quality and so clear.  By far the best screen i have had on a mobile device.",
            "it's a bit of a disappointment to be honest other buttons pop up on the screen when making calls and phone gets hot, not as good as my s9.",
            "Had to send phone back twice due to the same fault which is apparently a common fault which was the echoing that the person who I was speaking to could hear themselves repeat what they had said the phone was unusable to make calls due to this also there was dead pixels in the screen which was like that on the day I got the second replacement.  Such a shame as the rest of the phone was good and so was my s9 too .",
            "I was so pleased to take up a Samsung two years ago and today I am confirming that this was the best decision ever, I love my new S20, slim line, easy to use, the transfer of data was incredibly easy to do myself. Great features and the camera is outstanding.",
            "Slim design, great camera. Lots of apps. Instructions to transfer data could have been easier though",
            "not sure I love anything about it the camera isn't as good as its made out to be and the rest of the phones features are barely different to my galaxy s9",
            "lovely new design, great feel in the hands, not too big, but not small, great for watching movies, the only thing I would say is there's no motion capture on stills images like there is in the Plus, but the water proofing is great! \nFeels good... Works really well, cant fault the screen super vivid colours",
            "At first I wasn't sure but now 2 months down the line it's a very good phone. Easy to use. Samsung has done very well with this model",
            "Keeps freezing all the time not happy with that part of it",
            "I love the vivid quality of the screen.  I love the camera quality, with more than one lens it makes images look a bit more surreal rather than a flat image and when taking pictures you could add your own filter.  I am happy that I have the option to add more storage to my already 128gb storage, which I did.  I like the full view of the screen.  I like the security features.  This phone adds another level to my previous phone (Galaxy S6 Edge) even though I'm not found of the plastic back.  I did love the feel of my previous phone with both sides being glass, it's definitely lighter than this phone, with it's thin edge, the phone also being and feeling thin between your fingers.  If I was to weight up the pros against the con (only being 1 so far), the con would still not put me off.  I have been a Samsung user for the last 9 years and staying to the Galaxy range, I have not been disappointed each time.",
            "Clean lines.  Intuitive response and a camera I’ve yet to fully explore.",
            "Great phone s20 series is definitely a go to phone features are amazing camera is very good \nBut it needs to have a portrait mode similar to iPhone",
            "It's a great phone but it's not compatible with some apps that I used on my s10",
            "Nice to hold camera is improved \nhighly recommend it to anyone",
            "Stunning phone. Takes amazing quality photos,  so simple to use and navigate",

            "so easy to use and a very high quality camera phone",
            "Tried multiple adapters and ever bought the generic Samsung one and it still will not connect audio from usb-c to 3.5mm leaves a sour taste when you have paid nearly 1000 for a phone that doesn't have simple audio output that an older generation phone could. Looks like my loyalty to Samsung is over....... if anyone from Samsung wants to help then feel free to email me......",
            "Easy to use, great camera, was easy to transfer apps from my old phone.",

            "Great phone . But still think volume could be better for music",
            "the phone itself is decent  the camera is a big improvement.. one thing that frustrates me is the fingerprint unlock.. fails to work 8 times out of 10... its so annoying",
            "Don’t love it, freezes and already sent it back after 2months but Samsung don’t do anything about it prefer to go to iPhone and can’t stand iphones",
            "There's really very little to be awed by this device. I was expecting much more than a rehashed S10",
            "Again Samsung fail to disappoint, great features, superb camera, awesome battery life!! Absolute magic!!",
            "I have had previous Samsung phones in the past. And if anything they just keep getting better. Their easy to use and a good quality phone",
            "This is hardly an upgrade. The iffy fingerprint sensor which is one of my biggest bugbear with the S10 is still there albeit with slight positioning improvement. The Exynos version heats up a lot and is slower than the Snapdragon version (when will samsung learn?). I can't really see any improvements in the cameras either. What a waste!",
            "sleek lines. Great camera, does what it says on the packet\nOnly fault is build. On my previous Samsung the rear glass cover has tended to crack. My S20 5g had a broken screen after just 3 weeks and that was with one drop from waist height against a shelf of a bookcase and on to a carpeted floor.\nNot happy to say the least. We shouldn't need to wrap these devices in big clumsy cases to protect them.",
            "love this phone so easy to use camera great so light fits great in my bag",
            "Fingerprint unlock is aweful! Overall love everything else about the phone but a) takes long to unlock and b) doesn't unlock on the first attempt. I've checked with my friends and they have also got the same issue. Its worse than my iPhone 5! Samsung s9 was much better too.",
            "Got rid of my s9 can't see much difference to be honest",
            "my new s20 5g is out of this world. I love it and its a big part of my life",
            "Full stop very sticky and have to hit it several times before it actually works. Switching off device has also changed and awkward to hold both buttons down",
            "Having decided to upgrade after my old Samsung gave up on me I was really excited to get the S20 on release day. I've never has a new phone on the first day of availability before. \n\nThe phone is great. Really intuitive and straight forward to use. I'm learning about the features all the time and love all the little features of the camera. \n\nLove it!",
            "Absolutely love the S20 5G. Lighting speed at all tasks, next level camera and an improvement on battery life. I also love the feel of the phone.",
            "I'm still learning what everything does. I love the camera. The AR emojis are amazing too. I just love it.",
            "I’m really pleased with usability, great battery and great support",
            "Some good features but it would be nice if Samsung Internet could be updated to play BBC media videos hopefully this will be addressed soon.",
            "I bought a brand new Samsung s20. I was so disappointed. I was charging the phone around 3 to 4 times away. So I sent it back and got the s10 note. Other than the occasional freeze and apps closing down on me. Im very happy. The screen is great quality with vibrant colours. Which I love! The size of phone is acceptable. Any smaller or bigger it wouldn't be great for me. As I have rheumatoid arthritis so holding a heavy or small phone would be rather painful.  I find the s10 note just right with a flip case. Only thing I would say is the protective film on the screen could do with being upgraded as when I removed my phone from my handbag the screen protector was scratched to high heaven. The camera on the phone is nice and crisp with good quality vibrancy. The camera if you wish to turn this option on informs you of where to point your camera for the best possible shot. Ive not been let down yet. \nThe note is also very good for highlighting text and copying. I found it difficult with a normal phone to highlight a specific part of text and copy it. With the spen its so much easier. Also the spen options allow you to draw and colour in templates. A really good calming feature for those who like it. \nAll in all the S10 note is a very good phone and recommend it highly",
            "Upgraded finally from a Samsung Galaxy S7. The difference is amazing. After nearly 3 months with the S20 I am very pleased with this phone. Quick charger, fast browsing, packed with features and looks great. Bravo",
            "The best Samsung galaxy yet, has better, camma & extras",
            "very good quality but poor signal and I won't be buying another Samsung",
            "I've used many phones due to my job, and no matter what phone I'm using in work, I always love coming back to my S20 5G (I felt the same about my S10+ previously)\n\nCamera is brilliant, screen is beautiful, and the size is perfect.",
            "Love the phone dont love the lack of help trying to solve a problem took 3 weeks for samsung to act",
            "Its a Galaxy S series. It is what it is. I have had everyone since the S5. You know you're getting a decent phone. On every Galaxy I have had I have always had intermittent Internet connection issues, which I don't know whether its network or phone - more likely the network (EE). The key let down on this phone is the camera, its poor at best. Massive disappointment and I will probably change phone ASAP and will much more likely be looking at something other than Samsung as a result. Everything else on the phone though seems decent enough",
            "Easy to use. Charging is super fast. Downloading  super fast too..",
            "The great features of the S20 are similar to S10 not much difference \n\nNot so great features. Cannot use the S20 cable with my in-car charger. This is a big issue when you rely on your phone as your satnav. \nIn addition to this you've made it difficult to use any earphones with S20 without getting expensive ones from Samsung. doesnt help the average customer's budget",
            "the s20 is not all its made out to be I preferred the s8.",
            "Easy to use, a natural upgrade & loving the camera",
            "still learning things with this phone.  I like the features and the way it holds in my hand .cant fault this phone at the moment. The camera is great and pictures are good . The screen seems faultless.  Very happy I've jumped from to S9 to the S20 5G . I'm sure there's more to do with this phone and looking forward to finding new way to capture life as I use this phone",
            "The phone generally is great, larger screen, significantly better camera. But coming from the S9 I cannot get past the new biometric unlocking, its just so rubbish, takes ages to register and makes the phone incompatible with screen protectors or shell phone cases. Honestly overall I think I preffered my S9!",
            "not the best choice & in my opinion should have chosen S9 or S10.\nThe battery doesn't last ie S8 lasted longer. Microphone not the best, people struggle to hear when on speaker, I struggle to hear when listening. \nSome features which previously worked on last phone don't work at all.\nBasically avoid, Samsung need to improve.",
            "I love the colour blue and the camera is amazing. The only thing I don't like is the loudspeaker at the top when on calls as it is very difficult to hear, get exactly on the ear and not comfortable to hold the phone.\nThe display is amazing very vivid.",
            "I have always liked Samsung phones and this one meets all expectations so pleased with it.",
            "Great speed. Loving the face recognition unlock and the overall speed of the phone.",
            "Amazing phone as always from Samsung, the best smartphone manufacturer in the world. Great display, with all the latest features.",
            "I lovw everything except the size if the screen its bigger than my previous s9 but would like it to be slightly wider",
            "I love it love infects on it everything I like the colour",
            "I was very excited to get my new Samsung S20 as I thought it would be a serious improvement to my last phone. The promise of a groundbreaking camera and Innovation all round left me very disappointed. The camera is so frustrating especially fhe selfie camera because it's always looks blurry and airbrushed especially on using apps such as Snapchat and Instagram it looks like it's been taken with an archaic BlackBerry. Not a lot of changes since the S10 I feel quite underwhelmed on what the phone has to over. Next year I will switch to apple's latest handset, as I feel let down by this phone and I don't expect things to change in the future. I spoke to customer services and they said the camera would be fixed with the next update. Two updates later nothing has changed. after being with Samsung for you this is most likely to be my last Samsung phone for a while.",
            "I don't glass smashed after 1 week on the back not good at all and very expensive to repair",
            "Like all Samsung phones the Galaxy S20 5G is better than my old S9 but sill has the annoying Bixby. The S20 would be the best phone on the market if i could disable Bixby.",
            "it brilliant I love it very much i would recommend it to my friends",
            "I've had Galaxy phones since the S2 and they have always been great quality phones. I recently got the S20 5G as a backup phone and must say its a great little phone and now I'm using it as my main phone instead of my Galaxy note 10 Plus.",
            "simple easy to use, even if you haven't had any s series of phone before. Good features and apps, camera is great.",
            "it's loads better than I expected. The camera takes fantastic photos, although I'm still learning how to use all the settings for different shots.",
            "Best I've ever had love my pink s20, so many features and the camera is amazing!!!!",
            "The best smartphone I've ever had to deal with. Excellent processor, unique look and quality of photos and videos knocking down",
            "Great looking  easy use , fast processing, long life battery. I would recommend s20 to everyone",
            "love the phone only think  that tickle me a bit was there was no place to plug in a ear phone jac I had to buy the Connector peace  and to charge the same time you can't use charge and ear phones the same time other wise",
            "Superb cameras,  to many features to list, I've only had the device for a couple of months, still trying to navigate through the many features.",
            "I never had the S10 as my contract is 2 year periods, so as an upgrade from the S9 it is absolutely amazing. Amazing camera and the 5g download and Internet roaming speed is brilliant. I've only had it a couple of days so I've not even been through everyone's yet. Top notch device from arguably the best phone company.",
            "love the camera but phone is little different to s9",
            "Good camera although some software issues.  connection to WiFi has been a problem and unresolved",
            "I just think that it is the best phone that I have had ever.",
            "had the s9, so upgraded, love the super fast charger and long battery life... the loss of the bixby button is amazing and camera is great... overall just an impressive upgrade from the s9.",
            "Screen can be 'sticky' trying to navigate. Also habit of switching itself off and having to restart. Great camera",
            "Great looking phone, works better than my S10 however, camera if used for a time makes the phone very hot to touch which is a concern plus thought there would be more features with the camera software to interact with, ie, portrait mode, soft fade filter so just sharp on subject matter etc..\nIt may well be on here but hard to find features...",
            "it is a good phone but not as good as the galaxy s10 plus, wish I didn't upgrade.",
            "Great battery life great screen easy to use fab camera",
            "love the colour but calls keep dropping off. have put back to factory settings and still the same",
            "thought it may have been a bit more advanced, i have 2 sim cards in and only seem to get reception on one at a time I have to keep changing cards, otherwise I'm really happy with it",
            "Lovely and great phone still getting use to all the new stuff on it , thanks Samsung",
            "The phone gets super hot and the battery does not last long. I was using a Samsung S8 for 3 years before this, and the only major difference I have noticed is that this phone has a better camera. I regret upgrading to the S20 because it doesn't feel like I have upgraded at all. Waste of money.",
            "The new display is amazing. The camera is amazing. The fast charging is amazing. The processing speed is amazing. I absolutely love your brand and product. I have been with you guys since the days of the S3 and never looked back. \n\nStill adapting to life without a headphone jack. I had a dilemma when I was using the phone for a Zoom chat with the earphones you supply, and about half way through, needed to rush to put it on charge, and switch to my bluetooth headphones.\n\nFinally, I don't know if it's just because I am using it a lot during lockdown, but it gets quite hot? Not a tech guy myself, so am not sure if it's possible in such a small device but a cooling pad like some laptops have would be pretty neat to stop my fingers from getting sweaty. Unless that would price people out or compromise other capabilities. Just a thought.",
            "no faults other than battery could be better and the keyboard doesn't seem to learn words to autocorrect? Although the necessary functions are set",
            "Great phone, took some time to get the hang of it and graphics are amazing, the sound is quality.\nThe one downfall so far is that it says 5g but yet I have never connected to it, it is on and I can't find out why I can't connect.",
            "Samsung's have mostly been my go to phone I started out with the S2 and have had them all except the S5. Camera's have always been great for me, love the user interface it's got better overtime and now it's reached its peak it's perfect for me. The only thing I'm missing is Samsung's notification light one of my favourite features!!! I've always preferred the smaller galaxy's and the S20 is a great fit in the hand very sleek and premium feeling.",
            "happy with the phone just not happy am not getting 5g atm",
            "Nice phone still getting used to it.\nI do have 1 issue and that is my Samsung 9 used to flash to say there is a message but this one doesn't unless I need to turn something on.  I also don't get a number on the text app.",
            "Simple. An amazing peace of mobile technology that has all the features that you could ever need and an amazing camera to boot.",
            "love the camera and how quick the device is. Charges very fast. However only downfall is not having a headphone jack as love listening to music on the phone but hate the headphones the device comes with.",
            "zooms in and out great. Face recognition is gr and much quicker to get on your phone",
            "The S20 is a good quality, well built and overall great phone, however my house mate has the S10 and I'm not sure there is a big enough difference to justify the extra cost. The screen resolution seems the same and camara quality on both phones are very good. There may be a few extras on the S20 but I personally don't use them so i find myself wondering if it would have been better to save the money and have the S10? My S20 is 5G but as yet it is not available where I live. It might be different when 5G is nation wide. It looks great and seems very sturdy. My baby has thrown it a few times and no damage so far.",
            "Smart  phone. Does everything  I  need and more. You really need to play with it to learn all the things it does.",
            "The phone is second to none  be grateful for the review you got instead of telling me its too short",
            "its good, like really good, like really really good",
            "such a cute bubblegum pink and the camera is amazing, although apart from that no different from my old s8. I also really wish there was the pulse monitor that was on the s8 and s10, as someone with health issues it was super handy!",
            "I like the speed of the new device and the colours on the screen.  The camera (now i have worked out how to focus it) is also really good.  I am missing the led light on the front to see what notifications I have without touching my phone.  Also REALLY REALLY miss the fingerprint sensor on the back of this phone. Bit of  shame, have had it nearly a month and already missing my S9.",
            "camera is amazing. Love this phone. Would recommend it to everyone.",
            "Ease of use and camera. Night mode is good. Intuitive phone and user friendly",
            "I went to the Galaxy S20 Huawei P20 Pro\nHad it now for a few months, so far not as good as expected compared to the Huawei P20 Pro, the handset feels cheap and plastic and camera not as good as the Huawei, up until the Huawei i was always a Samsung owner,but after this my mind is made up, will not be getting a Samsung next time",
            "i regret changing from the s10 to the s20 so much, thr camera focus and quality has been terrible, advertised as an upgrade but really a downgrade",
            "Phone has several really good features & performs well. Only minor gripe I have is when I set the alarm whilst the phone is in vibration mode, it doesn't ring with sound it just vibrates despite the alarm being set to a ring tone.",
            "Very slik design. Although this phone really needs a robust case to protect it, which when installed detracts from the feel of this very nice piece of kit. Camera interface could be more user friendly.",
            "The phone overall works well and battery life alongside performance are good. The one main issue with the phone is the fragility, the phone was dropped from no more than 30com for the first time a couple of weeks in to ownership and the screen has cracked excessively for the height it was dropped from. I've previously owned Samsung which have been much sturdier built and this is the biggest disappointment with the phone.",
            "The photos from the camera are so crisp and clear. \nI also like the features of at work, in the care modes. Saves the battery at night as well.",
            "This has to be the best handset I have ever purchased to date. The new features are fantastic from the improved camera to the super fast charging this handset is perfect. yet to use the 5G as this is not available in my area as of yet.",
            "Perfect fit was concerned the phone would be to big for my hand. Screen is a great size aswell.",
            "This is my second Samsung phone as originally I have been an apple fan since day one, then as a buisness user I found apple apps for cad drawings,Zip files could not be opened via apple systems so I was introduced to Samsung and all I can say is WOW, everything about samsung as most of my house is samsung also performs as it should and beyond, the speed , the ease, how it easily faultlessly connects to any Bluetooth system I ask it to works, the only complaint I have is that I bought this phone pre order and was promised air buds then a week after buying it was told sorry can't have them now because we have withdrawn the offer but if you get the next model up you can have them !!!!, not happy about that as that was what was sold to me however as a phone great performer won't go back to apple now as I personally  feel its like a kids phone compared to this I feel samsung have it right a phone thats great for buisness, personal use with loads of power amazing photos and definitely a phone for grown ups. I am about to purchase the flip phone for my wife. Keep going samsung",
            "mine keeps freezing on the keyboard not overly good with thay",
            "This is my first 2star review.Always give 5stars but this time very disappointing,mobile get extremely  overheating when playing or multitasking.I think this is my last year with samsung before I've used note 9 all was fine but camera shutters  was failing,s10 very laggy.",
            "I love everything about the new S20, the camera, the speed, the battery - everything. \nOnly thing that really annoyed me was that the wi-fi calling option (which I heavily rely on in the office) wasn't working although we did everything correctly with the network provider etc. But recently after the recent update it has finally appeared! so I'm back to 100% happy again :) \n\nI made my friend upgrade to the s20 as well, she's definitely happy with it.",
            "I feel the touch screen is not as good as my s9. I like the fingerprint feature better than the s9.",
            "Not to impressed you asked for me to review this phone im doing that",
            "samsung phones get better each year.\nImproving all the time",
            "Screen is so crystal clear images almost look real. Operations are very fast and smooth. Love this new phone!",
            "Phone stops detecting second sim card, sometimes several times within a few hours. Very annoying and affects my work. Only progress compared to my previous S8 is the better camera.",
            "Coming from the galaxy S9 I have been pleased on the whole. Day to day use is not too different between the two. The faster charging has made a big difference as I'm often moving from one place to another. However I find connecting to WiFi networks can often be more difficult then the s9 and will regularly have to move closer to the router in order to connect (within 1 or two meters) once it has connect then it will hold the connection well",
            "I have always been a fan of Samsung and the smoothness of the operating system and the super fast charging are superb",
            "I love this phone. So easy to use. The camera is amazing. One happy customer. The LED phone case is also great!",
            "Great camera slick design affordable price \nFast charging",
            "Did not have it for long my provider decided to charge me for damage they done to my S9 so got S9 back now",
            "Like how it feels in my hands, live the camera and the memory size",
            "I have no complaints! Love the new camera and how quick my new phone is.",
            "Love my S20, the camera is awesome! All the greatness Samsung always delivers. Finding new things everyday. If any complaint i don't think the fingerprint identity works as well as it did on my S8. I preferred it being on the back.",
            "I bought the S20 when it first came out after previously owning a S9 which I loved . And I can honestly say I wish I had stuck with my S9 . The finger print on the S20 is a joke constantly having to put my finger repeatedly to unlock my phone . And sometimes being told doesn't recognise my print so have to then use the pin to unlock my phone.  Battery life is OK but still find myself having to charge my handset 2-3 times a day . Overall wish I had just stuck with my S9 and very very disappointed with the S20.",
            "Its the perfect size, especially since it's mostly screen, features are epic, so much stuff you didn't know you could ever need until you use it. Hole punch is wicked, battery life is ok but could be better since I moved from Huawei. There's also a noticeable difference between Snapdragon and Exynos Models which shouldn't exist! But great no matter what you buy.",
            "the camera is excellent and the fluidity of the scrolling is amazing its fast and great to own.\nMy only gripe is my phone sometimes freezes for no reason I wouldn't say there is many things open to cause such issues and for that fact I can only give 4 stars I would of given 5 if the freezing of my screen was not happening.",
            "Phone looks amazing and feels it. But.....battery life is awful compared to my Huawei P20pro which is a direct copy across from so the same apps and services\n\nThere is also a terrible bug on some apps like chrome or some news paper apps, it suddenly freezes, can take from a few seconds to minutes to unfreeze\n\nCamera is not a blow away as I thought. Except night mode which is very good\n\nHad lots of galaxy s phones and this is the most....blah of them all",
            "the phone was easy to set up. Transfer the info. And pics are great.",
            "lovely phone, works well. Clear screen and great quality.",
            "Its samsung at its best, the camera is better, clarity when using the phone and the bigger range of applications available",
            "phone is slow an the touchscreen isnt up to much either",
            "Great camera. The clarity of the pictures is amazing.",
            "only has pho e for around 3 weeks so I haven't fully explored all features yet. What I can say though is that it has a great camera. Some movements are opposite to my last phone but it will get easier. For some reason the key pad can be temperamental keeps changing to upper case the same with space bar. Fingerprint does always work but I blame this on corona virus hands are dryed out from washing and alcohol gel.",
            "I went from a galaxy note 9 to the S20 5G. I cant really tell the difference apart from screen size. The main differences is there is no jack for normal headphones and there is no notification LED.\nThe no Notification LED is a major dis-appointment as I now cant tell when Ive had a notification unless I turn my screen on. If I knew there was no LED for notifications I wouldnt have purchased this phone. Overall very underwhelmed.",
            "the battery needs charging 3 times a day, it gets stupidly hot when on a call or charging",
            "Samsung phones always have amazing cameras but this is really at another level",
            "my batteru doesnt last the whole day,and i thought it would as it is the new flagship model for 5g",
            "I like the s20 but I prefer my s10 plus the only thing its a bit better is the camera.",
            "Its so functional and quick as well, its easy to use, i just love it.",
            "good phone clear screen however no charge light as on previous models as well as no notification lights either",
            "disappointed so far as it keeps stopping on some apps and freezes when using the Internet.",
            "No quicker than S9+ which is disappointing and can't be on a call too long or gets too warm.",
            "great phone with awesome abilities. Just need 5g to roll out nationally quicker. Seems to have stalled a bit?",
            "I have had the s9 before and I find this model less of a jump as I'd expect. The camera is great which is why I kept with it. But the screen has cracked and it fell off the sofa on to carpet. Wasn't impressed by that at all. \nCertainly faster than he s9 and its still a great looking handset",
            "I love it the only thing I will say is you carnt have separate tones for different notifications it all has to be the same one",
            "Pictures are crystal clear and phone itself is fast and responsive..",
            "I'm now tied into a 3 year contract with a phone that is no better than my S9 was, I'm paying g contractually more for the base version and I'm extremely unhappy! The phone and its camera is but nothing special at all",
            "phone is fine the only problem is when locked it takes a lot to unlock it you can't just tap once",
            "The phone battery live is too bad!! No happy with this type of phone I think after payed this I will looking for another phone provide!! As i've to pay it for 2 years and change the phone 2 times a day maybe 3 or 4 after one year!",
            "The phone is good.  Only thing is you can't have a message tone for individuals, like their ringtone. I do miss that from the s7 edge.",
            "love my samsungs20 camera is amazing all round brilliant phone",
            "I had S20 for a few days so I'm still playing with all its features. I love the screen and how easy the S20 is to use. The pale blue colour is beautiful. The camera is fantastic.",
            "I love how a Samsung remembers  passwords etc. Easy to use and plenty of features",
            "love the quickness of the model, feels light and smooth. The performance is fast and  does exactly what I need and want",
            "I've had my S9 for 2 years and always been brilliant very durable I litterly knocked this S20 out of my hands and only fell a few inches and my phone screen has broken already.",
            "Great features size is perfect screen is amazing great camera great design",
            "So far impressive with a few niggles. Speed, camera, storage, battery and features are way better than my S9. The niggles are fingerprint sensor was better/more convenient on the back (my\n opinion) and switching off to unfreeze apps is a pain",
            "Previously I had an S9 and upgraded for the S20 and unfortunately was the worst idea ever. This phone is contantly freezing and you need to re start to phone. You send a like or delete an email and the message of what you have done continues on your screen while you doing other things for over a minute.",
            "The fingerprint sensor is erratic to say the least. Also the autocorrect puts words into messages where I don't want words, it freezes every now and again and to be honest doesn't seem to be any faster than my previous phone. Will be going for a different manufacturer next time.",
            "its compact and has a brilliant camera.  Have always had a Samsung galaxy and hate iPhones",
            "a really good phone to use. With very clear photos.",
            "Great phone very fast processor and fantastic camera",
            "I got the Samsung s20 as my new upgrade. My old phone was a 1plus. Which I foolishly gave away. The Samsung has a terrible signal, the apps freeze from time to time and the thumb print and face recognition barely work. The much cheaper 1plus was a far better phone. In my opinion.",
            "Great screen , nice size in your hand. All day battery life and 5G ready once its rolled  out in the UK.",
            "it's really cool and awesome I really like the camera,  the audio and the security",
            "excellent phone does everything thing it says it does and more",
            "Great design and really good performance. Would definitely recommend.",
            "nothink special.. the same like my old phone samsung galaxy s8;(  just 10% bettercamera works",
            "what isn't there to love had last 5/6 galaxy models and each 1 is better then the last , my favourite feature is and always has been camera and sound on the galaxy devices",
            "good camera quality and easy to use light weight perfect",
            "Awesome camera, massive storage and crystal clear video recording",
            "This phone keeps putting people on hold and muting people whilst I'm on the phone, it looses signal very quickly",
            "time by time back.of the phone get realy hot.and this make the phone really slow.",
            "Great all round phone definitely worth getting any S20 model",
            "So disappointed. I really wanted to like this phone but already sent it back! the camera is good but the phone overheats within 5 minutes of use. Terrible! Battery life is bad too. \nhave gone for the iphone 11. I am disappointed. First and last time with Samsung",
            "amazing phone love Samsung androids and this one looks the part. Feels very comfortable in hand with a good selection of cases that allow for wireless charging.\nBattery life very good so far no complaints very fair price.",
            "I love my s20 5g its so clear and the camera is amazing its so fast aswell.",
            "To be honest, it's not what I have been wanting for. Moving the volume button from the left to the right ain't feeling right. There isn't much difference base on the features. The only massive thing I have seen for improvement is. The design of the cameras.",
            "grrat features and best galaxy phone ive had only down fall is the battery life shortest life since the s7",
            "had my phone since April 18th not that impressed with it compared to my old Samsung so this s20 keeps freezing on me and is getting really annoying keep doing it",
            "Phone is perfect I am excited",
            "I upgraded from s9 to s20 and my wife from s8+ to s20+. Big mistake. The cameras were much better that the s20s. The battery life is very poor. They overheat fast and when they do the brightness goes to almost minimum no matter what settings you do. In video calls sound quality is bad. Fingerprint sensor is rubbish. And many other things. Only good thing about these phones is the display,on 120 hz it looks amazing. \nBad bad Samsung",
            "I have had worse mobile and mistake. This mobile is not suitable at all for home user or professionals. Its come with faulty USB cable, has a heavy wait and worse finger print in the screen. Camera is not what I was expecting. But just some thing different , not an ordinary or special. Disappointed",
            "Bought s20 on pre order. Everything works fine except de Google page. The phone freezes occasionally or the screen goes off when I search for a page.I am not feeling lucky at all.",
            "sounds like this website is faulty i couldn't buy anything after 4days \n\ncan someone help me to finaly buy it ?",
            "I love the features, camera is one of the best out there too ,however after a few weeks of owning this phone I've starting having issues with the camera focusing, and the phone keeps rebooting out of nowhere as much as 3-4 times a week. And the exynos chip just overheats way to quickly. Samsung please sort these issues out as soon as possible, if these issues persist I may have to switch to another device through another company, I don't seem to be the only one complaining about these issues",
            "I have had my Samsung S20 for 4 weeks now and absolutely love it. So clear and crisp.",
            "I always try to change my phone every year, this year I opted for the S20.\nOut of the box I wasn’t too happy, no little pin thingy to open the sim tray, only dual sim or one and a micro sd card. Two sims and an sd card would be nicer. Also no headphone jack socket, yes I have some Galaxy buds but I also have some excellent plug in ear phones.\nI’m now over these issues now, the stand out feature is the camera, this is my main reason for buying a phone. The three lenses are out standing, the video is excellent and the slow modes coupled with excellent editing suites is so mush better than the S10.\nI like the new flatter screen, the curves on the S10 made putting screen protectors on difficult, so now this is better. The fingerprint sensor is 10X better than the S10.\nOverall I’m very happy now I’ve had time to use the S20, as usual Samsung have done an outstanding job...\nOne thing, more to do with marketing, I’m not a pretty young thing as your advertising seems to think all Galaxy buyers are...",
            "I've had this phone a bit now, I have gone to the S20 from the s10+ and the battery was far better on the s10+ can't fault the phone as such,  maybe its because I've gone for the entry level S20. I just find it underwhelming. And made me think I should of stuck to the S10+.",
            "faster and brighter than any other Samsung. I absolutely love it! The camera feature is amazing. All the fast acting features mean I can't leave my S20 alone!",
            "Amazing phone with a ton of features. I have the s20+. Camera is amazing and the 30x zoom is great and sufficient for everyday use. Handles downloads, streaming and gaming at ease as well",
            "had this on upgrade and so happy with the new galaxy S20",
            "I got the S20 2 weeks ago after having an S8 for 3 and half years. It is a marked improvement to the S8 and when I swapped the phone over found the transition easy. The camera is amazing and I just need to work out how to use it better. The phone has a great feel but just like the S8 I find it slippery in the hand.  I find the size ideal for me with easy access to the apps. The design is great but the camera lenses stick out the back of the phone which personally i do not like. I would have given 5 stars but the lenses and slipperyness are 2 points I think need to be considered on the next version.",
            "whilst the s20 has a huge 64mp camera it's slow and awkward to use especially taking photos of receipts and labels e.g. for expenses. I've not seen any real world performance improvement over my s9+. \nWhen scaling the 64mp pics and videos on my laptop the actual image quality and pixel refinement are poor. Colours are not as natural as the s9+.\nIf you're switching from a low end phone the s20 is a good enough jump but not if you have already invested in a good quality handset. \nCall quality, text reliability is no different. \nThe lack of a rear facing fingerprint scanner is a shockingly poor miss and massively reduces the handling ease if the phone. Ie hold on left hand unlock with left index finger use right hand for front screen. \nVoice activated features are unreliable.\nSamsung to can do better at this price point.",
            "I got this phone weeks ago it is brilliant  well done Samsung.",
            "don't get wrong the phone is amazing I can't fault it,however I'm kicking myself now because I should have gone with the s20 plus.as I've big hands and this is to small.ive given it a couple of weeks to try and adapt but I can't and now I'm stuck with it as my 14 exchange period has expired",
            "So, still getting used to it after the S9\nHow to turn it off?? seems to want to stay on all the time\nCharges easily\nLots and lots of finger work to exit apps",
            "wish I'd switched yo the iPhone. Battery life is poor and the signal on this is terrible compared to my s9.  Only had it a week so disappointed with it.",
            "I came from a iPhone l was surprised how good the Samsung s20 is. Fits in my pocket. Good camera and like the colours it comes in",
            "The simple and seamless transfer from S8 to S20 with all data etc was the easiest yet. Function brilliant and I'm sure I'm only scratching the surface. Only niggle is that when it shows 5G but on the periphery signal wise, it does buffer. Thought that was a thing of the past....",
            "I used the S20 for about 2 weeks and what an impressive bit of kit! You have all the hardware to keep you going fast with more then enough RAM to keep everything open without slowing you down. The screen is a perfect size with Samsung's very impressive OLED UHD display and the 120hz makes everything so smooth! The 3 cameras on the back are a great addition taking incredible pictures with an impressive zoom! I used the S20 all day replying to emails n texts, using the camera and watching YouTube and it really does last all day!! All in all a perfect phone for the day to day and I would highly recommend!",
            "The Samsung s20 is the best phone I've ever owned.",
            "Had the phone  week or so. Not completely  sold on it. Lack of he'd phone socket and bottom switch are most annoying. Good memory and camera but battery runs down quickly. I do not think it is worth the th money.",
            "Has the S20 5G for about a week now and am loving it. Pretty similar to the S9 but the updated fingerprint sensor on the front is much better and having all the buttons on one side it good.",
            "I bought the Samsung S20 5G a couple of weeks ago. Although the phone itself is pretty good, the camera is very disappointing. The selfie camera smooths out the skin and blurs it even when the beauty mode is turned off - this makes all your pictures look artificial and airbrushed. I just want a camera that can take a natural picture - is that too much to ask for? Can't say that the back camera is much better either. Not worth the money I paid for this phone as the front camera in particular is unusable!",
            "Coming from the Galaxy Note 10 which is another great Galaxy device, I was surprised  by how good is the S20. \n\nI love the pocket friendly design and impressive screen. Also, the availability of SD card slot is an upgrade over the Note 10.",
            "brilliant phone by Samsung once again always had the galaxy right from the S2 the only thing I'm not sure of is the volume buttons on the right instead of the left.",
            "I've been using OnePlus phones for years now and I decided I wanted a change and omg I'm so glad I did. The Samsung galaxy S20 is simply incredible. That's it."
