If you’re going to use it for quite a few tasks you’ll have to charge it everyday. I went for purple colour, which is more lilac than purple. It’s almost off lilac.",

Expensive but so are all smartphone now, and you really do get what you pay for",

            "This is my second iPhone 11 as previously owned it in purple. Most definitely the best model as of yet owing to the wide camera angle option and the faster chip/processing. Battery life is something Apple has previously lacked on but the iPhone 11 lasts so much longer and this is a big feature which most consider when upgrading.",
            "I love this phone!! The camera quality is brilliant takes the best photos!! Definitely worth it!!",
            "Great phone with great features ..happy with the product",

            "iPhone 11 truly has the features of the 21 century. It’s screen is wide enough for the eyes. I can hardly find any fault with it.  It’s security feature of eye recognition or indeed using the conversational keying in password is so adorable.",
            "So easy to set up . Just needed to pair it up with my old phone.   Ordered on line to collect next day in store .",
            "Hadn’t purchased a new phone for 7 years until my old one broke. The iPhone 11 is exceptionally better than my old phone - the camera is great, the battery is great and it looks great too!",
            "The Iphone 11 is to me just another Iphone.\nI bought it as it’s wise to keep up. \nMost of the features are no different to my iphone 8 plus. It takes great photos just like the 8 plus, it answers calls, sends texts and email just like the 8 plus. The stand out feature the longer battery life is a plus. The retina screen I can’t see much difference. If you have an 8 plus, X is it worth upgrading? Only you can decide.",
            "It's IPhone and Iphone is the best. I recommend it",
            "Thank you Argos for fast delivery you are best!!",

            "Best iPhone I’ve had by far. Nice size to fit in my hand (previously had 8 plus), screen is just the right size, bigger than the 8plus. Love the face recognition - saves faffing about with the finger print log in which was temperamental. Decided on the red colour and it’s gorgeous. Camera is fab even for selfies as it’s 12mp both ways. Runs really fast and battery lasts forever. Love it!",
            "I purchased the iPhone in Argos and I am very pleased with it. Was able to transfer everything over from my iPhone6 with no problem. It has a number of features the older model didn’t have. Easy to use with a crystal clear display and also a brilliant camera! Really happy with my purchase.",
            "My previous iPhone 8 broke leaving me without a phone so I took the plunge for the iPhone 11. The difference in screen size and cameras are worth the change alone!\n\nSimilar price to elsewhere but easiest to access at short notice.",

            "After 10 years spent with different smartphone brand I just fell in love with iPhone 11. Never been fan of iPhone because of price. But found out my favourite brand is this time a little more expensive. I did hesitate but second day I fell in love. Definitely recommend!!!\nOnly one little minus - third day I scratched my screen - worse scratch than on my 2 years old smartphone which never been used with screen protector or flip case. So don't wait and buy a screen protector at the same time.",
            "bought for my daughter as an upgrade she loves it she's happy so I am happy",

            "I got 128GB thinking I’ve sorted my storage problems but I’m still getting messages that I’ve run out of storage space and this is with additional 50GB which I pay monthly as extra.  I think It’s a rip off. Not very happy for an expensive phone like this.",
            "Phone is great, battery life is the best I have had from an apple phone. With using my argos card spreading the cost is going to work out so much better than a contract. Picked up fine, very efficient especially given the disruption in the world at the moment!",

            "It does as its meant to, and as it should. The price is overly expensive & I was only able to afford it due to added vouchers and cashbacks, otherwise I wouldn’t have. It’s not entirely different to my iPhone 6S but I have yet to discover more. In great honesty I don’t think any phone is worth that much money however it has impressive features & the fact that it should last me for a good few years and knowing it’s one of the latest ones means I shouldn’t have to think of a new phone for a while!",
            "Phon is very nice. And delivery is fast. I love Argos.",

            "This is a good upgrade on previous iterations of the phone, particularly if you're upgrading from a 6 or 7 like I was. The camera is significantly better for capturing daytime photos - but still not as good as a Samsung's at night.\n\nMy only other complaint would be that Apple still haven't resolved the battery issue - my phone is flat by the end of the day, making it necessary to carry a power bank if you're planning on being out later after work.",

Beautiful to hold, easy to use and the best camera out there (in my opinion)- this does not feel basic in the slightest. I am extremely happy and wouldn’t ‘upgrade’ to the pro - doesn’t really seem worth it. \nRecommended.",

            "I wasn't 100% sure I was going to like this phone due to the odd looking camera & also wasn't sure about the white colour. However, I'm glad I went ahead. The camera does look a bit weird but to be honest like most people I spend 99% of my time looking at the other side so it doesn't really matter. It also looks great in white. The phone itself is fast (compared to my iPhone 7) & the battery life is brilliant. Overall I'm very pleased, as ever with Apple products tho, the price is sky high!",

            "I needed an upgrade. It is bigger than my 6s but great screen clarity. It is cheaper to buy the handset than get it on a contract so this was a good choice. The increased memory ability is also a good upgrade. I love the colour and the Face ID option. Easy to order and collect from the store.",
            "A great upgrade and a great phone.",
            "This phone has a great colour selection and ultra long battery life. It stores all of your data and wouldn’t change a thing about it. Fantastic speed and perfect size!",

            "One of the best features of iPhone 11 is the battery life. The battery last for nearly 2 days without charging. No more power bank or carrying chargers around. Also the camera is as sharp as razor, the picture comes out beautiful. The night mode camera? You can’t just stop loving it. It’s amazing.\nI have been using Apple since iPhone 5 and this is the by far the best by miles. You have to feel it to love it. I would recommend it 100%",
