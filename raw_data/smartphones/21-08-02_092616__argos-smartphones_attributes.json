So far the Pixel 4a with 5G hasn't disappointed. Excellent camera which is a key thing for me. It's night mode allows for excellent low light photos. Daylight has superb quality as does the video. I wish there was a way to turn off the Google bar at the top of the home screen and the suggested news when you swipe left.",
            "Excellent display, cameras, battery life and stereo speakers.Lovely design and the ultra wide angle camera is a welcome addition.",
            "Gorgeous looking phone, lightning fast for daily use, and has the benefits of being Google's own Android handset. No bloatware. Comes with a ton of nice wallpapers, some of which fit the pinhole cleverly into the artwork. Charges quick. Amazing camera (with Night Sight). Great value and will definitely stay with Google from now own. I love it!",
            "Excellent very impressed, highly recommend ,alot of phone for the money,",
            "It's really good. It has a good screen, good camera and I like that they were able to make a smaller phone than others on the market.",
            "I have been the laughing stock of my family and friends for not having a good phone but this has brought me right upto date. Everything I need, and more is in this phone and I will now have to find a new way to get laughs. Great features, camera and display. My only grumble was having to buy a car charger as it didn't have a standard compatible lead for the car or information regarding USB Types and adaptors. It took awhile finding the right one due to lack of information. Set up was very easy and it did come with a lead to transfer my info from my old phone. Would recommend without hesitation.",
            "I am very happy with my new phone Pixel 4a, it was so easy to transfer all the data and photos from my old phone to the new one. The Pixel 4a is great value for money compared other well know phones and is just as good if not better. Very Happy",
            "Very pleased with new phone, small size, good battery, excellent camera, better screen. Google's guidance on the 4a phone was very useful.",
            "Absolutely love my phone easy to use and everything I need , just the right size.",
            "Good phone, easy to use and setup and nice size.Battery doesn't last as long as some phones, but easily sees me through the day.",
            "The phone is spot on, went from a iPhone 11pro to this phone, and to me it's better, simple, but does everything well, I love it!",
            "Very pleased with this phone, easy to use and better battery life is better than I phone.",
            "For several years I've chosen Motorola Moto G phones as the best budget Android phone, with the cleanest version of the Android experience. This time I opted to try the Pixel approach and I'm glad I did.Great size, super responsive, great camera. There's not much that this does that that many other phones do, but at this price few do it so well. If you're a fan of Android and don't want fluff to get in the way, this is the phone for you.I'm a Pixel convert.",
            "Absolutely love my new phone. Easy to use for an oldie like me. Lots of great features and all my data from old phone was easy to recover. Lots more storage too.",
            "The phone has serious heating issues . I have not seen any other phone heating as much on a video call. I am not a gamee so havnt tried it while gaming but my guess is itll heat up significantly, otherwise the phone feels good",
            "Is a very adaptable phone to use am impressed there were a few surprises with freedom of entry by sites I didn't want to be in touch with but the virus cleaning facilities have cleaned them up was unsure how they got in",
            "Recently upgraded from a Samsung S10e and I find this phone much better in a lot of ways.",
            "A very good purchase to say the least. More than I expected.",
            "A very good purchase to say the least. More than I expected.",
            "This has been the hardest phone to get used to iv ever had. All sorted now but will go back to a Samsung next time. There was Avery limited stock in the shop when I called in and wanted as near to an A40 as possible. It's the quickest iv been in and out of an EE shop when upgrading due to covid restrictions",
            "A nightmare to use. Not sure why they have removed home buttons. I will get rid of this phone asap.",
            "Great value. Easy to set-up. Has everything I need.",
            "Rating a phone this highly is not something I expected to be doing, but having owned phone from other manufacturers, what the Pixel 4a offers for its price is incredible. Transferring my data from a previous non Pixel phone was very simple.I love the pixel UI, the built in guides when you use the phone for the first time is beautifully designed. The camera is outstanding. If a premium phone is something you cannot afford, I highly recommend giving this phone consideration. Happy customer.",
            "I really like the phone, I honestly think its one of the best phones out there with an incredible price as well. However the two things I would like to change about the phone is, 1. Have a one handed mode, I used to have a redmi note 7 and it had a one hande mode which was really handy as I normally use a phone with one hand and 2. a change of emojis. Honestly hate them so go and use the android ones or maybe have a design change?",
            "Didn't want an phone complicated by manufacturers need to overlay their own software over already excellent android software. THis phone is pure android as it should be and is a delight to use. The camera is the best I have used on any phone.",
            "Quick, sleek and all you need!Stock android and very smooth.Compact phone perfect for your pocket",
            "I was a Samsung acolyte for many years. Got a Pixel 4A last week and I have been blown away at how good it is.It's a phone that learns how you use it and adapts itself to give you a better user experience.Sounds mental, and it is. But trust me this phone is the best I've had.",
            "The phone is lovely, sensible size, full of features and works well. The only problem is that it is packed with embedded Google features that I don't want, don't like and don't need snooping on my every move. Can't find a way to escape most of them so Off Grid this phone certainly isn't and nor will you be. I guess we are used to being watched wherever we go nowadays but this phone takes it to extremes. I guess it's a bit like living in China with Big Brother monitoring your every move. Sad.",
            "Always had android phones and for me this is the best I've had. Easy to use, loads of storage ( 128GB) so I can put all my apps on and still have a large amount of storage left. The camera is amazing, still learning about all the fab stuff it can do. And this little bundle of joy connects to all my other Google tech which is great, even my chrome book. I'm one happy Google pixel 4a customer",
            "Thought it might be a step back from a flagship phone, but it's absolutely superb just a good device, well executed, exactly what I need.",
            "Easy to use, good quality camera, and a lot faster than my previous phone, an old LG android. Highly recommend",
            "I purchase this phone as an upgrade from my Huawei p30 lite, however within 48 hours I had returned to my old handset. Nothing on the phone is intuitive - there is no silent mode, do not disturb is for either everything or nothing, navigating out of apps is almost impossible without a back button, and everything bottlenecks with the intrusion of Google accounts linking constantly across apps. The hardware may measure up, but the software is found wanting...",
            "I've only had one previous Pixel, the original and it served me well until the  battery started to show its age. I considered the 4a, but a tight budget had me buy something else and it was a good phone, if too large, but where it couldn't match my old Pixel was the camera (and it was almost too heavy for my gimbal). A turn of fortunes and I jumped at the 4a 5G. While it might not feel as 'premium' as my old one, there's little doubt that this is an upgrade. The jump from Android 10 to 12 beta3 was smooth enough and the new tricks are pleasing and useful.Naturally the cameras are fantastic. I can't wait to start filming some live gigs with it soon. I record my audio separately, but this seemed to do a good job with my hi-fi cranked up, so clean sound will make it easier to sync with.It's good to be packing a Pixel again.",
            "It is a great little phone. Compact but not too small, fast, responsive, the camera is very good. Its less customisable than previous phones and I wasn't keen on the new gesture interface at first, but I now prefer it to my old phone and have changed my work phone to match. The dual speakers are really good too. The only negative is battery is a tad small for me. I can still make it through a day, but my last couple of phones had nearly double the battery size, the trade off was they were slower, heavier and the screens weren't as tough.",
            "Good basic smart phone but short of a few items that leave it a little short of other makes",
            "Pros: Compact, fast and smooth interface, clean android 11 with no bloat-ware, awesome camera, and a headphone jack, really nice OLED screen which is great for YouTube/ Netflix etc, slim build which feels good in the hand, battery lasts all day and the charging speed is incredibleCons: plastic build, not so good when it comes to gaming, slightly outdated chipset although plenty fast for everyday tasks,video quality isn't quite as good as photo quality but it is still good.All in all a high quality phone for the price, you get everything you need, and no more. It's fast, has a great camera and all day battery with garunteed updates from a highly acclaimed company. Strongly recommend.",
            "Like my new phone , excellent,works well does everything I want a phone to do.",
            "You can't go wrong at this price point. Transferring from old phone was faultless. Camera is excellent. Does everything I need as an average user. Should be good for a years to come.",
            "I love this phone a brilliant camera and easy to ise",
            "Good value for money. Does all I want from a mobile device",
            "Work's well and robust at a sensible price what more could you want.",
            "Phone is good for the price, it has a bigger battery then the iPhone 12 yet it is somehow 1/5 of its price. Can't explain enough how much of a good price this phone is",
            "I always wanted compact design phone which is east to pocket and handle This one is just that",
            "Great phone for the money. Brilliant camera and great android experience",
            "Excellent size, build, and materials. Just needs to be water resistant (not proof) like other budget mobiles. Software side is awesome, great battery life once it gets use to your usage and the camera is the best. Only wish they had a shortcut toggle on lock screen for the torch and you could use the space bar to scroll through text input, just like iPhone. Other than that much better than iPhone imo. Enjoy all!",
            "Really impressed with the Google Pixel 4A. Would definitely recommend!",
            "Lovely phone with an excellent camera, does everything well.",
            "Screen cracked on the first day. If it is that delicate it should come with a basic case.Camera is really good and phone works like a smart phone. Even with a cracked screen it feels like a slight upgrade from my 5 year old Samsung with an uncracked screen.",
            "Never going back to Samsung's, Huawei's or iPhones really liking my Google phone wish I would of got one sooner",
            "Excellent in every way except battery life disappointing. Camera superb.",
            "It's good in many way's, only not sure how to screenshot at the moment",
            "First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to the high storage capacity, security functions such as fingerprint scanner, which works amazingly well and not only that but the quality of the camera is wonderful. Another thing that I like about the phone is that its quite light and easily fits into your pocket comfortably making it easy to travel with and the screen has a great display and is very responsive and doesn't lag like previous phones I've had and not only that but it's not difficult to use and I also believe it's very user-friendly.Finally I would conclude, that this is a very affordable phone, that is the best on the market in it's price range and is suitable for either Techies and none Techies a like.",
            "Fabulous phone at a fraction of the cost of my previous one. So easy to set up and use.",
            "Great, affordable, has massive memory, google thankyou ! Just the job, phone handles 365 office apps, which load quickly, clear sensitive screen, easy to navigate functions. very pleased with this entry level phone, why pay more.. when this phone has more.",
            "My new phone doesn't have an intuitive User Interface, lots if tricky swipes to learn and they are not always recognised by the OS.The product is good, but more consideration needed for users.",
            "Quite easy to use once you get used to the swiping. Camera is great. If you have had a Samsung in past or other Android this is a good switch and you won't be disappointed.",
            "The only down side is that it's not wireless ly chargeable.",
            "Generally very happy with the phone but battery life is a slight concern and I'm not sure the camera is as great as most reviews say, I am finding quite a few artefacts even without using the digital zoom.",
            "Upgraded from a 3a XL, really miss the back button at the bottom of the screen. As well as the swipe up function to see different running apps. The 4a has two functions that clash when you swipe up and isn't good usability",
            "Great phone,just as good as a Samsung , can't believe how good and easy it is to use.",
            "Excellent phone so far . Great size and weight.! Would recommend to anyone.",
            "I got this to replace a 3 year old Samsung J3, so nothing fancy. Yet my old, slow J3 still outperforms this phone with the exception of the camera.I can not get the phone to ring or alert me when sound and/vibrate is on, s keep missing calls. Videos usually crash after about 90 seconds. There are very few camera functions, although the average image capture is pretty good. There is no option for another image folder, only google photos, and I don't want all my pictures automatically updated to a cloud. Wish I'd never bought it.",
            "Very impressed so far with phones speed and features.",
            "I was a bit terrified to change my phone because i am not very technically minded. But it is fantastically easy to use. The camera is unbelievably good. The only thing is that its a bit small but its fine for me. I can enlarge the font so no problem.",
            "Excellent small handset with the advantage of having easy links to my Google account.",
            "Great phone at a great price, can't fault it. Looks good and works even better",
            "Really happy I chose the pixel 4 5gIts fast, has clear screen, no bloatware and the camera is brilliant.  I am also surprised by the ai features that make life with phone better.Th",
            "Can't fault this phone at all so far, first Pixel I have owned...don't think I'd ever look elsewhere for a phone again. Stunning camera, it just doesn't take bad photos. Camera was important to me with a 9 month old I want to capture lots of memories and this phone won't disappoint. Battery life is stunning, nearly 48 hours for me! All round use is fast and fluid. Nothing negative to report! Thanks Google I am now officially Team Pixel!",
            "Nice sleek phone, crisp camera good functions also practical apps via Google for work and leisure.  Very impressive good useful phone.",
            "I love the ease if use for this phone. Battery life is good. The camera is amazing especially the night sight. Highly recommended",
            "Had a few Google pixels over the years right back to the Nexus 4 this one is by far the best I've ever owned. Love the size small phone but still 5.8\" screen. The features are fantastic and the camera is amazing. The phone is a joy to use. It's very nippy and more than enough for most people's needs. Get one!!",
            "This is my second Google pixel phone, even better than the last.",
            "Enjoying my Pixel 4a very much, particularly the quality of photos it takes. Also the sound quality that comes out of such a small device, without headphones, is amazing.",
            "Absolutely delighted with this phone. Had first Gen Pixel for about four years now and decided it was time for an upgrade. For the price this is a brilliant phone. The step up in specs, features and performance are excellent. I've had the phone two weeks now and haven't found a thing that disappointed or gave me regret about the upgrade. Amazing phone, great price. If you're considering upgrade from earlier Gen Pixel but don't want to pay top cost for the pixel 5 then this is the option for you.",
            "I've only had this phone for a few days but I am really enjoying it so far. Compared to my old phone, it's way faster and the camera is phenomenal. Would recommend to anyone wanting to try out a Google phone.",
            "Excellent phone at good price changed back to Android from I phone",
            "I am a long time Iphone user so the move to a Google Pixel 4a has been a challenging one for me personally. However I can honestly say I am enjoying the phone, it has the following list of pros that I am enjoying most:The camera is unreal, so good and a lot of features I wouldnt expectThe speed is rapid, I have no lingering between apps or performance of high CPU demanding apps including games that need decent graphicsThe phone is configurable to my needs, it has some very good intuition that if you allow it to get to know your use then it shapes how and what it does for you to match 5g compatible which is useful (when i find a signal) Slightly smaller than the XR which is a good thing IMOThe way that the OS groups the apps is far more aesthetically easy to view and navigate than the IOS equivalent. All in all I am liking the phone and although I miss the XR it is becoming something I miss less and less :)",
            "Google have produced a quality product at a reasonable cost giving me all the features I need without being complicated.",
            "Simple small unit that does the key things well and a lot more beside. Easy set up and no bloat ware.",
            "Compact, really nice feel. Free from any bloat, very clean. Camera software is second to none. Phone is far more than the sum of its specs, Google have thought a lot about how to make the 4a a pleasure to use.",
            "Not a bad phone but have constant problem's with it not recognising the SIM card and have to turn off several times a day",
            "Really good value for money. Really happy with the phone and its camera is outstanding. I can play games as well. But a little bit downside is it's processer. 6 GB and 128 GB storage is good and unlimited google photos storage.",
            "I was treated very well by the young lady in store.She  and advised me and was very confident.",
            "Great phone considering the money I paid. Will always go for any phone that gets first updates, no bloatware etc. And this has not disappointed. Little smaller than I'm used to but fidelity makes up for that. Would recommend to anyone",
            "This is a very decent budget device everything works fast and snappy. I would say camera is the strongest asset here didn't found anything wrong yeat. Battery file is good to.",
            "Takes some getting used to since it operates differently from my last phone( Samsung galaxy)I'm not used to not having a back button with everything now controlled by swiping.A very sleek phone!",
            "Thoroughly brilliant phone. Good hardware, simple design. Outstanding camera. Builds on the success of the 3a and improves it with its unibody polycarbon body and small form factor.My favourite Google phone since the Nexus 4.",
            "Very happy with this phone. Fast and efficient and battery seems to last for quite some time, better than my old phone. A good priced phone, why pay more! Does everything I want",
            "This is a cheap but well featured phone.Easy to setup and transfer from previous phone.Not top end specifications but good enough for most people.",
            "Generally a decent phone, not weighed down with lots of \"firmware\" that will never be used. Battery life much better than some reviews would have you believe. However, like most so called smart phones, the range of options and layers of setting limits the users ability to fine tune the way the phone interacts - too many choices to navigate",
            "Buttery life could have been better, e-sim not enabled in UK.so I can use only single SIM, no wireless charging",
            "I like a smaller mobile and most important the latest  security updates, this you get with the pixel range.On top of that a great camera",
            "What can I say! A great phone for a great price! .",
            "Putting simply ..why didn't I get a pixel earlier these phones are astonishing and the camera quality especially the astrophotography is incredible!",
            "The 4a is great with a couple of exceptions. The size is perfect for me and I like it's slim profile. What is taking a bit of getting used to however is the swipe to go back function. In apps where you swipe for a feature I keep finding myself back on the homepage. I'm sure I'll get used to it but it's a bit annoying just now. Likewise when I want to minimise the page I keep getting the assistant. I can probably turn that off though and will look at doing that. Overall though I highly recommend this phone.",
            "Google pixel 4a phone is just awesome. .....,........................................................",
            "The phone is good, but seems a downgrade on my nearly 3 year old pixel 3xl. Freezes a tad, if only for a second. Doesn't feel as premium too. It's early days, see how I feel after a month or two.Also, the gestures are weird. I prefer the two button layout and the fast switching of the two most recently opened tabs!Thanks",
            "Had to get a new phone in a rush and this is perfect. Excellent battery life, very fast, clear. I love the gestures to move between screens. Very intuitive. Only gripes, it's a bit small and can be tricky to find apps. Great spec for the price. Recommended",
            "What more do you need, telephoto lens maybe? Otherwise, a smooth phone, compact and fast.",
            "Does a lot, who needs more, is there more?? It set up very easily so was in use in minutes.",
            "I purchased for sim only after reading all the positive reviews and very happy with this mobile! Great camera, lots of storage space and easy to use.",
            "A very good phone that's cheap and does all the stuff modern phones can do.",
            "Much better value for money than any apple phone!!",
            "Best phone I've had ever.It lasts long, functions harder and displays swimmingly.More than enough",
            "Brilliant phone brilliant camera and dual speakers sound better than pixel 5 and brilliant price hopefully will get pixel 6 pro",
            "Great display. Android runs silky smooth. And the camera is of course amazing. Phone feels perfect in the hand. And terrific value for money. I used to use a flagship phone costing more than twice as much but now much prefer this.",
            "Brilliant screen high resolutionCompact strong design Speedy user interface and fast at all tasks you throw at your device gets things done with ease Battery is brilliant Best all round phone for everyday life it will get you through your day simply and easy no hassle just gets the work done. Cameras are high quality best detailed camera with colours accurately showing on the OLED display best for photo sharing to all kinds of social media platforms. The speakers are the best I've heard on a phone extremely loud and bass is deep sounds like a high quality 2 dual speaker system in a compact design phone. Choose Google. Many thanks",
            "Great phone and great battery life. Not had chance to try the 5g yet though.",
            "Loving my new 4a. Slim and elegant. Only small issue is that the brush moves from the corner confuses my games in landscape orientation. In a card game you have to be careful how you play the cards at either end of the hand.",
            "clear and responsive software without any duplicate or uneeded apps from manufacturers, 5G connection fast, excellent camera, best audio and video drivers on android",
            "i just got this for my birthday, its great! Great camera, excellent screen, and minimal packaging.",

            "I have had all the pixel phones and I absolutely love them I would never go back to Samsung and apple and iPhone don't even exist because I can't stand them. The pixel phones are smart fast and do everything perfectly simply and they are so simple and work excellently.",
            "Absolutely amazing, lightweight and robust, it's also quick and the image is sharp as anything.  Bought because I was on a budget and needed a new phone, but I have not been disappointed at all, think I will stick to Google phones from now on if they continue to be this good",
            "Cool phone ,great photos,easy to use , light in hand",
            "Small, lightweight and well designed. Does everything I need in a smartphone with the bonus of free image back up on the cloud.",
            "Absolutely love this mobile it's easy to navigate and use the memory and storage on this device is brilliant it does everything that I need it to do. Highly recommended this phone to everyone",
            "My primary interest was a good camera, I sent back a Poco F3 for the terrible camera, saw review sample images of the Pixel 4a and was blown away, couldn't believe they were taken on a phone. Had my Pixel 4a a week now, the camera really is amazing, photos look crisp and detailed  with wonderful colours, contrast, dynamic rance and point and shoot simplicity. I used slrs for years but I had to edit every slr image not so with the 4a, every photo perfect exposure, you don't even usually need to tap to focus unless you want to photos just look amazing. Also use 4a for stadia cloud gaming and native games like asphalt 9 run perfectly too. Phone is quite small but I like that, if I had to point out any weak points, ringtone not very loud, screen not very bright, battery just adequate but left with 20-30% at end of day. The cpu is fast enough, phone is very responsive, 128 gb storage, it's a great phone especially the camera, highly recommended.",
            "Really easy to use with lots of useful functions. I primarily got this phone for its quality camera and it definitely doesn't disappoint. The mic is also great. I love it.",
            "Got the newer 4a which is smaller than my last 4a. Everything has changed and I'm finding it very frustrating to use.Also too sensitive and does things by accident. I want my old one back!!!",
            "I recently had a google pixel 4a from having iphone all my life and it's so much better for everything, the battery life and the the phone to use it's brilliant for me, takes a little she to get used to where everything is compared to the iPhone but I prefer it so much more, definitely recommend.",
            "A good value for money 5g phone with a great camera and pure android with the benefits of regular updates to OS and security with no unnecessary added bloatware.Obviously you could spend a lot more for a fancy looking phone with better specs on paper...BUT, do you actually need to? I suspect this phone is absolutely all the phone most people really need.Certainly works for me... recommended.",
            "Absolutely love this phone. Have had Samsung galaxy's for many years now. But decided to have a change after a week of looking around and asking friends, the Google Pixel 4a with 5g was highly recommend. Easy phone to use and it's beautiful. Would definitely recommend getting one.",
            "Great camera, great display, good to have a 3.5mm jack socket. It would be good to have an expandable memory, though. I've not had this phone for long, but so far so good.",
            "Continues the pixel line in being an excellent phone with great features. Camera is very good despite the hardware being a year or so old. I love the latest version of Android and it's usability.",
            "Screen broke first time it fell out my pocket after having it not even for 9 hours, it's completely broken and now I'm using my old phone again.",
            "Compact, fast, loads of memory space, excellent camera, well pleased.",
            "Decent small phone for the price. Large storage memory which is excellent for all the app downloads nowadays. Battery life decent too.  Reasonable camera pixel quality. One disappointment is it does not have a USB connector for charging with on the charger cable, both ends are the same C connectors?",
            "Premium phone with a 3.5mm headphone port. Camera is one of the best things about the phone.",
            "I got the pixel 4a when I upgraded from the 3a. I expected a better version but the 3a is a far better phone. The 4a battery lasts half the time as the 3a and the phone gets very hot very quickly when in use. Wish I'd kept the 3a",
            "Third pixel I have owned and doesn't disappoint, best yet: fast, clean and compact. Amazing vfm.",
            "I find this easy to use and easy to find help to do so",
            "Switched from a Moto G9 Plus to be sure of getting upgrades. Screen is smaller but just big enough. Nice pocket size.Battery is smaller but easily lasts all day especially if I pop in the car and plug it in for Android Auto. Android Auto seems better since it does not need an unlock. Camera app is the best thing since it is in plain English instead of meaningless icons. I had the Moto for 9 months without realising that the lens could do text recognition.Speakers are better than the Motorola and the WiFi speed on a poor connection seems to be better.Seems to have caller id built-in where I had to use an annoying app on the Motorola.",
            "The phone is excellent ,and just the size I wanted for single handed use, just got to get used to the changes of the Android 11 over my previous A9.",
            "This is the best google Pixel l have had . I am playing with it to learn how to get the best out of it. Having a jack to use earphones is great. The camera is outstanding so good. I was able to use google maps in areas that were very remote and it is so light. Very pleased with this purchase.",
            "I've had the pixel 4 a for a little while now. I like the stock android experience and I am getting used to the smaller 5.8\" screen size as it's smaller than my last phone. It fits in my pocket nicely, the stereo speakers are a nice touch too. A few things I would have liked to have been better are the size of the battery, the camera is good, very good at times but I don't like the waiting for the software to sharpen the image as it goes from sharp to fuzzy back to sharp again. Also the screen doesn't seem to get too bright and it's not the sharpest OLED screen I've owned. Other than these things I am willing to see how this phone goes especially with android 12 coming soon.",
            "Not happy at all with phone. Takes lot of getting used to. Camera could be better. If you're going from IPhone to this to you will struggle",
            "This phone is amazing as it has a great camera lots of cool camera setting and is so easy to use.",
            "All round brilliant phone. Love not having a home button. The only negative for me is that it doesn't support wireless charging. If you're not worried about this then definitely consider buying one.",
            "Great phone. My last phone was a 3 year old flagship model and I'm not intesterested in the latest features (or prices!) on the latest flagships, so I thought I would 'settle' with the Pixel 4a. However, this is far from settling.So far the phone feels like a real step up. It is fluid to use, has a great camera, and battery life looks like it will do a couple of days.Overall a great product I would recommend.",
            "Fantastic phone, decent sized screen, great memory at 128gb, quality camera, simplistic OS and UI. I have upgraded from Google Pixel 3XL and although there isn't massive improvements there are enough to be noticeable. Fantastic phone.",
            "Use to be an iPhone lover and then when the Samsung S7 Edge came out I then stuck with them for a while and bought the Note 8. I then purchased the OnePlus 7T second hand and loved it but battery life became an issue. Sick of flagship phones now and prefer mid-range phones and rather use the extra cash for other thing's.I've heard of the Google Pixel but knew no one with this kind of phone. After looking at the reviews I purchased a brand new Pixel 4a 5g and the price was extremely competitive. Absolutely love it and very minimalistic in style. It took for ever to sync everything to the Pixel but it was so worth the wait. I'm also using Google Pay now. Should have done this years ago! I was really concerned that I would miss out on the 90htz refresh rate which I had on the OnePlus and haven't noticed the difference. I cannot praise this phone enough and I'll be sticking with Google Pixel for quite sometime. Up to date software updates etc....bonus!Love it, Loving life!",
            "Very pleased with my purchase. Having decided to change from an iPhone I was a little apprehensive but everything worked out well. The only minor issue was I was unable to transfer my WhatsApp messages. I found the phone easy to navigate and soon got used to it.",

            "Fantastic phone for the price. Switched from the Galaxy S10 and the Pixel 4a is a worthy replacement. Flagship quality at 1/3 of the flagship price.",
            "Like the phone, ideal size. I wish the always on lockscreen would allow always on when notification land as an option other than just off or on.",
            "Went for this version over 4g because of the battery improvement.   This battery lasts well over a day even with heavy use, so I think it was a good decision.  I've turned off 5g because I don't have a package with this included.  Phone operates in a very premium way.  Love the lack of bloatware.   Only downside so far is that android 11 has knocked off my WiFi.  Really annoying and have struggled to get a solution through Google.",
            "Good budget phone with above average camera and smooth running os. Simplistic but attractive design and for a 2020 phone actually manageable screen size. Love it and would recommend and buy again if given reason.",

            "good phone with a great camera and very good battery life",
            "I've had this phone for well over a week now. For a more budget phone this performs as well as any phone I've had, if not better. Took some getting use to the different controls I was familiar too , but I really like how intuitive it is. Camera is awesome. Battery life is spot on- it easily lasts the day with moderate use.",
            "I am still learning how to use the phone, but so far it is brilliant",
            "I like it. Can confirm that it's good, for a good price.",
            "Overall very good. Issues with side swipes when playing games and with the closing of apps. Both very tricky and annoying.",
            "... better than my last phone, probably not as good as my next phone...battery life is average to good, not A-mazing though.Lots of nifty features which make life easier.Highly recommended as a mid range mid budget device.4 out of 5",
            "This is my 2nd Pixel and I think it's perfect for what I need. Had it a week now and the only fault, all be it a minor one is the battery. It does the day but with waze or apple music it canes the battery. I understand this will improve as the phone adapts to my usage but a bigger battery would have been ideal. The phone works great and looks smart AF. I like a simple looking phone so this is bang on what I like.",
            "Smart, snappy, very fast, great snap shooter .. love it",
            "Does what I need decent battery and apps    , easy to use single handed",
            "Brilliant phone, I replaced my iphone 6s and find this mobile an excellent replacement, which is more than a match for the iphone 6s apple are due to disgard in the coming months in an vailed attempt to force me and others to upgrade to an extortionate replacement, a failed strategy in my respect",
            "Phone is smooth but Google maps app is very lagging and disappointing. While I was driving the display gave me a notification that this route contains less traffic and then subsequently an option to exit or cancel the message...but it wouldn't cancel and most of the app was pretty unresponsive too. The app also crashed a few time too. The screen wouldn't rotate when I wanted it to. I really had to rotate the screen for an app like YouTube to rotate. Disappointing. I wasn't expecting this from Google stock android phone. It happened to the Samsung S3 all those years ago.",
            "I wanted a small compact mobile phone but I was limited as not much choice.I required that the phone had a reasonable    chip set, screen and camera.  The country is not 5g ready so was happy to accept 4g networks.  The difficult part is using Android 11 as it has lost the the 3 function keys from bottom of the screen.",
            "Great phone so far but not had it long but time will tell",

            "Love this phone.Very fast, always on the latest updates.I really like the size of the phone. I think most of the phones just are oversized. This one fits in my pocket, and in my hands.The quality of the images are excellent. The night sight mode is the perfect and the photos are sharp even in low light conditions.The camera also comes with lots of options like 360, fisheye.",
            "It's ok, but disappointed that there's no gallery app for photos on the device. Google Photos is great as a backup but I like to see my photos on my phone.",
            "I loved my Pixel 3a so was very keen to upgrade to the 4a and I wasn't disappointed.  There a few things that are slightly different, but after 1 week I have got the hang of it and love it.  Bonus having double the memory too!",
            "Great device! A lot of value here and the performance of the battery is amazing. I had a Nexus 5x... then a Samsung a8 2018...this one is way better",
            "Coming from Samsung A series it feels more robust. Initial setup was easy but like most it is the little things that take more time. It took me a while to find the home, back and close apps buttons. I am used to buttons and did not really like swiping. A pity the buttons are the opposite way round to the Samsung. Also have not found how to close all apps in one go. The phone seems fast and can be seen in most light. The adaptive brightness is pretty good. Camera seems good although I have not yet really used it. The night site is excellent.Generally I think we will get along fine.",
            "I used this great phone for a couple of days, everything worked well except for making calls.Every time I used the phone I would get a message, Reconnecting reconnecting.The call would drop and then connect again.So I returned the phone, we use mobile phones for everything in our lives , but if the basic phone does not work it is useless",
            "Had the phone for 12 days. Very happy with it. I have always had Samsung Android phones so was apprehensive about changing, but I really did not like my last phone Samsung A70 so chose to upgrade early. Did some research and asked advice from service provider shop. They said Google Pixel 4a 5G was good and the reviews I had read were mainly positive. I'm 55 and want a good camera, an easy phone and a good value package. Don't game or stream films etc. Really like the camera and again it is easy to use. So far I am loving this phone and very glad I chose it",
            "Brilliant sized phone, easily pocketable yet with decent screen. The camera works very well, as indeed does everything else. My surprise favourite feature is the fact that the name of songs playing around me (eg in a restaurant) are shown on the lock screen. Surprisingly useful!",
            "Excellent phone, great screen. Would highly recommend.",
            "The pixel line up has improved so much and now it made me move from my old iPhone 8 to the Pixel 4a 5g. Yes it took a while to get used to the giant display, but now I can watch daddy Linus tech tips on a bigger screen and also enjoy Anthony slot his ram into the DIMM slots. It is beautiful. Thanks Google, keep up the good work!",
            "I got mine set up in shop. Not being phone savvy. Without shop help, I think I would have struggled.(why do phone makers not give written instructions anymore?)Had to go back to shop due to being unable to silence notification alerts .Now I'm up and running I'm happy with device. ....... So far so good . I'll keep you posted.",
            "So I read many reviews about the pixel 4a and when my pixel 2 finally died I got the 4a. Safe to say I'm not happy the camera isn't nearly as good l the screen is not smash proof(I've already cracked it) . Over all of you are looking for a cheaper phone to get you through this is fine, but it is no where near what I think it should be.",
            "This phone is wonderful I can easily post stuff on social media without being banned very smooth and easy to use and on my word the camera is superb! Genuinely the best camera I've ever used on anythingHighly recommended phone much better than apple.",
            "I love the phone, it easy to use and has a fab camera on the back. I would highly recommend it to other people",
            "Worth every penny you spend. Most solid software ever.",
            "Takes a bit of getting use to especially shutting down/exiting  or closing an app, no obvious button and a couple of times I thought I had shut down app only to have it running in the background and drain the battery, where the old phone you just pressed bottom right hand side to shut down",
            "When you think what you pay for an iPhone these days even a model or two earlier than the latest. I challenge you to try this phone and see what you get for the price especially the amazing camera. Let's not forget the best operating system Android with all the latest features at your fingertips",

            "I find the Pixel a good. alrounder and excellent value for money",
            "ok so the device is good, not perfect. the fingerprint sensor on the back works well. the screen is nice, the OS works as it should. Battery life is amazing. I was surprised that it didn't have 4k video capture when my oneplus 3t does. other than that it's faultless.",
            "Not had the phone long ...just getting used to it but so far so good......",
            "Does everything you need battery can last up to 2 days without charge super charging is amazing for my daily routine",
            "This phone really is the perfect size and fits well in my hand. It's a shame that putting any case on it, even a very slim one, makes a difference. But that does speak to how well-sized the phone itself is.It's very snappy and the usability on the whole is good. Replacing the navigation buttons with gestures works very well except for the back button, which gets inadvertently gestured far too often when swiping through photos or pages.The lack of LED notification light and face unlock keep this as a 4-star device for me. I know the LED has generally trended away from most phones but to their detriment. Always-on isn't as quickly informative to me. And since fingerprint isn't as reliable as face unlock, especially when you may only have one hand available, I miss this feature as well.It is a good value overall for what you get though I'll probably upgrade it within 18 months.",
            "Kinda annoyed there's no 5g coverage tbh, otherwise, 5*",
            "Once I learnt all the uses found this phone easy to use and navigate between apps",

            "Originally owning a pixel 2xl....and then having another phone I decided to go back to getting a pixel.....I have no regrets....things just work smoothly.... system, camera, and updates....pleased in so many ways...got it at a good price and can't put it down....For me I would say the complete phone package at the right price....Not sure I would stray again from the pixel phones.....If you are thinking about a pixel then go for it......",
            "Great phone easy to use as I'm an oldie! Simple set up and a whole new world",
            "I've had the phone for just over a week and am perfectly happy with it. Set up was simple, transferring everything from my previous Pixel 3.I've taken few photographs yet as I've not really been anywhere to do that. However, those I have area clear and sharp.I have no complaints nor faults to report.",

            "I rate my 4a as Good value for money. Its a replacement for my 3. Its obviously faster, otherwise not much difference for good or bad. One very annoying tendency it has just like the 3 is resetting alerts to minimum volume. Not withstanding that, the key aspect for me liking the 4a is the camera is excellent and price acceptable for spec.",
            "I purchased this phone as a change from the usual smart phone brands.I was attracted to the price as well as the full Google experience.I'm happy so far however coming from a Huawei I have noticed that the battery life isn't what I expected.I'm a medium to heavy user and I barely get a day out of the phone.",
            "Love the Google Pixel phone and upgraded to the 4a after the 3. Enjoy it just as much with the exception of 1 major flaw which is the navigation. Having to swipe to go back is a major pain especially if you're looking at photos or something. Seems like a clever change not really thought out.",
            "Not a bad phone, however, the battery life is pretty poor compared to previous phones I've had. I'd likely send it back if I could :( it cannot make it through the day without charging. Shame!",

            "I came from the Pixel 3 and have been happy with the general  performance of the Pixel 4a, however the battery usually needs to be charged by the afternoon, which is disappointing. The 3 used to last until the evening.",

            "I moved to the Pixel 4a from the iPhone 8, chosen over the iPhone XR and I'm utterly thrilled with my choice. The phone runs buttery smooth with no signs of lack or need to wait to refresh.  The camera massively outperforms its stats providing extremely rich and sharp images with true-to-life colours.  The battery is almost impossible to kill. With moderate use including internet browsing, calls, messaging, taking photos and some light gaming I'll go to bed with well over 40% when I'd almost always have to give my old iPhone a little boost most days.  My only complaint is the screen - it is beautifully clear and truthfully better than the iPhone I've moved from, but it does struggle outdoors in direct sunlight and is almost not visible unless the brightness is fully turned up. Google have also added some extremely helpful Google-specific apps including a notes app and google podcast which I find more user friendly and streamlined than both apple podcasts and Spotify.  Thrilled.",

            "These phones are not known for the brightness of their screens. The screen on the example I got was exceptionally DULL. Even on 80 percent brightness setting the screen was still duller than all other phones I have recently had at much lower levels of brightness.",
            "This is my first Pixel and I love it. I was looking for something mid range and this is great value for money. The camera is excellent, the phone runs smoothly and rapidly. All the little details such as the gestures and built in Google software are smart.",

            "Had the phone a week. Easy to set up and works well. Camera and battery both good value for money. Only thing I don't like is how you close apps (up from the bottom) and the back/swipe from the right. Sure I'll get used to them and don't regret buying.",
            "Upgraded from the 3a - really like this phone. It's basic but I like the form factor. So far so good.",
            "Pixel 4a is the best phone I've owned. I'm a pensioner and find it very easy to use. I would have preferred a back button instead of swiping but I have adjusted to this feature. It's a great size to hold comfortably in my hand. Camera takes good pictures. I'm delighted with purchase",
            "I owned a pixel 3XL before this and must say the overall pixel 4a 5g has just a lot of cost cutting incorporated to accommodate the low price and I preferred the older models. Simply satisfactory as it does the job but nothing great about it. Little disappointed. Loved my old NOT PINK pixel 3XL.",

            "Not had the phone long, has not taken me long to realize I had a great one.It is superb, when it comes to photographs. very handy when your fishing. Or have any pastime you like to keep record of. Iv used it to cast movies to my tv, which it has done both with amazing quality , but also with much much greater ease then any other iv had, and with no annoying constant loses of signal etc. In short it really really is a great little phone, So why not the full five stars. Well its only and it is a small let down, But the volume on the phone, for me, is just not quite right. As I said up front, iv not had this long, and I'm no technical expert. maybe a change of head phones or the like, might get it the five stars later. But what your getting now is an honest review from an average guy. Who would gladly tell any of my friends, hay get one of these. in fact, were i to be offered an upgrade or phone change by my supplier. at this point in time id decline. I'm liking this so much.",

            "I am a great fan of the google pixel 4a, as it is a phone that runs very well so far (since if only had it for around 5 days). The android operating system is easy to use and simple, and the camera is very detailed up to now, even though i havent had the chance to use it much since i dont take a huge amount of photos. Either way, the camera is definetely as good as my previous phone, the google pixel 3, if not better. The screen is oled, and it is visible that it is oled since the colours are vibrant and the black areas on the screen are very dark, making the screen very pleasing to the eye. In conclusion, I really like this phone since it has a great screen, a great camera and overall is really impressive for the pretty low price.",
            "Was hesitant of changing from Samsung to Google, but am so happy that I did. Fantastic phone, easy to use",
            "I am really pleased with this phone. You're  getting quite a lot for your money. Fast and smooth operating system and Oled Display. The main camera is great and takes very natural looking photos. The Ultra-wide photos are not quite as clear  as the main camera but they are still very acceptable.  Good battery life and charges from 10% to 85% in about 45 minutes.",
            "I’ve previously had several Motorola phones and been happy with them. When I needed a new phone I automatically looked at getting a new one of those.. I then discovered they are all huge and that’s not what I like so looked elsewhere and so many of them are also too big. I searched for a phone the size of my old Moto G5 and came across the Google Pixel 4a and read several good reviews and took a chance on buying one.  Wow, what a revelation. Superior in every way to what I have ever used before, although, to be fair it is more expensive but still not silly money. I am very very happy it’s so good. Thank goodness Motorolas became so big!",
            "Great size, lovely to handle and the position of the biometric sensor is perfect. So many great features to explore and it's really easy to navigate. With a great camera, amazing display and noted for its durability, what's not to love?",
            "If you love Samsung but want something cheaper, this is definitely worth a try. Very similar set up and tools. Really easy to set up and operate. Really pleased with my phone.",
            "Nice fone gave it to my kids. Easy to use and feels nice to hold.",
            "For me it seems to be easier to navigate. It has a recorder and other easy to access  apps. I no longer have to swipe to answer my phone so that is a plus. I am not a tech   person so am no expert in that department. Glad I got it.",
            "Excellent software support from google, I hope they keep this series of pixle phones going for a long time coming",
            "As a mobile phone user from the 90s when they became affordable to my first 'smartphone' a htc legend,Nokia Lumia 930 and then a nexus 5x,Google pixel 1,Samsung a70 and my present phone I got recently a Google pixel 4a,my experience over the years has always been focused on value for money and features,namely the camera for me as i am a keen amature photographer I have always found the nexus and Google 1 to be superb and user friendly focused with each new model building on the ethos of the past phones, it is a delight to see the current pixel following on in this theme of providing a phone that does everything the normal person needs and can afford, for sure there are a plethora of other makes and models out there with massive MP sensors but for me the one in the pixel is more than enough and combined with brilliant software and hardware it has knocked me for six in astrophotography images.I recommend this pixel 4a for anyone wanting a phone that will not break the piggy bank.",
            "I started buying Google pixel phones after using IPhones and I was so pleasantly surprised by my experience. I prefer the selfie camera on the iPhones but that's about it. This is the perfect size for everyday use, I generally used to like smaller phones but the PPI and screen size, paired with 5G network make this a really good platform to watch videos on, which I tend to do alot. Despite hearing bad things about the gesture navigation I really like it, and it was easy to get used to. Other features like the \"split screen\" functionality and the great battery life / saver settings really took this phone to another level for me personally. Being a Google phone too I've never had a problem with updates or the OS in general, like I have had with other phones. The back cameras are awesome and although I don't use them as much as I should, if I ever want to capture a moment I can do, and the resulting picture is great quality. This is really good value for money for a camera phone.",
            "Easy upgrade. No problems with transfer. Impressed with the camera and the images it takes and the smooth action in moving from app to app.",
            "The Pixel 4a 5g if an awesome phone, don't hesitate to buy one",
            "I got these phone one hundred pounds cheaper about a week ago and good at that price.\nArgos delivery was good as always and excellent service, not much more you can say.",
            "Nice phone , bought for its size as it hard finding a smallish phone.  Happy with everything so far.  It a bit different to go back a page but I'm sure it will become the norm soon.  Battery life I had read review which said not great. It's not. Finding if I use it to watch TV etc it barley makes it to afternoon.  That the biggest annoyance.  It's a nice phone  good camera . Also although it has a focus mode unlike my previous phone that blocked sound notifications the focus mode blocks everything till it's either paused or the period ends.   I've not managed to check if my favourites or stared people would still by pass. Working from home for now so it's fine not to have this on.  The voice activation need to start with the press of the assistant button  which seems take away the main benefit . I had an old Moto X  where ok Google would do anything.",
            "Awesome phone .. great display, fast charge, easy set up ... Awesome camera - excellent portrait and editing features ... Finger sensor works perfectly and a headphone jack to top it off. Not to mention the amazing price compared to flag ship phones!",
            "The phone is smaller than other phones, this is a plus though as it is easier to move from pocket to hand and is lighter to hold. Great having assistant answer any question even when locked and in your pocket. Very different to use from my usual Samsung choice, but only after a day or two now and it has become second nature. A great small phone with a huge punch!!! Will now stick with Google phones!",
            "Love the Google Pixel 4A phone , would recommend to anyoneThank you",
            "Heavy iOS user and first time on pixel.surprised on how good this phone is. Good purchase",
            "Honestly there is nothing I can hate about this phone. It's officially been a week and I'm loving it.. beautiful camera quality, brilliant screen, amazing sound quality. Bought it with the pixel ear buds, amazing charge on these and the case! Only had to charge them once (last night) used them for at least a few hours everyday and they work brilliantly with the phone",
            "I have been pleasantly surprised by the move having only been an iphone user before.I love the flexibility that you get from Android. There were several features of ios that I really disliked and I don't need to put up with them any more!I like the look (full screen) and feel of the phone - it fits well in my hand. Althogether much happier than I expected!",
            "The picture quality is superb much better than my old phone. The performance is snappy and the display is excellent. 5/5",
            "Very happy with performance and design. Cheers ☺️☺️",
            "I got my Google Pixel 4a 5g last week and it is an exceptional device, fast and with many Hidden features like live captioning. I am a convert.",
            "I'm not a heavy user, don't use streaming/play games. I've been very impressed with this mid price range device. Compactness was my No 1 priority and it's one of a very few phones in this size.",
            "Clean UI and very easy to understand. Software updates regular and are guaranteed for three years making security and feature set increasing and improving.",
            "I just love this phone! My first Pixel and it definitely won't be my last. Great camera, great features and can't fault delivery and customer services. Highly recommended.",
            "I used to be a Samsung user, but I'm never going back. This phone is great through and through",
            "not worth for the money. I feel I did a mistake by buying this product",
            "I have used Google phones a lot over the years and although another brand phone is fine you always get such a better experience with a Google phone everything just works and the software flows smoothly, one major bonus is the lack of bloatware.The Google camera is something special as well always surprised what a small sensor like this can achieve.The one area I find lacking on Google devices is the customisation options available with other brands but that's pretty minor and in no way a deal breaker.",
            "I had my old phone for ages, and was resistant to getting a new one. But my partner bought himself a Pixel 4a and I was so impressed with it that I got one too! It's fast, intuitive to use, and looks really great. Particularly love the camera, and the speakers sound great for listening to music and podcasts.",
            "Bought this phone to replace my samsung s10 5g. After reading up and hearing more about the Google pixel 4a I decided to push the button... All I can say is what an great little budget phone it is, the camera is a powerhouse which puts most devices to shame, the cpu runs really well with no stutters or crashes and is really smooth while in use plus all the features are really helpful and help navigate around the phone easier. If you're looking for a budget phone that's got everything look no further",
            "I like it a lot it has no glitches and it is really good overall. I love the google assistant as it is really helpful",
            "Best Android phone around. Pure simple smooth experience. Perfect size phone.",
            "Surprised at how easy it is to navigate.. only my 2nd android so was nervous of the change.  All the little pixel tips are very useful",
            "The phone is sleek and stylish. \nThe camera is pretty impressive, the number of modes and adjustments that can be made are a bonus, but I imagine the quality wouldn't perhaps be on so impressive to a pro photographer.\nThe OS is nice and user friendly, switching over from the old phone was the easiest I've ever experienced. There have been a few glitches/bugs but these have been very minor and appear to be fixed quickly. \n\nAs a casual user, this phone is ideal. Overall very happy with it",
            "Lovely phone, very good quality camera, everything works well (fast too) Good battery life. Extremely happy with it.",
            "The phone itself is just what I wanted, but I may have to return it unless Google can tell me how to get it to work properly with secured wifi networks.  From googling the internet I see that this is a problem affecting many users of this phone.",
            "Camera is superb. Other features of Google 1 make it worthy. I was under impression that google provides unlimited google storage for Pixel phone users. However, it gives users 100 GB cloud storage  to save pics & videos.",
            "Amazing little mobile phone  - fast, good battery life, great software experience, fantastic camera. Did I mention the price? I have no hesitation in recommending the Pixel line to everyone I meet!!",
            "Great phone,smooth,good battery and slot of space.",
            "I am enjoying my time with this phone the camera is brill and the android only experience is exactly what I want no gimmicks",
            "The Google Pixel 4, is okay nothing different really from pixel 3. They're added swipe to go back, which is fine but when the swipe control is close to other documents you end up deleting or removing them. So I've had to put the three buttons, which is also annoying they're so big and unattractive, I had the pixel 3 which you could control with one small line and a small back arrow much better looking if you wanted the phone to look sleeker.Overall the phone works well, camera is as good as a Samsung..but not a lot of changes from pixel 3.",
            "This technophobe has been struggling with a mobile that came out of the ark. Resisted replacing it for a very very long time. This phone was recommended and so far it has been an extremely smart move. Super quick, easy to use and packed with loads of stuff I don't know how to use yet. Wish I'd done it sooner",
            "Brilliant phone, great camera! Very happy with it. Brilliant price too.",
            "What a great value handset.If you're running an Android phone then common sense suggests to have a handset made by the OS designerGreat display, great to use, amazing camera and a great priceLove it....in fact we have 3 X Pixel 4a's in the household because they tick all the boxes",
            "Great phone! Just wish it had wireless charging. Overall I really like it",
            "Moved from apple after a few years now. Was hoping Google will offer me a storage plan with the phone. I already have an iCloud account from my Mac and iPhones in the past .The phone is great and love it. I don't think I will go back to apple phones again.",
            "Really quick and easy to use as well as set up. Great pictures, the speakers sound awesome - through the phone and via the headphone jack.",
            "Great photos charges good great sounds for you tube",
            "Changing up from a 3a I would say Google have no doubt improved upon what was already a great phone.I particularly like the camera with it's Astrophotography feature, beats the iPhone hands down!I have had Google phones for some years now and see no reason to pay the exorbitant prices for Samsung and Apple phones.Keep up the great work Google!",
            "I love this phone. Perfect size and does everything you need a phone to do. Much prefer it to my old phone Samsung S10 5g",
            "Google pixel 4a is a great phone easy to use , amazing camera , great for price.",
            "A perfect smartphone for everyone. Perfect size, nice display, light weight, nice software experience, nice for photography, superb battery life, good speakers.Sound output  through 3.5mm headphone jack could have been better, I will rate 4.5 out of 5 because of this.",
            "Love the Pixel 4a. Compact, lightweight, everything you need in a phone including a headphone jack(which my Pixel 4XL doesn't have).A higher resolution screen,wireless charging and faster refresh rate on the next one please",
            "I had the Google Pixel 3 and was due to upgrade on my phone contract. The Pixel 5 was a bit pricey for me so I opted for the 4a and really regret  it. It feels like a downgrade. The colour on the screen feels really washed out compared to the 3. And I find the touch screen lacks any intuition. Online shopping is clumsy - it clicks into items you're not interested in and when you try to go back, it brings you back to the homepage. There's a delay with the keypad when I type. I'm gutted I'm stuck with this phone now for 36 months on my contract. And even worse, I traded in my Pixel 3 to my service provider. It was 100% a better phone. This was NOT an upgrade.",
            "Nice phone for the money, I love it would by another 1 if anything happens to this one, 5g really fast no messing around., Didn't no weather 2 by it at first but so glad I did...",
            "If I could go back in time I wouldn't select this phone. I read the reviews and ignored the comments about the new set up. Wish I'd listened.I know how to use the phone without the Home, Back, and Tabs buttons at the bottom, however, my phone doesn't agree.No matter how much I swipe, press, fast, slow, plead the gestures only work about 20% of the time on the first go. It's driving me nuts.I ignored the other reviews because I'm great with tech and strongly believe half the difficulty for most people with technology is mind set and a dislike of change. Now I know that in the case it's just a bad system.Gutted",
            "Latest version of Android, guaranteed for the next 3 major versions. Fingerprint scanner works perfectly. Recommended.",
            "Pixel 4a 5g: Everything I wanted in a mid price phone.  I updated from a Pixel 3a, the difference is huge.  Clear screen, user friendly, adaptive and fully functional with a Chromebook.  More volume",
            "Neat phone with a good screen. A slightly more comprehensive start up manual would be a great help. Battery life isn't great. This isn't helped by the number of apps running in the background which seem impossible to stop or disable. My phone discharges just over 1%ph even when not in use.",
            "Great value for money. Easy set up by connecting new phone to my outgoing Samsung, quick and painless transfer of all apps etc. Super display and the size is just right, not too big, but not too small.Very quick to download from the internet. The battery life is the best ever .",
            "Had my Pixel 4a for a week and love it  Compact,  everything runs smoothly and pure android is a revelation after being away from it since the days of owning a Nexus 5x. The camera is awesome.",
            "the battery life is pretty long and the recharge time is quick as heck plus the cpu is on point handling high disk/memory mobile games. might get another one for 2nd gaming alternative account honestly.",
            "Had issue with freezing up then restarting . Fixed now not sure how Had issue with SMS toolkit faulting out uninstalled it that seems to have sorted it although the play store wants to update it .Don't like the phone screen why doesn't it come up with dial numbers as soon as you click on the app.Finally I cannot get the facial recognition to work can't find it in settings.As it's a new os for me I currently wouldn't recommend that said I may grow into it",
            "The camera is very good  and cool and I like the live captions",
            "I am really happy with this phone. Still getting used to using it. I keep getting a error message which is annoying . But have found out information on fixing the problem. That is the reason I got a Google phone any issues will be discussed and fixed.",
            "A very good upgrade to the phone i had(Pixel 3a). Better camera, better performance. I'm loving it.",
            "Extremely happy with my purchase and very surprised how easy it was to transfer all my stuff from my old mobile.",
            "Had a pixel 3a which I was extremely happy with. Upgraded seamlessly to pixel 4, very happy with it. Does everything I need without clutter. Integrates with my other Google products without any fuss. Happy customer.",
            "Excellent build quality,  simple to set up from my existing Google account, beautiful screen, good camera plus fast to load apps etc.",
            "I love this phone, I had the last 3 pixels and find them so easy to use, I had to use a spare Huawei phone recently when I drove over my pixel and it was difficult to get used to and crashed daily, new w back on pixel 4a and I'll never want to use any other brands again.",
            "My past phones I found were always way too big in my hands and had a load of random stuff that I didn't need. This little guy is everything I wanted though. Slick, compact and simple.",
            "I got this phone as an upgrade from my Pixel 2XL - and I'm really happy with it. The resolution is great, and was really easy to set up. If you're a fan of the pixel phones I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Only tweak is that I wish the battery lasted a little longer.",
            "Brought this phone as I broke my HTC. This phone is easy to use and the night camera is really impressive. Haven't used to its full extent yet, but really happy from what I have seen so far! Would definitely recommend this phone.",
            "Had the phone a week now and I am just so impressed. The support from Google is excellent, the phone comes with an on board guide and it is amazing.The things that it can do are brilliant, linking in to smart equipment, Bluetooth, picked my printer up immediately. Google assistant, like the phone is very intuitive.As a disabled person (MS) this phone is the very best I have ever used.Thank you Google",
            "I've only had the phone a few weeks but so far I'm very pleased. Good size- not too big or small, and the picture quality is really good. Touch screen is responsive and the camera is top notch. I have a Google nest and mini so I'm syncing it all up to my phone for easy access to everything.",
            "What a excellent phone every thing works perfect, software is excellent and especially the camera  keep up the good work",
            "Was happy to swap from the Sam S range for this. Takes great photos in which I was looking for mainly in a device.",
            "Don't know if I'm just unlucky but this phone only lasted for 22hrs and that includes 8hrs sleep, only changed because my 2xl gave up but it was much better than this, don't need headphone jack will probably go to Samsung S20 plus or S21 plus, shame I liked the pixel",
            "Upgraded from Pixel 3, which is now permanently mounted on my 10 inch newtonian as a star finder and astrophotography device.The transfer was easy and the phone is great, nothing hugely better but clearly superior. The standard phone jack is nice as I can charge and listen without using bluetooth.",
            "NFC icon not working even though set up for Google Pay. Dare not use the phone to pay. Never had this problem with my old 1 .",
            "Funky little phone. Easy to use , good camera and very intuitive.",
            "The Pixel is a great device. Very light in the hand with intuitive on-screen controls.  Feels minimal and efficient with apps, settings and gestures. None of the extra pointless stuff you get with brands eg. Samsung or Sony. Seamless move cos I have Gmail, Google Photos, Drive etc already.The camera is great quality - tested on a black cat and bright colours. Overall really impressed, a great value phone. The official fabric cases are very nice too.",
            "Overall great clean software with plenty of trick up it's sleeve but camera is disappointment compared to a Samsung phone. I was led to believe the software on the camera was amazing but it can only compensate so much for the hardware.",
            "Mostly good. Annoying that you have to scroll news items to top to exit from them. Don't want my photos sorted by Google into groups - just in date order please. Great that phone not too big for me to hold. Good camera.",
            "Lovely small phone, feels great in the hand. Does everything I want with a phone plus an amazing camera, which makes any photo you take look half decent without any effort. For the price it's a very incredible phone worth the buy. And because it's a Google phone you get a lot of android updates and fantastic Google features.",
            "Best you can get .\nGreat camera ,fast and clean android.",
            "Simple small pixel 4a is by far the best handset i have owned",
            "Great product that fully integrates with current BMWs",
            "I love my new Google 4a. It is so easy to use and with it being Google will get three years Android updates, which I'm happy about.",
            "This phone has fantastic performance, especially for its price. The camera takes photos out of this world and the software is fantastic. The fingerprint scanner is fast and the screen is great too, battery life is okay, I get a day out of it easily, but my previous phone used to last 1.5 days. I love the smaller form and the light weight of it too, much more ergonomic.",
            "Just wish it was a bigger screen like on the Samsung note.",
            "This phone is well built, fast and slick. I am not really interested in what processor it might have, or its refresh rate, and I don't watch movies or play games on it, I just want a reliable phone. Comes with a fast charge plug  and cable, and yes, it is fast!!!It does all the major things well, i.e. call quality, messaging both text and video, and apps like Facebook and YouTube work well. It is updated before most other phones and it doesn't come pre-loaded with unwanted apps which is a bonus too.I drop a star on one thing only and that is for the sound, not the quality but the volume! It seems very quiet to me (though at 68 perhaps I am getting deaf).Overall, I would recommend a Pixel 4a",
            "Very good phone, have no issues to talk of, could do with more pre installed ring and notification sounds",
            "With out doubt the best phone I've owned. Perfect size for one handed operation. Camera excellent. Fluid operation great screen. Al in all a great phone.",
            "I've moved from a 5 year old phone to this phone. So when reading this please remember that my old phone is my only comparison and therefore this phone seems amazing! I've now had it for a week and love it. The main plus of this phone is the camera, which is amazing! The battery life lasts about a day and a half, which is surprising as I expected to have to charge it every night. The size is a nice size, maybe slightly larger than I'd like personally. I can't really complain at all, but my minor complaint is the ordering of apps, if you could order by most used that would be helpful. On the whole we have decided that it's a great phone and that we will get another for my wife.",
            "This phone does everything I need. I came from a Galaxy S8. I love the fact that it's pure Android and has a hefty amount of internal storage. The only thing I do miss is a notification light but that's a minor detail.",
            "Love my new pixel. The only thing that annoys me is the screenshot feature. Having to press the buttons on the side is really annoying! My old Huawei was so much easier by touching the screen. Getting used to not having a back arrow is a bit strange. But I'm getting there....",
            "On paper, this phone (and all the Pixel phones) seem like a great idea, unfortunately, they rarely ever go according to plan, I previously had a Pixel 3, which had to be replaced due to it being faulty, the replacement device also needed to be replaced as it was faulty, they replaced it with a Pixel 4a, which is arguably neither better or worse than the Pixel 3. The fingerprint sensor has always been an issue on Pixel devices, with all 3 of my Pixel phones having pretty bad fingerprint sensors, barely able to recognise my fingerprint if there is even the slightest bit of moisture or debris, something that any other phone doesn't struggle with at all. In terms of performance, the Pixel phones are great, they're speedy, responsive and they really do feel premium, the same with the camera (Although the Pixel 3 camera is far better than the 4a, somehow).Overall, I wouldn't recommend the Pixel line of phones, they promise a lot, but a lot of those promises fall short.",
            "At a mid range price gives very good value. Good performance as a voice phone. Pretty smooth and high quality display performance for the price point. Very nice size which makes one hand operation easy. Finger recognition works well and is very convenient. Excellent software/operating system. Excellent still photos. Pretty good videos which can be shaky but acceptable for most purposes. Overall I am very happy with the Pixel 4a which, though not a \"flagship\" type phone, is especially good for the price.",
            "I  acquired the Pixel 4a to replace my Pixel 3a after I'd accidentally damaged it.  I found it to be entirely satisfactory and straightforward, and as quick as I need a phone to be.  Only a couple of weeks experience with it and nothing unusual to report, but the battery life is much better than its predecessor.",
            "I always gravitated towards Google-made phones. I did own a couple of other brands (and even an iPhone), but now that I got back to Android and bought this Pixel 4A I am really not looking back.It's quite light for the size and it's lightning fast. I find it looks really good and I love the camera. It does way more than I need it to do to be fair, and Android 11 on it is just fantastic. I really like the gestures and not having to deal with buttons, I got used to the gestures really quick.It feels very premium, definitely recommended.",
            "Great device, simple but classy design, amazing camera. It's my first 5g smartphone and wow, getting up to 600Mbps download speed in my area. I'm super happy with the Pixel",
            "Fulfilled all expectations",
            "Interface is not easy / familiar to use.....Though the phone itself is good it's the no back button that causes problems, swiping from right edge to the left is too close to the delete function. Grrrrr",
            "Great phone and amazing photos. The software is easy to use.",
            "I love my pixel phones I've had one of each and so far this is the best I've had. It's easy to use without been too easy, the camera is awesome and the new gesture controls rather than the buttons at the bottom is great now I've got used to them lol xx however I just wanted something more something extra it's too similar to the 3. I wanted to be wowed. Another downside is the lack of earphones. Cheap move Google.",
            "Went to Apple after upgrading to the Pixel 4XL (which I hated) from the pixel 3a (which I loved). Gone back to the pixel 4a 5G and very glad I did. Love this phone.",
            "Does what it says on the box. Lasts 2 days without recharge and does everything and more than I need. It's more than fast enough even on 4g downloads with a decent screen for my usage. I particularly like the dedicated security features. Which means my info remains secure, and with a clean operating system updated regularly and future proof for years to come, with the option of 5g rollout, all at a good value for money price. However for me the deciding factor was wired headphone option in a good quality phone.  What's not to like.",
            "I love mi pixel 4a the camera is amazing, it's responsive. The display is clear and the speakers are loud. The Google case is also great.Well done google for such a fantastic product.",
            "Nice screen, good camera. I am very happy with it, can recommend.",
            "I wanted a smallish phone for my pocket with upto date tech, a good canera and a reasonable price.  That narrowed the search to the OnePlus Nord and the 4a.  Now I am not a power user so the Nord's superior specs were not especially attractive due to its larger size and higher price.  In addition reviews said that in practice the 4a picture quality was at least as good as the Nords. Thee 4a was thus  a compromise but one that best fitted my needs.In use, its size is perfect for me, nicely slipping in its case into my back pocket.  It is smaller than my previous OnePlus 3T and this I like. It is faster than that phone and it's camera is I think superior with rich and detailed images.In my usage battery life is fine, I am rarely down to 40% by the end of the day, but remember I use the phone for browsing, messaging and not watching video or gaming.So, a great product for me so far with no regrets on purchase.",
            "A really great phone, very impressed with the camera and the battery life is pretty good. Easily copes with a day of usage and charges up very quickly, with the option to slow charge overnight to protect the battery.",
            "I got this phone to take advantage of wi-fi calling from my new provider. It's actually a lower spec than my previous phone, a flagship from a couple of years ago, and I was a bit worried I'd notice the difference but I needn't have been concerned. The phone is really nice to use. Everything just works! A decent screen, great finger print sensor, good quality sound from the 3.5mm headphone jack (thank you for retaining that, Google. I don't want to carry more dongles around!). The camera is a standout feature - particularly the portrait mode. Also note I think of it, the battery life is surprisingly good. I easily get a full day and a half out of a charge.Finally I really like the feel of the phone. It reminds me of my old Nexus 5. It's plastic but has a very nice grippy feel to it. Very pleased and for the price it's a no brainer.",
            "This little phone is perfect for those looking for a great camera at an affordable price. You can't beat savings. First ever Pixel and WILL get again!",
            "No issues, it's a good and decent phone so time to get one",
            "Seems all good. Replacing a battered pixel 2 XL wanted 5G but not to be hit with apple tax. Decent mid range, no 5g in my area yet. Sadface",
            "Great little phone, smooth and quick running times 100 percent recommended",
            "For a budget phone the pixel 4a has very decent specs. Device comes shipped with android 11 out of the box which is stock android. The camera takes great, crisp and sharp photos. The phone itself feels nice in the hand, although not premium, but i can understand seeing its in the budget price range. Unfortunately i had to return the phone due to the poor battery life. I've gone for oneplus nord which comes in nearly at the same price, but feels more premium and packs a far better knockout punch in terms of specs.",
            "This phone is really good! My last phone was rubbish and never got updates. This one gets regular updates which is important.",
            "I purchased this phone to replace my HTC The size is quite good Not 2 large It has the same internals as the pixel 5 The only difference is a plastic body & the glass isn't as durable I have found it quite slow compared to my HTC The sound is not so good its crackly & keeps going very quiet then loud It's not @ all consistent It has no notification light You have 2 delete messages 1 @ a time You can't delete all in 1 go Overall for the money its OK I did get £100 off in the promotion",
            "Good phone, good price. I'd watch an online review rather than my opinion but I like it so far, and camera is good.",
            "Been considering purchase for some time and that it was available at Argos, which is very close to home, was the best and easiest option.  Very powerful and got a journey on getting familiar with its many features.",
            "I purchased the 4a 5g after I found the Pixel 5 too small, the only real hardware difference is the 90hz display which I thought I would miss but don't notice. It has no ip rating but tbats not too much of a concern. \nI prefer the size and feel over most other android phones, the battery is very good and easily lasts the whole day until lights out and thats 5am till 10pm. It charges quick and the camera is truly one of the best on a smartphone. Stereo speakers so great crisp sound, Oled screen",
            "The Google Pixel 4a 5G is a great value 5G phone. Battery easily lasts all day and it charges quickly. The display is quick and responsive and really clear. As always the Google Camera is great and so far I'm really pleased with my purchase.",
            "I had noticed Google had dropped the price of the Pixel 4a5G on their website by £100, but delivery was weeks away. I cancelled that order when I found Argos had it in stock the next day, at the same lower price, and picked it up from Sainsbury's in the morning.\nIt is a great phone. Not too too big. Speedy at everything. Great camera. 128GB enough memory for my foreseeable future.\nHighly recommended.",
            "If you are a fan of android you'll like this phone. Excellent battery life, great camera.",
            "Pros : Phone is well priced\nCon: Bit over sized",
            "I bought this phone to replace my Huawei P20 pro. It is an amazing upgrade and great value.",
            "had to return due to bluetooth issues and awful sound quality on recorded videos.",
            "I got this phone to replace my Pixel 3. Very capable but outstanding battery. Lasted me 32 hours on full charge. Love it.\n\nGot this for myself but would happily buy another one for my girlfriend. She loves landscape photography and this phone takes stunning pictures. Very fast too.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone. Great all round device that gets the important things really well.",
            "easy to use with 5G if you can get it",
            "Fantastic mid range device. Superb camera, with all the features you need. Stock Android is a joy with no unnecessary bloatware. No frills but it's that that makes it perfect. It's all you need in a phone. Easy to use and 3 years guaranteed software updates. Perfect.",
            "Read every review of all the flagship phones, costing twice as much as this, before deciding to buy the Pixel 4A 5G.\nI am so glad I chose this, it's unpretentious, but so classy in its understated efficiency.\nEverything about it works very well and logically, so no learning time.\nThe camera is brilliant and the battery lasts forever. \nDon't hesitate.",
            "Excellent phone - great pictures at low light",
            "Fantastic, all-round, easy to use phone . Especially great for the clarity of photography.",
            "I've owned the big expensive flagships and loved them, but they have been delicate, impractically heavy and expensive. This phone is light, durable and powerful enough to run all tasks, plus one of the best camera systems on the market",
            "This is a really lovely phone. Running the latest version of Android 11 and with the promise of 3 further upgrades.  The cameras are first rate with an excellent portrait mode. The phone also runs on any 5G enabled network in the UK. The battery life is phenomenal and lasts all day. For its price you cannot buy a better Android smartphone.",
            "I upgrade from my Lenovo mobile to google 4a 5g\nValue for money, very fast processor, batterie depended on what you are doing it's run one and a half days but also its charge vert fast, there is no home button but u can be used to after using some days, the camera and video are good nice big screen. the mobile phone doesn't come with any accessories.",
            "Great phone, nice screen, good battery life, no complaints",
            "it's a good mid-range phone, good value for the money you pay for and I recommend a protective case to use with the phone. I think google phones are the only ones worth buying because of the security updates",
            "Best value Google Pixel phone currently available.\nAll the things I need in a phone.\nResearch your own needs for a phone and buy what you like, but these phones are the best for the simple android experience without the added junk from the maker.",
            "Mobile photo’s is very good and processing is very fast I like it",
            "Great phone. Was a bit sceptical moving from a £1000 Samsung however, I had nothing to worry about. The phone works perfectly well, the camera is great and haven't regretted the move one bit. Highly recommended",
            "Camera doesnt work on it, faulty. Will be taking it back as soon as I can",
            "I upgraded from the pixel 1 and I can say if runs a lot smoother and there's a huge difference camera wise. I'm still getting used to the larger screen but I am very happy with my purchase",
            "call screening and hold for me features not working in UK.\nGoogle Gboard keyboard saved words don't sync when getting new phone.\nSo think before buying.\nOtherwise it's a good phone.\nBattery life is better than Samsung S20 series.\n3 years of updates.\nI will recommend getting OnePlus Nord if your living in UK.\nUS and Canada get all the Google features and Google experience. So sad for people out side US and Canada.",
            "What a great phone from Google, performance is plenty for me and all day battery is great with fast charging. One of the best point and shoot cameras out there right now and for the price you can't go wrong.",
            "Love the new phone. Takes great photos.",
            "Decided to try a Pixel mobile and so glad I did.  Very easy to set up use.",
            "I've always liked the Google Pixel phones and the stock Android look and feel.  I avoided the Pixel 4 due to issues that were reported, but this 4a 5G is simply fantastic.  Very fast and responsive, apps load quickly, Internet pages load super fast and scrolling is very smooth indeed.  There really isn't anything that I can fault about this phone and when 5G eventually reaches where I live, this phone is oven ready for it.  In a couple of words - buy it!",
            "Do all the jobs. You don't need high end phone for daily uses. This is actually a good phone.",
            "The phone and its applications are great. The cameras and apps work well, and are simple and easy to use on their own. Having previously used a Samsung, I found the navigation of the Pixel difficult. I found having to swipe between screens rather cumbersome, and this was the main downside for me. The phone performance and loading of web applications is quick and effortless.  For me a great phone, but the navigation lets it down overall.",
            "Easy to set up and use straight out the box. \nNo home or back button. Easy to navigate. \nGreat camera. Excellent to use in poor light conditions\nVery accessible to those with disabilities.",
            "Impressed with camera quality and touch is too sensitive. Fantastic sound quality.overall good buy",
            "The Pixel 4a 5G is a superb phone. Setup is super easy with only one password in the entire initialization phase.\nThe phone itself is a nice size without been too big. The screen is crisp and clear and very easy on the eye. The processor handles multi tasking with ease and the phone feels very slick.\nThe camera produces vibrant , clear shots that look great.\nBattery life is very impressive also.\nOverall I have to say this is one of the best phones I`ve ever used. Highly recommended",
            "This phone I would say is the best phone I've had so far. The battery is amazing! I can go the whole day on a charge and mess around with the phone browsing and playing music and come home in the evening with still 50% worth of battery. It does everything you would expect from a smartphone! It has an amazing design, brilliant camera and large memory! Quality and affordability in one great package!",
            "The Pixel 4a is a really lovely phone to use. The weight is great and feels good in your hands. The screen is crystal clear and the menus are your usual android ones so easy to use, and even if you move from other operating systems it’s easy to use and gets use to. My favourite thing about the phone is the camera, the quality is great. I would highly recommend this phone over some of its competition on the market"
