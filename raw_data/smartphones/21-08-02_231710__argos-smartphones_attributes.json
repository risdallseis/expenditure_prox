            "I bought the new SE as had the 1st generation and it’s so easy for me to use",
            "Bought this as a present for my wife (she was told iphones were great by her sister). About 3 days later she was demanding another phone!! Come back Microsoft phone, all is forgiven.",
            "So glad I decided to update to this phone! Its got all the new IOS features including memoji and more. Its the perfect size not too big to fit in your pocket and can be easily held with one hand. I also love the red colour looks so sleek",
            "iPhone is good and works well, and looks nice. A bit pricey which is why only given 4 stars not 5. I wanted a phone which I could use with one hand which I can with this one.\nNo issues setting it up (use Apple website for instructions).\nDealing with Argos was good as usual.",
            "Based on the prices of other mobile phones all the products of Apple are so expensive.",
            "I bought this as I was fed up with android then my Mum bought one a few days later for herself. She hates it because there's s muh you can't do that you can on Android. I can't even Bluetooth from.android to.ios as apple won't allowed it and the photos on my memory card didn't transfer with the iOS transfer app, the iPhone doesn't use a memory card. \nOverall I like it and think it's a good phone but it doesn't connect to WiFi through the quick access pull up bit so I have to go all the way into settings to put it on most of the time.\n\nAlso can't set purchased songs as ringtones as they are too long so you then have to purchase it again as a rigtone to be able to use it.\nWhen I get a pop up screen like PayPal checkout it doesn't let me scroll that page and only moves the main page behind it so I can even use PayPal checkout now with this issue, that didn't happen on my ipods.\nNot the best phone for everyone. probably be our first and only iphones",
            "Modern phone, fast & easy to use. Wanted a phone I can fit in my pocket as well which this does. Takes decent pictures.  Would recommend.",
            "Good option for overpriced apple products",
            "Great little phone. Easy to set up. Does everything you need from a phone.",
            "No problem with transferring data over from old mobile. \nGood replacement choice",
            "Most people that have iPhones tend to stick with them, I always have it’s a great phone and as I bought the red one a donation went to charity BONUS",
            "Was in need of a new mobile treat myself to something a little bit more expensive and classy. Bought phone outright rather than go for a contract.",
            "Needed a new phone for my niece who was heading back to University. Other places there would have been a tome lag. Argos stepped up to the mark and who process was seamless. One happy uncle and happier niece.",
            "Excellent phone for daily use",
            "I like iPhones but not the big prices.  I was upgrading from iPhone 7 to iPhone SE 2nd gen (2020) mainly because I wanted the dual sim feature so I don’t have to carry 2 phones (work & personal). Works a treat.  Was easy to get my personal O2 sim changed to eSim and then simply insert my work Sim (EE).  Both working together perfectly and IOS makes it simple to use.  Great camera too. Not 5G, but that’s ok for me. Buying from Argos locally was handy too, and at same good price.",
            "The do’s and don’t seem to make this entire process rather skewed.",
            "Fab phone! Slimmer and more slicker than the original SE! Would definitely recommend",
            "The camera on this phone is great and the battery life is much better than the iphone 7",
            "comes with a new style charging cable - which isn't USB port - so no longer works with all existing Apple plugs - but doesn't come with a new style plug",
            "Nice phone . I love this phone .\nI love Argos..",
            "I changed my old iPhone SE for this upgraded version. It performs well - the camera is great and the phone quality is good as expected with Apple products. Setting up was easy including the clever way data automatically comes across from my old phone. The only criticism is that it needs a different wall plug for faster charging (not in the box) but meantime still charges with the old lead and plug.  Otherwise highly recommended.",
            "Great phone - cheapest iPhone available however still pricey but an investment. Packed with tech and smallest in the range which I like. Looks great and just manageable with one thumb (sits in hand). Get a screen protector on it quick as the glass is scratchable.\nBattery power okay for all day if not watching film or music too much.",
            "Very good size, nice firm grip with one hand.\nAnd got the home button wich makes easy to do payments.\nHappy with the purchase",
            "Great phone for the price, does everything you'd need :)",
            "Runs really well, the camera is more then adequate, not as in depth as the expensive iPhone but it's quality is as good as it needs to be",
            "You'll are doing great job,keep it up",
            "Exactly the same as the iPhone 8 I had before, absolutely love it!",
            "Excellent phone at reasonable price, first processor excellent picture quality.\nHeadphone and charger plug doesn’t come, in box phone and charger cable only.",
            "This is a sim free phone, which means I can choose who I want as my provider and not stuck in a long contract. \nGreat and reasonably priced iphone it has a great camera front and back\nI was not a fan of apple but I am now",
            "Happy with this phone great upgrade from my iPhone 7",
            "Great phone, brand new & a very reasonable price - next day delivery & easy collection - Fabulous thank you!",
            "Love this phone so easy to use. A little gift to myself.",
            "Really love my new iphone se. I was looking to upgrade my old iphone & this is great. It's really lightweight and silmline, which is perfect for me. It was cheaper than other iphones on the market, but still has the same great features you expect to find with apple products. I have already recommended it to my brother and sister in law.",
            "Best budget phone from Apple",
            "The size of this phone is not too big or too small,handy and quite fast",
            "it’s a steal. If you’re thinking you should then you should",
            "Plenty of storage 128 gb. Easy to use",
            "Great phone for a great price ordered pickup friendly service",
            "Having had 3 years of good use out of my old iPhone SE and as my battery was beyond redemption I decided to replace the phone rather than just the battery. I am extremely pleased with the new iPhone SE 2020, very fast, and I decided to go for the 128k memory so I could download more and have more space for Apps. One word of warning make sure old phone and new phone are on same version of IOS (currently 14.4) or you will struggle to transfer all your old data to new phone.",
            "I bought it for my husband he loved it. Perfect size which he can put into his normal coat pocket. Would advise to buy if your looking for something simple and convenient for everyday.",
            "Good purchase. Quick service at collection point.",
            "Avoid buying phone from here at all cost. No one would take back the phone & it was faulty",
            "love the colour and i like the fact i still have a home button with a newer phone.",
            "it is something which is affordable for those of us who value a home button and dont want to pay a lo`t of money for an i phone.",
            "Replaced old se model for this one it is so much quicker at responding",
            "It’s so quiet good to be available a small item which have big idea and so much features",
            "Great phone got it as my original se finally gave up :( very impressed with this one also",
            "thanks so much thank younso much",
            "Kind and friendly service. All the transaction was quick and easy",
            "I had an i-Phone 6 before this. This new version is sooooo much faster than the old one, but the delightful thing for a Luddite like me is that the icons, etc., and ways of doing things are pretty much the same. So I don't have to unlearn how to make things work, which is a relief. Looks and feels like it means business too. Very pleased.",
            "This is the 4th SE I've owned & not disappointed\nSlightly larger size than previous models but for me a great phone at a reasonable cost",
            "Looks slick as it is shown on the web site, colour red looks fabulous iam really happy with the purchase,",
            "Well built phone, brilliant features. It is a present for the other half. Will be getting myself one too.",
            "great phone at a great price easy to use",
            "My old phone stopped working in lockdown and like many others, it is important to device to stay in touch with friends and family.  I needed a safe and convenient means to get the phone I wanted and the range of phones and the Covid safe click and collect service from Argos was ideal ... thanks.",
            "Replaced my iPhone 7 - practically identical in size (not a fan of massive phones) but much quicker and more reliable \n\nPlease note the charging cable does not come with a plug and is not compatible with previous Apple USB plugs - USB C plug required. Also, like the iPhone 7, no headphone Jack so you will need an adapter.",
            "A good camera, decent price, enough power and a lighter iPhone than recent models. Battery life could be better also no headphone jack.",
            "Bought for my son easy to use",
            "To me this phone is same size as iPhone 6s. Fits in same case. Screen has a lovely feel to it (shame that its going to have a protector on it) and screen super clear. As soon as I turned it on software started on it that was able to transfer all my information, apps over very slick, very Apple! So easy. Didn't even have to put my wifi passcode in. (Had to reset up banking apps, but all my apps loaded)",
            "I bought this after trying out an Oppo mobile phone. Definitely worth the purchase, camera is excellent for what I need it for.",
            "Bought as a replacement for an android phone. Great size for a pocket, with an incredible camera and masses of memory.",
            "great size for teenager. looks very nice\n camera quality not very good but expected",
            "Iphone SE Lovely in white. Small and lightweight. Easy of use",
            "Great iPhone a little bigger but a lot quicker than the older SE",

            "very happy with phone and price was great aswell works as it should",
            "I can see why apple is worth so much, they do make very high profits.\nIt was a present, so cost not an issue, daughter is very pleased with phone.\nHowever, I and the wife have Samsung phones. \n;-)",
            "It was great it came with everything included and the phone is working fine and it is really good and even when it came in the package it was very good and just like I bought it in the apple store.",
            "Really happy with the phone. Very good replacement for my iPhone 6.",
            "Bought to replace my iPhone 7 which got broken when I slipped on the ice\nBought the iPhone SE on the same day as I cannot be without a phone for my job\nExcellent service and fair price",
            "Excellent phone. with the high spec and great functionality you expect with Apple. Glad I went for 128 GB as it should last for a few years. It links seemlessly with my iPad and my Apple Music account. No regrets, excellent value for money vs the competition.\nTwo niggling issues; no output socket so I can’t output to my car stereo or home speakers. No plug provided (and it’s different to my last iPhone plug). This wasn’t made clear before and no option to purchase with the product.",
            "Brilliant phone, does what expected and has a few more upto date features on it compared to the old SE which i had",
            "This was purchased for my adult son as a replacement for his worn out  iphone 6.\nIt does everything needed and more.",
            "Great phone, good size, fits in pocket or small handbag. Does everything that i need it to do and lots of storage. Very happy with it.",
            "I needed a better mobile and I am really pleased with this.  The battery life is so much better and I am appreciating the extra storage.  I particularly like the portrait mode on the camera.",
            "It’s a good combination of form and functionality.",
            "Nice replacement of 7, good futures",
            "This phone is great,smal and comfortable with many extras",
            "Perfect IPhone , small but very fast",
            "It's a beautifully designed product, with the internals of the iPhone 11 in a case that will fit iPhone 7 and 8 covers. What's not to love really? Certainly my daughter was delighted enough, as she should be. For my money I'd take a entry level Samsung and buy a really nice pair of shoes with the change. But maybe that's just me :-)",
            "Great phone but the only downpoint is you pay so much for a phone only to end up with no charging plug.",
            "Prefer this smaller model, SE, to some of the new larger models. So far, very pleased with its performance.",
            "This phone has a very good battery which only needs charging once, maybe twice, a day. My old iPhone ran out of steam after short usage so I’m very pleased that the new SE is superior. It’s also a very handy size for my pockets - a must when walking my dog. Overall, a good purchase and would recommend it to friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nN",
            "Got this after my iPhone 6 slowed right down for simple tasks after the latest update. I just couldn’t bring myself to pay anymore for the 11 not the 12 especially some 5G roll out isn’t that wide yet. The SE fits the bill perfectly for working way better than my existing phone and being twice as easy on the wallet. Good stuff",
            "This is a super entry level iPhone. Really accessible price with very decent 128GB storage. Love the red as it’s that little bit different. This is the size of the iPhone 7 so a nice step up from the old SE, but not too large, so decent for my son to carry around with him at school. Has a good processor and very well made for the price. Don’t expect high end like XR etc, but really impressed with this iPhone.",
            "Big storage and good value",
            "Easy to use, uncomplicated iPhone with good memory size.  Reasonable price.  Battery life appears to be good so far.",
            "I thought I would treat myself to an new phone as I was getting fed up with my old iPhone 6s constantly needing charged. So far this phone has been great and it was very easy to set up without losing anything from old phone. Great purchase",
            "I am very happy with this phone",
            "All right, reliable phone so far. Next day delivery. The daughter is very pleased with the Christmas gift.",
            "Xmas present for my son working fine and he loves it",
            "Best OS there is, great phone, right size, good camera",
            "Had been having battery issues with my old SE for a while before it became unreliable. This was the cheapest new IPhone I could find to replace it and is perfect. Slightly bigger than the old SE, otherwise the same and an absolute joy to use. Old one lasted just over 3 years, hoping this one will too.\nWould definitely recommend.",
            "Its a mobile phone .",
            "Really easy to set up, good apps & controls",
            "Good value for money compared to the more expensive Iphone. Would recommend to anyone that doesn’t want to spend a fortune on a phone.",
            "Bought for my son he is well pleased",
            "I really can't say anything else about Iphone SE what it is. Perfect, comfortable to handle and to use that. I am going to buy one to my daughter even in the same colour, as well.",
            "I love this phone. I like the design.",
            "Great little phone at a fair price. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Well worth buying",
            "Do’s exactly what it should love the phone has it’s the same size has my iPhone 7 and the case fits from my old phone",
            "Bought this phone for my Father, it’s easy to use\nHas main button that’s  big help. He doesn’t like touch screen phone. Price was worth it as other sites price higher.  Had good reviews. Everything was fully packed. No damage to any of the items.",
            "Never had a smart phone. I am of the older generation. Wanted an up to date phone but not very large. This one fits my needs exactly. Small enough size and has the technology of a much larger recent iphone. Seems to take good enough photos. Easy to set up using my iPad to transfer data. Wish the battery lasted a bit longer, as everyone does! But wouldn’t put me off buying again Used my nectar points which reduced the cost.",
            "the purchase does everything that is asked of it and could probably do a lot more if one new how",
            "Great iPhone at a reasonable price. Battery life 10 times better than my old one.",
            "Iphone SE great speed with new app and downloading emails and information.\nPrice excellent",
            "I purchaced this iPhone on line through Argos,for my wife,the item arrived on time.\nBoth my wife and I are in our seventies and didn't relish setting the phone up or swapping the items from her old iPhone to the new,along came the granddaughter and did everything in a matter of minutes!\nThe phone is just as easy to use as her old one with lots of new features.",
            "Absolutely loving this phone, so much memory, feels great in your hand & the camera quality is great - You can film in 4K. I upgraded from a 16gb original SE to this & now I’m downloading all of the apps daily. I was initially worried about the bigger size of this phone but its not a problem. \n\nWas only slightly gutted when I opened the box & realised it doesn’t come with headphones or a plug & the charging cable is lightning to USBc not standard. I must have missed that in the description.",
            "Extremely excellent service love u argos u always sort out me according to my budget really appreciate ur help in hard times",
            "It’s a bit bigger than my old phone but perfect non the less. Easy to set up, great functions.\nBattery life seems good. Only downfall No headphones socket. If you want to use ordinary headphones you need an adapter. So if you need to charge you can’t listen. Air pods are expensive too.",
            "Chose iphone SE as it's smaller than most nowadays. It fits in my pocket and sits on my hand comfortably.",
            "This phone was bought with a view to updating my current Phone. \nThe performance is notably faster from the A13 chip and it has a great host of features. Really very easy to use and if you are transferring your data from an Older Iphone model set up is a breeze.\nExcellent build quality and with nice intuitive design and controls that deliver an excellent experience. \nWas a great price went for the 128GB model as it was best mix of storage and value for money.",
            "This model has all the features you would expect on an Apple phone including a long battery time.  It is very compact and fits well into a pocket or handbag.",
            "This phone is an ideal size for my needs.",
            "Really pleased with the phone. \nWanted a home key (not available with the 12)\nLots of features (still playing with it at the moment)",
            "In stock now reduced price All good",
            "Brilliant service and product was as specified!\nThe in store service was prompt and I received my phone the same day as ordering",
            "Perfect for a 'no frills' smartphone",
            "Good product for the price",
            "I bought this for my wife. She is so happy for the design and size. It’s camera and functions so good. Recommended.",
            "The phone looks smart and is a comfortable size to hold. I does everything needed for modern day living.",
            "Incredible price range for an apple product sharing similar specs to an Iphone 11. Performance and camera are seamless and superb. Touch ID is still a very valid alternative to face ID. Only fault is the battery which is rated at 1800mAh compared to other phones in the same price range having significantly larger battery. I can last a day from 100% to around 30% and given the phone sits in my pocket and is only used for around 30 mins with icloud, background refresh off it is disappointing.",
            "Brilliant phone, very fast, very easy to use & set up.",
            "Great phone. Gifted it to my father and he absolutely loved it. The customer service was great.",

            "Very good.  Does exactly what I need",
            "Good iPhone ,replaced my old SE for new one ,happy with purchase",
            "I like very much this phone, five stars .",
            "Great phone for the price. I prefer the smaller screen, and the phone runs smoothly with the new processor. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but if you aren't looking for the most recent model and want a smaller, cheaper option then this phone is perfect",
            "Stunned how easily it was to transfer data! No complaints with this phone, just so easy to use.",
            "Very dissapointed with the battery. For sure the phone is faulty. Bought this phone as it had dual sim. Haven't even used the 2nd sim wonder what will happen  if i use the second. Battery drains hardly using the screen. Having to carry another phone",
            "After a few teething problems found my new iphone easy to use. The battery is long lasting. The only tip I would suggest is to look up the instructions online before you attemp to use it.",
            "This was a good purchase and a good product to carry around. It is lightweight and compact to allow for easy handling. It hasn't overheated since purchase and the battery charges very fast. Overall this a great product and one that I think you should buy for a lower price.",
            "This would be a great phone if it rang when people call me but instead I will be returning it to store.",
            "Great phone reliable does everything i need it to really pleased with it and reasonably priced.",
            "What s great phone, looks cool, is fast and stylish. Great upgrade from there previous one. Also smallest smart phones you can get.",
            "I needed to upgrade my iPhone 6 but wasn't keen on some of the newer models because they are too big. Settled on this 2nd generation SE and was so glad I did. Easy to use and set up right out of the box. Excellent camera. Battery life not as good as I thought but I have been using my phone more while our internet is down so that might be why. Overall, highly recommend. Just remember to get a case as it's quite slippery without one.",
            "A very nice up grade phone for me with more of everything that I wanted and good value for money",
            "Would be great if Argos can provide a limited accidental damage cover",
            "I Thought it will be a bit better battery but finally its not so bad, better than my Pixel 2xl anyway. Its good for whole day actually, sometimes on the end of my day its still left 20%. Charging is fast and additionaly has a Qi charging what is great. Phone work fast and its a great size for me, grip even in case is good. Screen is smaller than any other phones has but for using by one hand its very comfy. \nI can highly recomended this iPhone especially Red :)",
            "Bought this as a present for my sister, haven’t given it yet but it has very similar specs to my iPhone 11 which I bought for almost twice the price so price wise it’s worth it.",
            "Good products . I very happy",
            "Needed a new phone but didn’t want anything too big or expensive. The iPhone se 2020 isn’t much bigger than the iPhone 5s. It works pretty much the same, so I’m very pleased with my purchase.",
            "The purchase of this phone was great, very easy. I bought it in one branch and collected it the next day in a branch closer to me. I was recommended this phone from a family member and the reviews for it look positive also. I’m very happy with my purchase!",
            "I’m very happy with IPhone SE very fast system,easy to use also nice design, I can recommend",
            "I believe some features such as arranging icons could be simplified",
            "This is the first phone for a good few years, I have liked the look of and I am not disappointed.",
            "Easy and efficient way to purchase products. I bought this for goddaughter from Australia, really appreciate being able to buy her something she really wanted from the other side of the globe. Will definitely make it easy to buy future presents. Thank you",
            "Got this as a Birthday present for our son who loves it, the size, speed, battery and features plus the 128g helps particularly with the youth of today.",
            "I purchased this to replace my 8 year old iPhone 4s. Having done a little research it was a no brainer and like the fact it’s not too big unlike many others. The battery life is absolutely incredible and far better than I ever expected. Even with a new sim ( nano instead of old micro) setting up only took a few minutes and synced to my iPad instantly with no loss of contacts etc. It even found my home Wi-fi from my cloud settings.",
            "I love this phone. It’s small enough to use one handed and fits in my pocket. It’s fast and looks great. I don’t think the battery life is as bad as some say. I use my phone a lot and still have around 30% left by the end of the day.",
            "Bought as a birthday present for my teenage daughter.She is happy despite the older  design as the phone is  upgrade from her previous iPhone 6 and has good specs . Battery life is OK but could be improved . I bought from Argos as had additional 10% offer on the day . Good bargain !",
            "Beautiful design, easy to use phone. But the battery doesn't last long",
            "The 2020 SE is a worthy upgrade to its predecessor with its A13 chip and IOS 14 software housed in an iPhone 6 sized package offering great value for money and upgrade-ability  at half the price of the iPhone 11. Yes it may not have the latest multiple lens camera and super high resolution screen but can still shoot 4K video and has the addition of portrait mode to the single lens camera. The battery is good for the whole day of normal use and the browsing is super fast.",
            "Needed a replacement for my ageing iphone 5S and this does the job terrifically - and more. All the usual features are there, plus extra ones. The iphone SE is familiar enough to previous incarnations so as to be easy to use - and it's not the size of a small tablet!",
            "I didn’t had much money to buy a new phone, but im glad i picked this one. \n\nI recommend buying a powercase for it, because it’s battery life isnt too good.",
            "Very happy with the purchase",
            "My I phone 6s came from Argos excellent service then, now upgrading to I phone SE2020\nDespite the present difficulties my store Crawley Sussex was open to collect,\nOrdered online and arrived at store gave details phone was there ready time spent under five minutes very efficient service will go again, why collect? All ways do if it’s a phone/tablet to check it’s the correct one it was.",
            "Very happy with my purchase. Like my IPhone 7 but faster.",
            "Great phone easy to use",
            "Ready for pick up within 6 hours",
            "Excellent phone, has all the features that had been described, very satisfied",
            "I bought the new IphoneSE2020 as wanted a small phone to put in my pocket, this the latest Iphone with all the latest spec packed in a small size slim phone so fits the bill just right!  Would highly recommend if you are looking for a reasonable priced Iphone with all the latest updates",
            "Very pleased with my Apple product, the build quality is 2nd to none, does everything that I ask of it run my TV and Computer from my unlimited download.\nI always try to buy from Argos so easy to purchase products from, and if you have a problem take it back to the store, I have always found their staff very polite and helpful top store.",
            "Best phone i ever had, very good quality, i love it",
            "The phone is good quality with the up-to-date iPhone 11 chip inside as well as having the old features of the button on the front of the phone as it is good for my wife who is not used to the new way of sliding up and down on the phone.\nSome of the apps can be confusing however the phone is good quality for the price",
            "All the features what I’m looking is all here in iPhone se2020. \nHighly recommended this product.",
            "Love the phone and it’s very easy to use.",
            "Perfect phone for day to day use.",
            "This phone ticks every box for me. A fabulous price for a fabulous phone.",

            "Value for money nice phone",
            "Great replacement for the iPhone 6 super fast and battery lasts a while",
            "Really happy, and was really easy to set up",
            "Birthday present for my daughter who absolutely loves it.\nIt was ordered relatively late on the day before the birthday so as to stop the snooping for presents. It was a little gamble as I opted for same day delivery so I was pleasantly surprised Argos were willing to deliver into the evening, fantastic service, very pleased.",
            "Perfect budget phone from Apple. Love it so much.",
            "Very good phone.Bought it as a birthday present for my son. Already recommended to  our friends & they bought it!Plus got a headset free from Samsung!Brilliant!",
            "It’s an Apple product so expect everything to work exactly as it should. Very fast, nice change from bigger handsets. Only problem is the battery, it is BAD bring a charger or power bank with you.",
            "Good value and looks amazing",
            "Considering this is the most basic iPhone it’s still powerful and feature rich. More than happy with it",
            "Best iphone available for good value and features at a good price for 128 gb",
            "Its the same as an iphone 8 shell but with the  new chip A13 bionic chip. Battery life is good but not extra like what the adverts say . Its almost the same as battery life as any of the other previous Iphones",
            "Great camera with stability control to stop picture shake and very good resolution. To be honest even though the SE is much cheaper than other IPhones it has all the quality and gadgets you would expect from Apple. Battery life is very good, screen resolution excellent and for a saving of £200.00  what’s not to like! Was replacing an IPhone 6S and this does the job admirably and very happy with my purchase.",
            "Well worth the money great iPhone I bought this phone as my other iPhone was too old and I needed a replacement and this is ideal for the price and it came out in April 2020",
            "It’s good not too big and wide like other mobile phones it’s Apple very reliable and resistant to problems safe from troubles and very good for the price",
            "I get a lot of features on this iPhone without having paid the high price for a new model",
            "Looks good value for money",
            "i love this phone its superb . my dreams come true .",
            "Great phone small but not too small lots it gb to store stuff battery life not that great but last the day if you’re not playing games but for day to day used good happy with me purchase and Service through the Argos store thanks",
            "this is my latest iphone it’s better then first generation and it’s really good picture \nbrilliant phone",
            "Good camera\nGreat battery\nClear display",
            "Bought this iPhone for my son, who appears to love it.",
            "logical replacement for an old SE better features and great battery life",
            "The battery on this is terrible. It functioned like my old iPhone 6 that was constantly losing battery even after a new battery was replaced. The home button feels clunky. Genuinely disappointed. If you do want a budget iPhone then make sure to buy a few chargers as you'll need them. I couldn't use this phone for even half a day without it losing battery life. Felt like a dodgy broken phone. The screen is also far too small if you use it to watch Netflix/you tube etc. Good points? Fast browser.",
            "This phone has surpassed all my expectations. It may be at a more budget friendly price but it packs the features of a high end phone.",
            "It's an iPhone and works as an iPhone. It's rather small compared to my 6plud bit that needed updating so here I am with a faster iPhone. The software is up to date and I'm impressed with the swipe texting. It has basic cameras but I'm not a photographer so am not bothered FaceTime and such still work fine",
            "I needed a new phone so decided to go for the iPhone SE loved the size which is not as big as other iPhones So easy to use very pleased",
            "The new iphone SE is a step change, Apple doing what it does best, better. A user friendly, fast feature packed phone at a price point that’s good for many.",
            "I am really happy with the purchase, the battery life, camera, and other functions are excellent for the lower price = highly recommended!",
            "It was an excellent iPhone and transfer of data from old iPhone was a doddle just put it next to old phone and a few minutes later all done. As a gift for my wife she is well pleased.",
            "a nice phone i like it.",
            "Brilliant- it’s an iPhone!",
            "The iPhone SE is a good size phone. It’s features are good classic Apple.  Easy to use.  Camera is fantastic.  I love the red colour ❤️",
            "Great phone, Lovely size in my hand and also the camera takes great pictures and videos. It has everything i need to keep in contact and do the things i need",
            "I Love this phone!!!",
            "Great phone. Same size as my iPhone 7 which is great as fits in pockets nicely. Everything else superb as you would expect from Apple. 128gb should last me some time now ! I did plenty of research online before deciding on the model. The price is much more attractive than some of The other models so I’m very happy with my new iPhone SE.",
            "Red phone replacing old same model that camera stopped working due to rain damage. This is better in wet weather. Photos are great sound output is surprisingly loud. Music is a lot better than before too. All in all very happy...",
            "This iPhone SE was a direct replacement for my previous older generation iPhone SE.  Built in functionality to switch from  old to new phone was successful, but took longer and more input from me than last time. Phone slightly bigger than old one but, Battery life slightly better for now. Difficult to say exactly why, but camera does seem better than old one.  No major \"wow\" moments, but the phone does seem to be a generally \"better\" version of my old SE (better battery, screen, camera, storage)",
            "Good price but very small",
            "Great value replacement for an old iphone 6",
            "Briliant phone, good quality",
            "Fantastic, it was a nice product with clear photo shoot.",
            "Otherwise excellent phone. I’m usually an Apple supporter, but the performance is spoilt by very poor battery life. The Iphone 2020 has a shorter battery life than my 3 year old Iphone SE, and I do not use my phone a great deal. \n\nScreen size, and camers is much better than the old SE.",
            "Needed to update my mobile. Chose to do it via Argos. Glad I did. So easy and quick to get what I wanted.",
            "Great size and quality phone! Not too big so still easy to handle with one hand when being a parent or person on the go! Camera and photo quality is superb! iPhones are the best!! Get one!",
            "Good phone in the mid price range. I would buy a case as it’s design means it can slip from hands.",
            "Excellent phone to replace my old I phone. Impressed with the quality of camera. The right sized phone for my pocket.",
            "Bought this for my fiancee as a replacement for her 5se. So far she's extremely happy with it.",

            "fab phone prompt delivery a very smart device",
            "Great phone at a brilliant price and as my wife did not want a bigger screen this fits the bill nicely.\nIt has the same chip as the iPone 11 so is very fast and she is really impressed with it.",
            "Perfect to carry with one hand. Elegant design and reasonable price. What’s not to like?!",
            "Needed a new mobile and as my previous one was Apple I went for the same.  Love the red colour and more than happy with my choice.",
            "It's lovely to hold and the scrolling is superbly smooth - almost tactile!",
            "Good quality good price",
            "By far the best Covid distancing store I’ve been in felt safe and all the staff polite",
            "I'd like to have waited for the iPhone 12, but needed a new phone.\n\nBuying the iPhone SE (2020) - was never going to be an earth-shattering experience. The size, form factor and appearance are identical to the 6S, so the usual degree of excitement was muted. However, it's a familiar and trusted interim until the newest model arrives on the scene.\n\nThe SE isn't going to rock your world, but if you're looking for a cheap(-ish) iPhone, this will undoubtedly do most everything you need.",
            "Really happy with my purchase. Was better than I thought it would be . Value for money",
            "Great phone for the money, not much difference to models twice the price to be honest.",
            "The phone is in good quality. It works very well. I recommend it to everyone.",
            "Pleased to have a new phone that isn’t the size of a brick! Most modern iPhones are physically too big.",
            "Great product from Apple at good price.",
            "I brought this handset for the hubby as he needed an upgrade from his old iPhone 5s and wanted a similar device that had to be apple. It was the best combination of price and quality with the features he wanted",
            "I bought this to replace my iPhone 6. It looks, feels and works just the same as far as I’m concerned just a bit faster and will be supported by future iOS updates  (which is exactly what I wanted from it) both front and rear cameras have also been updated.\nProtective cases designed for iPhone 7/8 fit this phone.\nThe one downside so far (I have only had it a week) is the battery life, if you are a heavy user it won’t last to the end of the day.",
            "Great phone for a great price. Looks great in white.",
            "Perfect size for me, so much better than the old SE. The only thing I would change is a better camera with a wide angle option. Panoramic is too much",
            "Bought it as a present, nice design, very good camera! Highly recommend",
            "After having an iPhone 7 for 3.5 years I was due something new. Preferring the smaller phone I chose the iPhone se 2020. Great phone. With a lot of the intervals of the iPhone 11 Pro. For a fraction of the price ! Very happy :)",

            "I had an I phone 6 and it was battered I needed a new phone and Argos was so quick at dispatching and I can pay over 6 months. \n\nGreat phone easy to transfer all my apps and  passwords over to the new phone. 10/10",

I love the quality of the camera too and the general feel of it. I'm not one for these bigger phones so this fits perfect for me.
