Bad design feature from the geeks who let this go out . Battery life I like to see outa 0 -100 personally. \n The Geeks & Bosses blamed again for not finding space for Battery percentage. Guys c-mon the age of tech & we are guessing ??",

            "Great upgrade from my iPhone 7 Plus! Cheaper than buying from Apple and I could pick it up within minutes. Good work Argos",
            "Recently upgraded my phone and thought I'd stick with iPhone, not sure it was the best decision! Its easy to use but for me too big and too heavy. Probably the biggest sticking point for me is no finger print unlock, it has face id but i much prefer the finger print option or have the choice of both. Also with the description saying dual sim i was expecting to be able to put 2sim cards in which isnt true, the 2nd sim is a esim. Still a good phone if you can deal with size and weight",

            "It was a great shop that I did itâ€™s awesome",
            "Good purchase so far! Only thing to consider is that it is â€˜fatterâ€™ and heavier than the XS.",
            "Really like this phone. Easy to use, great photo and video quality and a long battery life.",
            "Great change from my 6s+ \nA little bit smaller in size but full screen, without border, is better. \nChanges in settings to make and a small learning curve to get to know the phone. Great now Iâ€™ve I know. videos on YouTube help with advice on how to change settings for personal use. \nI recommend getting a protective case as it is so smooth and slippery without. Plenty of choices for see through covers so phone colour is seen. \nStraightforward to transfer data and apps over to the new phone.",
            "Got this phone a few days ago and itâ€™s better than expected,the battery life is awesome,itâ€™s lightweight and features are great,would recommend it to anyone,move contacts and Data with ease,\nOver the moon",

            "This phones definitely the best one Iâ€™ve had, Kobe the colour itâ€™s so vibrant",
            "Purchased to replace a 6S which had an unfortunate accident. I opted for the XR due to the available storage which at 128GB is plenty for my music and photos. After much deliberation between this and the XS, I felt storage was far more important than the extra, high cost for the look, OLED screen, camera and minor speed increase of the XS. I do struggle without a home button and really wish Apple would find a way to re-enable Touch ID. Using Apple Pay can be a pain when relying of Face ID.",
            "This was an upgrade from an iPhone 7, and the difference is incredible. The camera is far better, the screen is a massive improvement, and the face recognition just works as it's supposed to. Far better than the old fingerprint reader. It's a great phone!",
            "Well built and smart looking phone with all the features one would expect. Battery life so much better than previous models.",

            "Phone is fantastic, I have been with apple for years now and im really pleased with this model.",

            "Keep it up \nstaff is good and genuine",
            "Love this phone. Its the best choice. Iâ€™ve tried android phones but always come back to iOS. This is the perfect size if you want a bigger phone but only have smaller hands. The colours are all great so it was difficult to pick but am so happy with the coral. Battery life is awesome it can last a day and a half without charge with full use. Iâ€™m a commuter so I watch a lot of videos or listen to music for hours each day and never have to worry about it going flat. Would recommend to anyoneâ€™",

            "This phone doesnâ€™t disappoint. It has a great screen, is very quick at everything it does. Face ID is very quick, quicker than Touch ID. Everything just seems quicker and smoother. I would highly recommend it.",
            "amazing phone, especially battery life!",
            "I bought this for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it and so far has no complaints which is amazing for a teenage girl!!",
            "HEAVY COMPARE TO 6 PLUS, POOR SCREEN QUALITY, BATTERY TAKES AGES TO CHARGES, BAD DISPLAY QUALITY",

            "Very good iPhone great features on this model, superb screen size long battery life.\nChose yellow colour myself but they do other lovely colours.",
            "This iPhone XR is clearly the best phone in the x range. It has all the features of the top model minus the OLED screen & at a lower price.\nItâ€™s a nice looking iPhone but I still invested in a good case to protect my iPhone.",
            "Fantastic phone, which is the perfect",
            "Everyone should have this phone itâ€™s the best out there",

            "This phone does exactly what I need and for only Â£50 more it holds more storage. No more notifications that your memory is full. To charge it takes minimal time unlike other phones and the battery life last me at least a day and a a half when fully charged. I use it quite a lot as well. The camera quality is superb and my pictures look so much better now. Very happy with this purchase and defiantly the right choice for me.",
            "I have an iPhone X and when you consider the specs of this phone, you would think itâ€™s not worth it but when you put it side to side you realise the size is better and the screen quality actually looks great. The camera is better, the phone is faster and the battery life is so much better along with a quicker Face ID. It makes you wonder a lot as to what this cheaper model offers that is better in many departments to an iPhone X, very attractive indeed.",

            "Bought this to replace my aging 6s which although still works great, the battery life was suffering and draining fast. So, bought this to replace it. Initially wanted the Xs Max but couldnâ€™t stand the cost. This handset is a perfect compromise between features and cost compared to the XS models, amazing battery life (2 days on one charge), great camera, great screen, 128gb means storage adequately covered for a few more years. \n\nAll in all I would recommend - yellow is the best colour! ;D",
            "Had to buy this my son due to him being mugged and attacked and having his stolen I felt why shouldnâ€™t he have what he works for he was happy with the first phone so replaced with the same",
            "Upgraded from iPhone 7 and must say I love the phone. Battery life is amazing, screen is great.\nTook a while to get used to itâ€™s size, itâ€™s pretty big and itâ€™s also quite heavy.\n\nBut all in all an amazing device and Iâ€™m so glad I bought it.",
            "Itâ€™s the first new phone I had since the 6 so Iâ€™m very happy with it",
            "A great Apple product and does exactly what you expect - not top of range but still excellent",
            "Absolute joy of a phone a great upgrade and a very nice experience with Argos!",
            "My partner is happy with this new phone I was so impressed Iâ€™m purchasing another for myself being an iPhone 6s Plus owner,",
            "Phone a bit too big To comfortably hold, however it is a great phone. Battery life lasts forever.",
            "Was a present too my Grandson   15 years old he thinks its an amazing phone , (  the phrases he uses most adults would not understand LOL )",
            "I love this phone!!!! It was such a good choice I have no regrets, saved Â£100 or so buying this out right! \nLong term much better",
            "The latest I phone great",
            "Best and lovely,perfect for game",
            "Lovely phone looks great nice colour bought for my son and he loves it",
            "Over the years I have had many iPhones from 4 to 6 and now the XR\nFantastic battery life\nEdge to edge screen with fantastic colour range\nAnd facial recognition really is a must and with Apple Pay is so much easier \nThe iPhone XR is by far the best for quality and functionality over any other iPhone.",
            "Iphone xr looks and feels great..very responsive.\nGood camera quality\nUpdates fast",
            "Upgraded after 2 Â½ years with and iPhone 7. \nMuch faster at absolutely everything. Camera is massively improved and the large screen makes a big difference when watching movies. \n\nFace ID is excellent - very easy to setup and works flawlessly. \n\nBattery life is superb - getting nearly 2 days of decent usuage (1 1/2 hour morning and 1 1/2 evening commutes with heavy usage + gym etc)\n\nWould recommend to anyone looking for a new phone especially if youâ€™re upgrading from an iPhone 8 or older.",
            "Simple and easy to use",
            "This iPhone is just as good as all the reviews I have read suggest. It's fab!",
            "Best phone out there",
            "I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it so much.",
            "Absolutely amazing worth the price",
            "So the phone is what made my life much easier with technology and when i move around its more accessible with the face id and would recommend it more than the xs.",
            "Battery life great! Get 2 days+. Like the Face ID. Bought to replace 6s. Happy with it. :)",
            "Another beautiful phone",
            "Husband Super happy with this phone. He loves the screen size as he reads a lot from his phone and the battery life is amazing.\n\nHad a brilliant experience with ordering from Argos. Itâ€™s so easy reserving in store and great experience to collect when ready. Just so straight forward and fuss free!",
            "Itâ€™s a lovely mobile and itâ€™s easy to use",
            "Battery lifeâ€™s amazing can go all day without needing charge would deffo recommend",
            "Wonderful phone and wonderful service",
            "Christmas gift for myself great features. Iâ€™ve upgraded from an I phone 6. I would say if your thinking of buying one then donâ€™t hesitate BUY IT",
            "Very nice phone right size",
            "Ä°t is real good and nice",
            "Very nice good quality nice and slim Loving it",
            "The XR is a Great phone itâ€™s very quick. The new functionality is very easy to get used to. \nThe battery life is Phenomenal, I now charge my phone when I feel like it instead of as soon as I see a power source. \nIt totally slipped my mind when did we all become Left Handed? If you try to use the new iPhones in your right hand you will have an instant dislike to the controls. \nItâ€™s a Fantastic iPhone and I love it.",
            "Amazing product, very happy with it\nGreat specs better screen quality, and wider screen.",
            "Good mobile but little bit heavier and thicker compare to similar range Android phones.",
            "Good phone does what it says on the tin",
            "Really happy with the phone, quick and easy to order and collect, perfect.",
            "After not owning a iPhone since 2nd gen 3G decided to try one after having loads of problems with android auto . fixed all my problems havenâ€™t found anything negative to say about this phone so go buy it now itâ€™s great",
            "iPhone XR blue! Wow the best iPhone Iâ€™ve ever had I had iPhone 8plus & I did not like it at all. Thankyou Argos",
            "The new XR is not quite as slim and light as I would have liked but that is partly down to it having a glass back for wireless charging. The screen is very good and I doubt if I would be able to pick out much difference with the more edxpensive OLED model. The pricier phones do have a dual camera and force touch but I preferred to pay a bit less. Losing the home button and using Face ID is good progress in my experience.",
            "After using an iPhone 6 the IPhone XR is a a great upgrade.excellent battery life and a larger screen being the 2 major improvements for me.",
            "Very nice phone. A bit bulky but ok if one wants a big screen.",
            "I have XS max & I gifted XR to my mum. \nHonestly, I find XR to be much more worth for money. \nOnly huge difference I find in the phone is 3DTouch. \nRest both phones are exactly the same. \nAlthough, XS has 2 back cameras but frankly I didnâ€™t see massive difference between the 2. Itâ€™s kinda similar quality. \nI would have gone for 2 XR â€˜s if I had brought XR first. \nThe screen size for XR is just right, not too big not too small. \nIf u want a new Iphone, go for XR without any hesitation.",
            "Fantastic phone what more can I say",
            "In terms of performance for day to day use I havenâ€™t noticed much of a speed difference, apps open and close just as quick on my 7 as the XR.   Thereâ€™s no 3D Touch as there was on the 7, but I rarely used this feature so not a loss for me. You can still use the keyboard to move the cursor around like 3D Touch. No fingerprint scanner on the XR but the Face ID is just amazing.  It unlocks so fast from just tapping to wake the screen, and sliding my finger up to unlock.  Best iPhone Iâ€™ve owned!",
            "Better than the overpriced XS!  Does what I need it to do, and... a numberpad is included, where I can press some numbers then talk to someone!",
            "Itâ€™s almost identical to the much more expensive Xs and Xs Max.\nAll the same features, the same A12bionic chip inside. \nSlightly different screen but still top class\nGreat camera and the best battery in any iPhone ever. I mean this battery is INSANELY GREAT!\nAlso - colours. Pick a colour :)\nFor a phone thatâ€™s at least Â£250 cheaper itâ€™s an amazing upgrade especially if youâ€™ve been rocking a 6,7 or 8.",
            "Bought this instead of the other very costly iphones love the set up of apple so easy to use the screen is so much bigger and brighter than before battery life so far is fantastic camera has the portrait mode which i wanted and is great and takes really nice photos would recommend this phone",
            "Very stylish and great value",
            "The battery last days,",
            "Much better battery life than any other iPhone Iâ€™ve used. Lasts 2 days. I am also really impressed with the low light photography. It is definitely better than any other iPhone prior to X. Colours are accurate. Canâ€™t fault the camera.\n\nGood size phone. Slightly smaller than the older plus models. Nice variety of colours to choose from. \n\nI think this is a seriously good phone. Highly recommended.",
            "Just fantastic phone",
            "Phone is great and works well. Screen is bright and easy to use. Battery life is brilliant, would definitely recommend this"
