            "The phone itself is very good, responsive and easy to use. My only real gripe is some of the apps that automatically installed, like Tik Tok. I would ike to be able to choose if I want these apps or not. Overall pleased with how the phone is performing.",
            "Brilliant phone can't say enough about the price off the phone in relation to the tech u get for ur money, this phone by Samsung is bye far a winner in every especk",

            "Great phone with lots of really good features, camera is excellent as is the battery. The phone does have a few problems I found  -- trying to take a screenshot you really need three hands, for some reason all my apps icons disappeared and some pages turned black, I've been unable to put that right. Despite a few problems it's been good and reliable",

            "Amazing 1080p display, dark blacks, bright whites, hdr and oled is rly easy on the eyes. All the cameras are great, you can't notice any lack of quality on a 27inch monitor and macro camera is an amazing feature more than a quirky gimmick",

            "Lovely phone,  light and slim brilliant camera screen shot a bit difficult when you are trying to do it , but in all would recommend it",
            "Not a great phone, complicated process to turn the device on and off, which you have to do regularly due to the device having issues, ie not being able to send and receive calls, freezing etc, I use screen capture a lot and it is very difficult to do on this device, it only works in about 1 in 3 attempts as you have to press 2 buttons at once but if it detects one button being pressed first it does that command, its not me as the function worked perfect on an s8, screen is not a responsive either, can't wait for my contract upgrade.",
            "Extra memory is good to store all the photos I am enjoying taking",

            "The phone is amazing!!!",
            "I have had this phone for just over a month and haven't had many problems with it.\nThe only criticism would be the speed, if you have too many apps open at the same time it lags.\nI am a courier and will have my sat nav app running along with my delivery app. The delivery app uses the camera for proof of delivery and takes ages to take a photo with the other two apps running.",
            "Is a very good phone, and I have since been recommending it to people.",
            "On receiving mobile i noticed when picked up out box it had a recovery app message still on it....i took back 2 shop and they agreed that it was a used fone and returned fraudulently..i was not happy...offered a refund or other mobile...i took other mobile but wasnt even giving a apology for hassle of returning 2 store twice...once to return mobile and again to pick other one up...now im worried that the phone may have been hacked and my data is out there for all to see",

I purchased the a10 phone a while ago, and fell in love, deciding to an upgrade with Samsung was a no brainer, but choosing the right one was a difficult decision! This phone has everything: A reasonable price, a sleek, modern, design, an AMAZING high quality camera eith additional features that you will struggle to find elsewhere and great storage. 100% recommend.",

            "Great phone I think better than a iphone",
            "Love the phone, but 8 months later discovered that I can no longer take phone calls unless put on loud speaker. (apparently this is a fault with this model, if you check online) Tried all the tests and my only option now is to factory reset before I most likely have to return to be fixed. Concerned as I need my phone to work from home.  Starting to not like my decision to spend this amount of money on a new phone.   Would normally recommend this phone as up until now I loved this phone. But 8 months down the line to have this fault when I hardly use the phone to make or take phone calls, is ridiculous.",

            "Great device at a good price. Easy fast store collection. Fab service, thanks.",
            "The Argos in Redditch has abhorrent staff, phones fine tho!",
            "Love my new phone a51",
            "Great phone, it is sleek, just the right size, great camera for the price.  The only issue is that the sound is very tinny and I have to turn the volume low to make it less annoying when I have it on loudspeaker.",
            "My S7 edge completely died on me. Was able to transfer all my data and apps over which took an hour so made it alot less stressful than i thought.\n128gb compared to 32gb on the S7 edge is nice too.",

            "If you want a CHEAP and somewhat cheerful phone then this is the one for you. Other than that do not buy this phone! It was great at first couldn't fault the phone but after a while it started overheating apps started freezing, you open stuff and it crashes to a close straight away. The phone is simplistic to use, camera quality is good and the screen size is good but thats about it. A phone suitable for a young adult/teenager",
            "Delighted with my new phone.  I think the quality is excellent for the price.  I have always purchased a Samsung phone, it does everything I need in a phone.",
            "A good phone for the price.  It was easy to set up, I did have to look online how to change some of the settings, things like get rid of bixby because I couldn't figure it out. And things like the thumb scanner don't work that great, but its not to much of an issue for me.",
            "I found the phone so easy to use. The camera quality is greatly",
            "Absolutely awful, I can't give a bad enough review for how bad this phone was. \nNOT good phone, fingerprint reader never worked, worked maybe one time out of every 20.\nBluetooth kept dropping.\nAll in all the worst phone I have ever owned!",
            "Orderered this phone and within half an hour was ready to be collected, excellent service! \n\nReally good phone and easy to set up! I have upgraded from the A41. Only thing I would say is that I prefer the finger print unlock to be on the back like my previous phone, but not the end of the world.",
            "Purchasing was super easy, the box was pristine when collected and my son is very happy with it as it’s a good all rounder. He upgraded from a lower model and this is a definite improvement from operating system to screen size and more. We were able to set up the phone easily by transferring data across phones via WiFi and it comes unlocked so accepted his nano sim just fine. It’s an exact copy of his old one, but better!",
            "A fantastic phone with good value for money, excellent camera picture quality both indoor and outdoor. It runs all my apps smoothly.",
            "It's a good product. I recommend it to buy. It's like as shown in the picture. Good quality.",
            "Although not the cheapest price it was genuine UK stock and ready next day for collection.\nMeets my needs of a well fearured phone but with none of the hype that goes with the more expensive flagship models. Have always had a good reliable product from Samsung.",
            "I bought as a gift to my stepbrother, he really enjoyed it, the quality is good, the camera could be better, but have everything he needs.",
            "Great improvement on my old S7 Edge. The user interface and screen are much better. Has all the features that I will ever need being one of the older generation.",
            "bought to replace my old phone, for the price, OMG amazing. Easy to set up, sim free, nice to hold, camera is perfect in fact my mam has much newer model with the same mg camera! does far to much to mention. Look, just garb a bargain! Thanks Argos.",

            "A very good phone , does all I want and has a decent size screen.",
            "Good memory and responsive.  Fingerprint recognition not as good as expected and only 3 can be stored (also took a lot of effort for mine to be recognised).\nCamera very good but surprised at limited functionality (no time lapse or star trails for instance).",
            "I have always had Samsung phones and it was so easy to set up my new phone using Smart Switch. It is a good size with a really clear screen and I can now read my ebooks much more easily . It has a good size memory and is perfect for browsing, photography, social media plus all the apps I use for work.",
            "Great value for money and simple to use ! I had an Iphone before this and this one is way better. The camera quality is great and you have loads of storage. Definitely recommend!",

            "It is not sings are upto date with make Sony mobile \nIf l have a chance  return A51, l prefer do.\nMost  of software in A51 not similar with Sony mobile also cameras difficult to operate. \nThe battery capacity is poor too",
            "After spending a great deal of time and many deliberations I decided to purchase the Samsung A51.\nOrdering and collection was swift and picked it up the same day.\nThe phone is everything I need, smooth operation, plenty of memory for apps, camera which produces great images.\nHighly recommend.",
            "I got this phone as my android was playing up and was on its way out...I had to return it due to it being faulty when I was on the phone people sounded like E.T. anyway Argos was a babe in the return. \nBut honestly my experience with Samsung is I rather not lol... Like they don't even have a music folder you need to buy music... Imagine -_-! I know you need to buy music on iPhone but you can put music on to your phone via laptop you can't even do that WITH THIS PHONE THERE IS NO MUSIC FOLDER",
            "I am not in need of all the latest techno gimickry and this phone does all I need. The only small reservation is the battery life is not as good as I would have expected - last around a day and a half - given I don't stream,GPS or other battery draining uses.",

            "Very good phone,any problem easy to use, recommendable",
            "The A51 is a really good phone. Plenty memory for storage and the screen is excellent as is the camera. It also scrolls well. Some reviews said that battery life was not good but this may be due to the brightness setting being retina burning out of the box. If you back the brightness to a reasonable level battery life shouldn't be a problem.",
            "It's not for me Fingerprint scaner doesn't work Face recognition works intermitanly The things I want on a phone are not included such as being able to lock a message so you can't delete it accidently Looks nice easy to use but not for me",
            "It is a very lovely device, I am so glad I purchased it. It actually meets my exact needs, the only challenge though is with the fingerprint. Apart from that I love and will recommend it.",

I've always had samsung phones but I had my last one for 4 years and it was getting pretty tired, so to get this phone was a great upgrade as it's super fast, has an amazing camera, battery lasts for days and it has everything I need on it! I would definitely recommend.",

            "This generation A51 leaves much to be desired, the cameras do not help at all, I owned phones with much weaker cameras but which took better pictures.\nWhen using the phone more intensely\n \"such as photo editing, sending emails, writing messages ... it has delays in action!!!\nAt this price there are many other options!!!\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!",

            "The many apps and features are a bit overwhelming but just need time getting used to. Used to a smaller handset so it feels massive and delicate, but most come in these sizes now - would recommend a case. Design is attractive and visuals are highly customisable. Initial use has been quite intuitive, just need to be learned thoroughly as not had phone for long. Not much to go on in supplied user guide but you can get one from the Samsung website easily, which is clear to follow.",

            "Can't fault it. Swapping  over the apps from old phone to new was a breeze. Same for contacts  and photos.  Great screen , great battery and lots of GPS.\nTap twice to wake up, fingerprint  touch and your off.",
            "You can't ask much more from a mid-range phone. Smart switch moves everything from your old phone seamlessly. It's like having your old phone on your new phone. The camera was not too easy to get used to, you have to go into camera settings to add zoom to your volume buttons. I still don't know if there is a zoom control on the screen. It's still a great phone.",

            "Nice phone. Just what I was looking for",
            "Nice phone for the money. Has some nice features. Brought as an upgrade for my 70 year old mom. She has no problem using it having had an older model. Worth a purchase.",

            "For: \n- Great battery \n- Great camera/s\n- Great screen resolution\n- Great price\n\nAgainst:\n- Front 'punch hole' camera is just weird\n- Plastic side buttons feel like they could sink in permanently with each next press\n- 5g, no 5g, no noticeable difference.",
            "Thought I would move away from iPhone for something more affordable. Have ended up getting a refund for this and going back to apple!  \n\nBattery life is shocking after only a month of use, doesn't last until end of day now. WiFi constantly has issues and you have to turn WiFi on and off to get it to work.  Camera crashes all the time.  It just doesn't seem to like apps at all, so slow and laggy. Really slow to respond in general so you end up wondering if you've actually tapped it and end up double tapping and ending up in a fight with the phone. Fingerprint sensor is HORRIFIC and hardly ever works. Camera is terrible in low light and even in normal daylight has awful focus issues unless you're right in front of it.  People keep telling me my phone is switched off and calls go to voicemail when it is on and literally sat right next to me. No swipe feature to go back and forth on browsers so if you accidentally swipe back, which you will with this flipping thing, you lose your place completely and have to start again. \n\n Really wish I had listened to all the reviews before I bothered with this one!",
            "The A51 is a good mid range phone that does what it says on the box. Actually the box doesn't say much, but it is a good easy to use phone, it's fast and the battery lasts all day, a full charge takes about 3 hours, but that's while the phone is also being used. The camera is amazing, the quality of the photos is superb, with several different modes.\nThe quality of the audio is also excellent, music reproduction is amazing.\nAnyone buying this phone will be delighted with it.",

            "I had the A50 before this A51, after loosing my A50 I would have been happy with another A50 but Argos only had the A51 so went for that, its basically the same phone with a better camera.",

            "Great phone good price",
            "I have had Samsung phones previously, but this one is the best yet for photo clarity and memory space. Great value. Also this has a larger screen than my previous phones, a stylish and slender-looking phone.",

            "Great phone love that it charges super fast and the camera features are great. The fantastic large screen much clearer than my old Samsung \njust love it.",
            "I think for the price point you can find better. UI is fine, it's slower than I expected having read the reviews, camera is very nice but audio quality is low, volume is really low and Bluetooth doesn't work well at all",
            "Great phone at a fraction of the price you would pay for the \"S\" class.\n\nEasy to set up and comes with a good camera and a clear screen.  Works well with Android Auto.\n\nI struggled a bit to connect it to a pc, to allow me to transfer photos and music but I managed it eventually.",

            "camera is amazing great phone",
            "overall really happy with the A51. Its about the same size as the old phone but the display is bigger due to no bezels. Just easier and a much more pleasant experience  to use day to day. If you view photos side by side the S6 is just a bit better due to the screen resolution  being slightly  sharper. I thought this was going to be an issue but after a few days of use it really isn't.  When you think about the difference in cost to the S20 plus I am so glad with my choice. Faster, easier to handle and a much improved user experience  overall.",
            "A good phone in this price range",

            "I'm super happy with my new phone. I was looking for a good and modern phone, being the camera my main focus. The phone is super fast, responsive and the pictures are really incredible. The only thing im not impressed with is the batery - normally it lasts around 9 hours. However i do use my phone all day to work, with data on. Fast charging - around 60 minutes for 100%.",

            "When I first opened the box it was like I was transported to a future time where phones are beautiful and easy to use a time where your phone can talk to you can let you know what the weather is going to be like tomorrow its witchcraft I tell you! Witchcraft!! I can take photos using only the palm of my hand! The future is bright the future is.. no no sorry every little hel.. no sorry again can't remember the argos tag line so how about this one.. Don't argue argos it!.. If used I want £5000",

            "The fingerprint reader is inferior to the rear mounted readers on some other phones. I can only register 3 fingers and the recognition rate is about 20%.\n\nThis phone has 4 camera lenses and I have no idea why. There are only 3 modes. Image quality is poor and I can't see any way to improve it. Do not buy this phone for taking photos.\n\nThe screen is nice and battery life is good but not outstanding. 128GB of storage should be enough for most people. The compass is extremely erratic",
            "I'd previously had a Samsung Galaxy A40 which was a brilliant phone. The A51 is a great phone too but with one major flaw. The fingerprint and face sign in is so unreliable it makes the phone so irritating to use. You jab jab jab tap place hold etc at the fingerprint  sensor on the phone and eventually the phone opens. Sometimes it works first time but rarely it does this.  You use your face and sometimes the phone opens and often it doesn't. Plus if it does open you then have to swipe to open the screen. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the A40 was a touch and the phone opened. This is progress? I've got this phone on a contract and I'm seriously considering returning it as this one aspect bothers me so much.  Everything else is standard Samsung which means excellent build and a great looking screen.",

For  an  older   model  phone  I   am  pleasantly  surprised  at  all  the  up to  date  functions  it  has,  and  the  camera  is  brilliant.  I  was  toying  with  the  idea  of  a  more  expensive  phone,  thinking  it  would  be   better  to  get  a  newer  model,  but  so  glad  I  didn't .  Couldn't  be  happier.",

            "looked online for a phone with a great camera and plenty of GPS. This hit the mark, cheaper here than other online stores, delivery day as requested. All good. I have a great simbinky contract, sk all in all saved money and Samsung is my choice for a mobile phone.",
            "this is a great phone, great screen, battery and cameras. It can be laggy at times which I don't understand why.  But happy with it none the less.",
            "I updated my phone, to have a better camera, which it is, and at under £300, I felt that was a fair price. And just found the 3x3 keyboard bonus.",

            "this phone is easy to use and the camera takes excellent photos. Would definitely recommend this phone. My niece has a top of the ranges s20 and we can't see any difference except the a51 is slightly and only slightly bigger.",
            "Bought this A51 as a replacement for my ageing Xperia X.  It was easy to set up straight out of the box, all the info from my old phone transferred across after installing Samsungs app on the old phone, just placed them next to each other and it copied over.  The battery life is so much better than the old Xperia. The cameras are excellent for a mid priced unit like this.  I've been using it for around 2 weeks so still early days but so far, so good.",
            "Bought this phone especially for the choice of camera lenses and quailty. Very pleased with the results. Fast processor and good battery life. It makes phone calls and texts too!",
            "I have had this phone for two weeks and I am well pleased with it so far.\nIt is smart in appearance in an understated way.\nThe display is clear and easy to follow. The colour photography is sharp and realistic.\nIt was easy to tailor sound, ringtone, back-light etc to my personal preferences.\nWeb browsing is quick and responsive. \nHaven't found any negative points yet.\nIn my view it represents good value when compared to its competitors.",
            "It could be better. The camera is really good but the battery life isn't the best. Features are standard for a Samsung really. Its weird that you have to hold down the Power button AND the volume down key to turn the device off. And it doesn't have a dedicated camera button. I'd say its worth the money as it is only quite cheap but I probably wouldn't recommend to a friend.",
            "I am haply with my purchase love the new phone .Very quick process for collection good customer service",
            "Great memory and looks great nice phone",

Very happy with the phone now i have worked out how to get rid of some of the notifications that would wake me at 3 in the morning.Its just a matter of playing with it to get your head around what it has and what you dont want.

            "Needed a new phone quickly as mine had died and I was using an old old one! Read the reviews, wasn't my first choice but I am more than happy. Downloaded an app that enabled me to transfer everything from the old phone to the new, took minutes.  Loads of storage, space for 2 sim cards plus additional memory card. Camera is great, it's easy to use. 10/10 from me.",
            "Replaced my old phone which was always running low on battery and running out of storage - the storage on this is 128mb expandable to 512 with a memory card so no problems there so far. The phone was charged overnight - I was up at 8.15 and have used it throughout the day for calls, messages and music - it is now 15.18 in the afternoon and the battery is at 89% - fabulous  it looks good performs well - thoroughly recommended !",

            "Really good i love it",
            "Think it's a little unfair the A51 has been slated a little recently.. For the price especially the fact its gone down in price its got a fantastic specification and the camera is adequate.. 128GB of storage does the job and can be expanded however I purchased the 6GB RAM version as Android 10 is a little resource intensive and whilst 4GB RAM will do the job once apps are added using Samsungs standard Launcher is does slow down a little but not much. By using Nova Launcher and changing a few of the Developer settings personally it runs just as good as my friends S10 !",
            "He's delighted with the phone",
            "Great Phone for what I need  So much better at everything than the Samsung S3 I replaced with it - Great display and fast enough for the limited demands I make of it",

            "Wanted to treat myself to something decent, but affoardable. Once set up to your preferences is really easy to navigate. Im learning more as having the manual accessable on the phone really helps. Only had basic phones before, but i love this. I purchased a wallet case from another site as may slip through my hands like a bar of soap. Love it. Battery charges really fast too.",
            "Really good quality and battery life",

The display and sound are good. It has got a pull out tray which holds 2 sim cards and a memory card. I did find it a bit fiddly trying to fit the sim card in but that was probably just me. I would recommend this phone to anyone thinking of buying a new phone.",

Everything including all my apps, photos, documents, contacts, notes & emails were quickly transferred from my old phone to this one. The battery life is phenomenal it goes over 2 days between charges. This phone has masses of storage space for pictures, videos and music. If I have one criticism, it would be the charging lead, it’s very short. I bought myself some longer ones.",

The phone looks nice and has nice functionality. \nHowever once charging the phone reaches extremely high temperatures and it makes me question if it will blow up in my hand like previous Samsung have done in the past. The headphones are abysmal and if you use more than two apps at the same time the phone slows down significantly and becomes problematic.

            "absolutely rubbish. constantly needs restarted, extreamly slow even though i have only had it for about 5 months. Bluetooth is absolutely HORRIBLE. constantly disconnects and stutters, and occasionally pauses music when it is playing, if these could be fixed then it would be a great phone, like i don't expect to much from a mid tier phone but it should at least be able to function correctly. then again it could just be my phone. would fully recommend the A5 2017 as it is not nearly as bad",
            "Clear and easy to use. Love the camera nice weight and size.",
            "Have had a galaxy 5neo for years. Upgraded to the galaxy aA51. There is really no comparison except Samsung have always been excellent. All features of this high end looking phone are so easy to navigate.",

AND \nYou can't change the ring tone on an individual contact to a specific ringtone. \nIe. Have one ringtone for your partner and one for your work. OR use something from your music library as your message notification.\nI have searched the WWW. And cannot find a solution  Maybe its android 10.   Well regardless of what or who is at fault its wrong.  \nNOKIA HERE I COME.",

            "Wasn't expecting it be amazing - but it exceeded my expectations. Very nice design, with a large 1080p screen. Great performance, even when multitasking. Don't let the 3 cameras fool you though, becuase they're average at best - but I expected that from a handset at this price.\n\nOverall I'd say this is slighty better than the Galaxy S9+ I had before (which this replaced). Very good value for money.",

            "I'm absolutely delighted with this phone - beautiful to look at and handle, truly superb screen - especially for reading books etc. - fast, stable processing. The One UI is a pleasure to use - a great improvement on TouchWiz. And the camera! This was one of the main reasons I chose this model, and I am blown away daily by the quality of the shots I'm getting, and by how easy and intuitive the camera apps controls and automation are. Truly, I can't recommend this phone highly enough - I definitely made the right choice.",
            "The screen is nice and big and really good quality. Can take amazing photos and there's cool features such as the wide photo and micro photos too.

            "This phone has been great.The battery life is probably the greatest thing about it. I can second the fingerprint feature doesn't work as often as I'd like. The cameras are very nice on it, and the edge to edge screen makes it feel super fancy. It is not water-resistent in any fashion and no cases that are are available for it either, as someone who is very careful to protect anything expensive that I own, this frustrated me to no end. Overall I would say it was worth it,",

            "I've had it for about a month now and it's an amazing phone got a few tweaks like the finger print scanner and the camera in low light but the full screen with the hole punch makes up for them super fast can play most games like call of duty fine just wish they brought out a 7 inch screen version",

Impressed with the custom menu lay-outs and numerous features (like Bixby routines or the Edge screen apps) to make the phone a handy companion.\nThe build quality is solid and feels quite slick when launching apps. The rear camera gives balanced composition even if the source is lit from the back-side. Recommended!!",

I went for another A range phone because I loved the A5. The A51 was all vodaphone offered me for what I could afford. I had great hopes because of the camera. A range phones take the best pictures of all phones I've tried..ever...(and I have a work iPhone!) .....however....this A51 does not take great pictures...or videos because the camera crashes every single time!!!! I really hope it's because I have a faulty phone and when covid is over maybe someone will be able to sort it for me because I am paying for it still! All I'm using it for is as a wifi hotspot to make my A5 work while I'm out! \nOn a different note, the screen is fabulous and other features great but I got this for its camera so im currently not at all happy. I hope to update my review after covid!",

            "Two weeks since I have the mobile phone its lovely in everything but small issue it have, there are some times it gets stuck and screen freezes",
            "The price I paid would have been reasonable, except for one issue, which keeps reoccurring.\n\nI am happy enough with the phone overall, sleek, looks great, fast and the battery is good. Happy with the camera, works great.\n\nHowever, one draw back, the bluetooth...it has the odd occasions when it just stops connecting, stutters and generally does not work as intended. Only one solution and it is clear the bluetooth cache.... and it can get frustrating.",

            "I bought this phone a few weeks ago and I was just amazed with the huge display but there was a few things I was a little confused about. Firstly, as my phone is android 10 it should come with screen recorder but I don't have it for some odd reason. Secondly, my phone does not come with the option to choose between the display of Amoled and other types.",
            "This is a great phone I really love it",
            "Bought because of the camera ,pity not 5g",
            "Really good quality phone",
            "The Samsung Galaxy A51 overall is a great phone. The main reason I wanted this phone was for the camera features. photography is an every day activity for myself. After a week of using the camera app, it kept closing me out of it. This was frustrating, but after it updated it was fine. The super amoled display is exquisite. Unfortunately in direct sunlight,  or when light is shining on the phone it is hard to see the screen even when the brightness is at its fullest.",

            "My first impressions of this phone were very good as it looked well made, had great features and smooth, quick performance. However what I am not happy about is that only two days after purchasing it it fell from a height of only two feet from my car seat onto the ground and the screen smashed. This should not happen to a phone with toughened glass and I am off the opinion that it is far to fragile.",
            "This phone is utter garbage. The camera keeps freezing and the app constantly close. Do not waste your money.",
            "Ye brill phone until I dropped it after only a week. Wished it had been a bit more robust.",

            "Really pleased with this A51 phone. Not had chance to try all the features yet but the day2day usage hasn't caused any issues.\nThe reviews regarding the known Samsung issue with bluetooth on the A51 were slightly off putting but figured some future update would correct this. However, fingers crossed, this hasn't been a problem on my phone.",
            "This is an absolutely amazing phone \nPurchased due to damages on my old device, an so, with the feel and quality I feel as if it holds it's own against the s9 easily.\nThe camera setup the phone features takes great high quality shots especially with the 40 plus megapixel options .\nSound quality is great and over all this phone has no complaints from me\n Would DEFINATLY recommend to anyone looking for a mid range smart phone",
            "Bought to replace an aging Moto g, decided to spend the extra money for a mid-range phone and to me it was worth it.\nThe screen is lovely and clear, the camera hole is nice & small, the in screen fingerprint reader works well and the battery life is good.\nIt has dual SIM plus an SD card slot instead of a hybrid tray, which is very useful.\nRecommended.",

            "I am very happy with features of my A51 like the camera, ease of use etc, but I have to say that I am thoroughly disappointed with the battery life. I have to charge it once a day. I am using it more as we at home, but I don't stream movies, listen to music or anything, but it still runs down. I also close all my apps down. \nDisappointed as it was one of the reasons I bought this phone.",
            "Is a good phone....and the price is was very cheaper...",
            "I purchased this A grade phone expecting it to be less advanced and efficient in comparison to the S models. This phone does no disappoint. Would highly recommend",

            "I've had this phone about a month now and it really is great, but the battery life is terrible, it needs charging twice a day, I'd say I'm a moderate phone user, so not even heavy, but even if you use it very little while sitting there doing nothing the battery drains quickly.",

            "Absolutely love this phone, I usually stick with the S range but read a lot of reviews and decided to get a this much cheaper mid range device. Although the backing is plastic, you would not be able to tell, the phone feels very premium quality and has pretty much the same features as an S10 device. It performs well and quickly and the display beautiful. The camera is superb and the battery life is incredible. Very happy with this purchase!",

            "I'm not worried about my phone having wireless charging or being waterproof. The A51 has lots of cool camera tricks and great quality pictures for anyone who isn't a photo expert. Excellent value for money instead of spending up to three times more to get the latest top of the range features",
            "Great product and very easy order and collection experience.",
            "Switched back to Samsung from another Android phone after a break of about 4 years. Opted for the A51 as it had all the features I wanted but it was the camera that really sold the phone.\n\nI've had the phone about 10 days and I'm really pleased with it especially the dual SIM and memory card slot.\n\nHad some fun with the camera and I'm pleased with the quality of the photos.\n\nOnly negative is some of the bloatware apps that cannot be uninstalled but can be disabled, certain apps like social networking or video apps. I much prefer to have control over what apps I have.\n\nAll in all a good phone for a reasonable price.",
            "Fantastic phone with a big display and a hole punch camera. Quad camera gives variety of options for pictures. Battery life is excellent for day to day usage.",
            "I got this 1 week ago on an upgrade, great phone, always had Samsung and will never change.",
            "Bought this Galaxy A51 sim free a week ago and very very pleased.\nAs a wrinkley   (74yrs of age) I wondered how I would fair using and transferring my data from my previous handset.\nNo problems, all sorted within a few hours and I am enjoying exploring the many features of this newly released handset.\nMy favourite is the super wide angle camera which gives a really natural image whether in a room or outdoors.\nThe screen is so sharp, with vibrant colours and REALLY deep blacks.\nSound reproduction is exceptional and at last I have a phone which I can use easily with my hearing aids. \nNo idea about gaming or social network, Whatsapp runs perfectly.\nOverall, bang up to date technology in a wrinkley friendly package. BRILLIANT.",
            "Needed the upgrade and really wanted the s9 after careful thought I went for the A51 and I am not disappointed the storage is brilliant get more than the S9 cameras are so much better plus I pay less each month and still have insurance that is also so much cheaper all round fantastic phone.",
            "Looks like a good phone but it is a gift so I'm not able to comment further.",
            "I bought this phone to replace a Lenovo P2A2 when that phone started freezing unpredictably.\nI am not  a heavy user of smartphones. I don't play games, stream videos or catchup TV. I don't listen to music or take many  phone photos (I'm an amateur photographer and use semi-pro dslr cameras). I use phones to text, use WhatsApp, check and send emails, check Facebook and make voice calls. \nSo for my limited use the A51 is brilliant and, if I don't  have my cameras with me, the A51 camera is a good alternative. The phone is well priced for what I use it for.",
            "I purchased this A51 with high hopes as I've used an A5 years ago, before purchasing a S7 Edge, which i was overly happy with.  Let's begin with the one mishap that makes me cringe, the lag on this phone.  I have the 4GB Ram A51, this thing lags tremendously no matter what I do. My S7 Edge had the same capacity of RAM and I've never experienced such slowness with it. The recognition on the fingerprint scanner is not that great either. I am very dissatisfied with the availability of free themes and the unavailability of paid themes for my country on this device. I like to personalize my phones and I do not have much choice with the A51.\n\nThe camera quality is quite OK, I wouldn't rave too much about it but its pretty decent for its price point.\n\nThe phone has a beautiful design and I believe Samsung neeeeeddddss to provide A51 users with updates to rectify this lag issue. It is very inconveniencing, especially when you're running a business from your phone.",
            "I've  only had the A51 for a couple of weeks so still getting to grips with all the features.\nThe cameras and picture  quality  are stunning, will have lots of fun with  the video settings. \nBrought  the A51 as a sim free option and got a good  deal on a 3 mobile sim.",
            "The phone has a few small problems the fingerprint is not very good often not finding a match also the Huawei GT watch does not work with the phone but other wise it a good phone",
            "Best phone I have ever had and best phone about to be honest",
            "Exactly what I have Best phone of the year 2020, display is amazing, long battery life"
