            "I'm really ashamed that there is no sd card slot because 128gb is not enough and no charger with phone but everything else is great",
            "No head phone port and nothing compares to normal headphones. USB headphones aren't good quality. Neither the headphones Jack's are worth buying. I hate jot being able to plug head phones in. Not much different to the s10. I'd say the s10 or s20 are better Purley because they offer everything the s21 had and have headphone ports. Battery life isn't as long. Regret buying this phone",
            "I've had Samsungs for years now and was so excited to get the S21, spent all day yesterday setting it up and so far I'm a bit disappointed, you've taken away the Snapchat & WhatsApp notification tones, which are synonymous with those apps, there is no longer a notifications & apps section in the settings and trying to set tones for everything is a nightmare, I've finally settled on new tones but now I can't seem to get them to go off when each particular app does, so I never know what I've just received unless I look at the phone, which isn't always an option,  it's using the main tone I've set for emails etc for everything and I can't find how to sort it in settings...maybe I'm looking in the wrong places.  Normally samsung interface is pretty much the same just updated, but there's quite a few changes on here that I'm struggling to figure out, and it's frustrating. Having the lock and volume buttons on the same side isn't good for screenshots.\nOn the positives I love the camera, and the way you can go from one app.to another just by using the back button, but so far that's the only good thing I like, hopefully it will grow on me but so far I'm not overly impressed. Please samsung sort your notification tones out.",
            "S21 5G.... absolutely superb. Best choice made to come back to Samsung. Now I'm have Buds live, S6 lite and and going to blow my bank account up and get your Galaxy Notebook. Its so beaut. Thanks Samsung. Smashed this one!",
            "I upgraded from a S9 and I'm so glad I did.\nThe increase in performance from absolutely everything the phone does, from calls to scrolling apps, screen, battery life absolutely chuffed to bits with the purchase and easily the best smartphone on the market at the moment, no question.",
            "Bought this phone for everyday use, i own a galaxy fold z 2,but it is not good for taking outdoors,as its not waterproof,and a bit heavy and bulky,but still a superb phone/tablet, i was worried the s21 would be a bit of a let down,but it is not,super little phone that does everything i need,and i would recommend it.",
            "I have always been a Samsung Mobile fan they have never let me down and this one hasn't either. Love the 2 speakers when I was watching a Film on it I had to mute it to find out what the noise was coming from the other side of my Room, took me a few weeks to get use to it. Camera is great too Samsung you never let me down so far.",

            "Just received my S21 5g after my old S9 started to show signs of battery issues. I knew there would be no wall charger included and as I have three, I didn't think it would be an issue. Lo and behold, when I unbox the new phone there's a USB C to USB C cable included, not compatible with the three mains chargers I already have. So, rather than reducing waste, in my case it has been increased, in the bin go the now redundant USB wall chargers and I will have to purchase a new charger. Eco friendly this is not!",
            "Really Really enjoying the s21+. Best phone I've had in years, my last phone, a one plus 5T, was also amazing for when I got it and lasted me a good few years before the battery fell through the floor.\nI'm loving the s21+, features galore, an amazing camera  (the wide angle is truly wide and beautiful), great quality  in pictures and films in 4k, great stuff.\nIt is FAST the intelligent refresh rate for the screen is mad smooth and you definitely notice the difference when you swith it off.\n\nI have one major gripe though. Signal. It's poor, very poor. Has nothing to do with my location as I am on the same service provider (o2) and in my one plus I had perfect signal always, no dropouts and almost always perfect calls. The s21+ not so much, I use my phone as a hotspot to play games and watch YouTube through my xbox and I get terrible  loading times, lag galore and it can take a while for the data to connect.\n\nI hope Samsung sorts out the signal issue as I've seen other people having the same problem and it's pretty dumb that a phone of this technological prowess and price, would have either a poor antenna, modem, or just optimization issues that prevent it from being fully realised. \n\nStill though, very happy with the device and will continue to enjoy it for another 5 years like my glorious one plus. It'll be a battle between the two manufacturers when it's time to upgrade for sure.",
            "Its not as fast as samsung products use to me when it comes to txting and lodeing certing stuff the camera aint brillian buts its okay just like any other phone its worst part of the phone is its not as loud irs quite quiet even on half volum",

            "Best phone I've ever used. Though I wish the active backgrounds were a little more available. I always think it would have been nice to be told there is a second ultrathin screen protector on by default, for the first few weeks I was terrified I'd scratched/greased it up already. The thinness of this protector means you can literally scratch the plastic with your nail to increase a scratch length. A shame cos I dint even know it was there so the desired aim had been hit when samaung developed this protector.",
            "I'm loving my new galaxy phone. It looks great and functions really well. I haven't got fully into the camera features yet but it's taken some good shots already.

I've always had iphones ,but decided to change phones as I'm charged for everything with apple.The camera on the Samsung is quality at its finest.its better than my daughters proffeaional camera set up and a lot less effort .Will actually never go back to an apple product again now I've had my first Samsung. And what a fine device it is..",

            "Phone itself is brilliant, upgraded from the s10 plus, seen a big performance increase however the fingerprint sensor should have stayed on the rear like the s9. Limitation of a screen protector makes the phone look cheaper with a low quality screen protector as the in screen sensor doesn't work properly",
            "the battery durability could be better..everything else it's great,  very nice phone.",
            "I needed an upgrade as my old S9 was starting to fail me. In really didn't think there would be much is terms of a quality gap. Big mistake! The camera is different level and that goes for the rest of the phone too. Screen quality and battery live are superb.",
            "Great phone great features.  Only downside is battery. Only last a day and not fast charge compatible",
            "I'm loving the new Samsung s21 5g although I still have some leaving to do on it. I especially love how much storage there is but I am disappointed that it is internal storage only and there is no SD slot availability for more storage. When I got the phone the cable that came with it was a USB to USB charging cable not the C  cable so I had to purchase a new one but other than that I do really love the phone and I will never change from Samsung no matter what.",
            "The samsung s21 ultra is a nice phone and all the features are great. However, taking the Micro sd slot away just like apple is a bad idea. Thuis feature was one of the features that made samsung stand out from apple. This needs to be brought back. I still love the phone and the camera is amazing, but samsung are heading down apple way and this will lose them customers to apple or other brands.",
            "I love this phone its so easy but I hate the overheating",
            "The camera is the main reason you would want this phone, every photo I've taken has came out amazing no matter the subject, the 10x periscope camera allows me focus close up on a subject and keep the quality, video is also the smoothest I've had in a phone. The massive battery in this phone often leaves me with around 45% at the end of the day even with heavy use. The screen is the most colourful and crisp display in any smartphone at the moment and HDR shows on netflix and YouTube look amazing, coming from an iPhone I instantly noticed how smooth and snappy using the phone was, this is partly due to the 120hz display which is huge in comparison to the 60hz display on the iPhone. You will definitely feel the difference.",
            "Alway been a fan of Samsung since I got the Note 2,  the s21 seems great so far, Camera is great",
            "The phone itself is fine. No problems. Just ridiculous, how much is charged for these devices and now ear phones/pods are included!",
            "As usual samsung has made a great phone, but am gutted at the removal of the headphone jack. Can't use it in my car now for music. Tried a adapter but doesn't work. Such a shame",
            "I moved from IPhone with a generous trade in offer from Apple. I have not looked back since. Gorgeous screen and great responsive 120 Hz screen makes it a delight to use.",
            "the phone had issue with receiving mobile calls. callers can not hear me. absolutely unsatisfied with this for phone for this amount",
            "I was contemplating the S21 plus Vs Ultra. I decided on the S21 plus....wow! This phone is a beast! I'm very quick when using my phone like very quick and the plus just.kept going with me, no stutters no freezing just smooth enjoyment. The cameras top notch, captures great pictures of my fur baby and the detail 100%. I absolutely love this phone! Thank you Samsung!",
            "Upgraded from S7 Edge to S21. Can say the experience with screen touch is very responsive as always. Liked the design, its simple and nice feel on the hand.\nFace recognition is very slow, have seen other brand mobiles, were its very responsive.\nThe camera focus is fine at the default 0.5, x1, x3 but shockingly very blury at x2 and beyond x3. Should have focused on delivering better camera performance especially with 3 rear lens in the first place itself. Anyways will wait for software improvements to fix the camera issues.\n\nBelieve most of the features are part of android, and Samsung customised it well.",
            "Love this phone.\nGreen screen installed which I good. \nBattery needs to last longer.",
            "I have had this phone about 3 weeks now and it's amazing - I can't find any faults. Camera is awesome and battery lasts forever. I would recommend it to anyone!",
            "Not happy with the Samsung s21 u don't get a plug u don't get headphones took me a while to figure out how to transfer apps from the s10 to the s21",
            "Sleek design, fast and responsive great photo's that are on par with my slr. Totally love this phone, best one I've had from Samsung to date.",
            "Great for movies \nTv shows music sounds incredible\nIs there even need of a portable speaker\nBut over heating with gaming and multiple apps and while downloading too \nOver then that smooth and i would recommended it for anyone who has a busy life or even running a business because you can organise well due to the new features",
            "As expected from the S range this a fantastic phone. Colours are so vivid. The flow is amazing. Camera is second to none. Absolutely love this phone.",
            "Wow, I don't know where to start with how great this phone is, picture and video quality is out of this world.  Speed, I've never seen in a phone before and games are amazing.  The things you can do on this phone are limitless.",
            "Samsung company makber is a good branda but too much diktatör\nI am totally Very upset\nGood luck",
            "I have Starkey living Edge A1 aids and use Starkey thrive app. The app will not work fully and when I receive or make a call with my aids on , after a few seconds the call is cut off.",
            "Stupid place to put sim draw right next to identical microphone hole easy to damage and make brand new phone unusable.",
            "Just love everything about this phone  at the moment.",
            "The camera is by far one of my favourite features about this phone. It takes amazing pictures. The battery life is amazing!! It runs so smoothly and has a great sound system",
            "Nothing but trouble with it keeps over heating battery lasts hour or so then overheats and dies worst Samsung I've had and I've had the Samsung since the d ones then had e then galaxies 3,4,5,6,7,8,10 20 now 21 I wish had never got it and because shops were closed had nightmare trying to send back I definitely not think I'd buy again unless I was unlucky to have received a dodgy one",
            "Screen and colours are fantastic also 5g is amazing had a 265mbs conection the other day.",
            "Such a great phone. I am so glad I upgraded as this is by far the best phone I have owned. The camera is amazing, the screen is crystal clear and everything is so slick.",
            "I love the new look of the s21, it has great features and performance, the camera is awesome.",
            "It's very good camera and other installed applications.\nVery useful.",
            "I'm loving the phone but there are few little things which I find really annoying and it can ruin the phone usage experience. \n1. The phone sometimes lag\n2. Multiple apps sometimes freezes \n3. In a sunny day the phone heats up and shows a message saying phone is too hot (although I live in the UK which sun is only a treat)\n4. The battery drains up too quick and I tried all the recommended steps of putting apps into sleep and such but the battery is still far worse than even my older phone Huawei p40 Pro.\n\nIf these issues haven't existed, this phone would have been a top notch",
            "Great phone just need a quick shortcut to be able to screen shot info better, other than that camera and screen size are great",
            "No ability to expand the memory takes 4 of the 5 stars it would’ve got",
            "Brilliant in every way except the auto-brightness isn't very responsive and the screen isn't bright enough outside in sunlight. Also a shame that Europe gets the Exynos chip for the same price as Snapdragon chip in the US. Camera is good, battery is good, 120 hertz screen is better than I expected!",
            "First, the flat display is what samsung needed phone is good battery is good even when 120hz is on but take it off and put power saving mode on and the battery life incredible. The only downside i have for this phone is the cameras at the back i think they could be better",
            "all perfect.imagine i amazing,speed is good..love s21 ultra 5g",
            "Bought on contract from sky after my other 7 year old handset kept crashing so decided to move from a certain other type of phone ;) takes a bit getting used too but no have sussed out thr quick screens and shortcuts etc bixby needs work though.",
            "The phone itself is awesome however one draw back is even with a fully charged battery, the actual battery life does not last very long at all",
            "If you want to buy mine let me know! I just bought mine today a useless phone no headphone jack and no SD storage. Which means no matter how amazing the Camera you can't store the videos ,music and photos on your phone. 128 GB is no where near enough now. Its my fault for buying it online if i had seen this in a shop i wouldn't of been to stupid as to buy it. If you want a new S21 unused but opened let me know.",
            "All round well polished phone love it. Never was a samsung fan but os much improved.",
            "Phone is easy to use the first thing you'll notice is the quality of the screen its nothing short of superb. The camera quality is great. My only issue is the keyboard doesn't go to the bottom of the screen, not sure if that's something I can edit within the settings though but all in all that's a very small issue. I moved from Huawei and was concerned about battery life, whilst I do get a little less screen time with my daily usage so far its not been a major concern and has lasted most days without needing a charge. It looks like samsung have won me back and when my contracts up again I'll be looking at their next device.",
            "Had a few Samsung phones over the years. Always love the quality over other brands I've had. S21+ has not disappointed. Liking One UI over touchwiz.",
            "Love my new handset and everything it does s21 5g  would defo recommend already have to a few friends",
            "I received my new s21 yesterday,after transferring all items from s10 to s21,setting it up to return the s10.i find no earphone jack on s21!!! What a disappointment,I'm back to using the s10,as I use earphones at night to help me sleep! Surely Samsung should have included Bluetooth earphones in with the s21? All in the box with the phone was a USB cable,no plug no earphones! What a let down,after years of buying Samsung phones,& being very pleased.just saying .Rosie",
            "Best phone I have ever had and I've had a lot. iPhones, Nokia etc. Head and shoulders, the S21 is the best",
            "Very disappointed with the camera, no macro , and look pixelated when zooming",
            "Good amount of internal space,  brilliant cameras, nice interface",
            "When I first ordered the Samsung galaxy s21, as u was having trouble with my old phone. Maybe I didn't read it properly but the phone is a lot smaller, you can't buy extra memory cards as there is no where to put it. One thing I didn't understand or did my provider didn't even tell me. If I'm honest I think it's disgusting I was told and I definitely don't understand why I would get a cable with it, with both ends being the same, or was we told that head will no longer come with phones either but even if they did again you never said we have go order these extra things or you can't do touch on here. So I'm very disappointed. I think you should really put down that we will need to buy certain adapters, plus and charger lead.",
            "Love it, its really  good,  great camera  got some really good features",
            "Love the S21 5g from its stunning colour choice down to all the features available on it. The camera is amazing, it's easy to navigate and it's light and not at all bulky! \nSo pleased I decided to upgrade to it!",
            "Love the phone buy the battery life never in life of having phones have I had to charge my phone more than once aday but I have to charge this up half way through the day. I'm not always on my phone either if I could go back when upgrading my phone I'd pick another option",
            "No expandable memory no head phone jack your doing what apple have been doing an gonna lose customers",
            "Great phone as always samsung never fail to deliver, however, as a previous s9+ owner I don't see too much improvement albeit the camera is excellent. Given the price tag and minus some of the Samsung health features such as heart rate detection featured on the s9 plus are now missing I'm not overly impressed it has to be said. Of course no charger....everybody who owns a Samsung phone has a charger...yes...but do they own the 45w fast charger....of course not....so everybody will go out and buy the 45w fast charger....not exactly having an impact on our environment and more about making money, Samsung please provide chargers, after 3 years of the previous phone (s9+) my USB c charger has fair wear and tear and requires replacement and that will apply to the vast majority of customers!!",
            "Worth getting the s21!!  Next in the series I'll consider getting the ultra version!",
            "I love taking pictures and videos and this phone makes it so easy and I can do more than one type of photo and videos.",
            "Absolutely love it. Belting phone. Very fast and brilliant camera",
            "The phone is alot easier to use, since upgrading from Xperia 10, however there are some features Xperia had. Camera is 100 times better. However I had to purchase a new charging wire for s21 and an adaptor for headphones as I can not afford wireless headphones. That's the downfall.",
            "I told already. I want handsfree as well with this phone.",
            "Love the feel of the phone I got lilac colour love it.... camera take a great phone .\nVery quick and fast charging.",
            "Cameras both front and back are excellent. Battery life is great and i will never have any other phone but Samsung",
            "Love this phone the camera is excellent the pictures are so clear,the battery life is great,the things you can do on it are so fun.",
            "This phone is a step down from the s10,has limited storage and no space for a card,has no adaptor socket to connect to the car,camera is no better than the s10 infact I would say its worse. Over all the hype is greater than this phone! First time I have not been impressed with Samsung.",
            "Great phone with nice performance, defenately not regretting switching from Apple. Only little issue with zoom, even with 3× lens, pictures don't look fantastic at all. Other than that it Is GREAT so far.",
            "I recently got my Samsung galaxy S21 a month ago and I was always against Samsung about how there software is. \n\nThat has completely changed. I totally believe Samsung listened to their customers and has addressed their previous issue with there software. One UI is not a heavy skin on Android now. It's actually really good!\n\nThe stand out feature I really enjoy is the tight integration with windows 10. Being able to use my apps on my computer to send quick messages and actually use my apps is brilliant.\n\nThere is still work that needs to be done in the link to windows like a tighter integration with Microsoft to do.\n\nOverall the phone is great. Battery life will get you through the day and more if you are a light user. Screen is bright and the high refresh rate is really good. \n\nIf you have a phone that's is 2 or 3 years old this phone is definitely a good upgrade.",
            "Finally upgraded from my old S8 (I had an S6 previously) to the S21 5G and could not be more happier. Everything runs more smoothly, battery lasts a full days use, and I love the camera",
            "I've just upgraded from the a70 to the s21+ and to be honest I don't notice many differences , speakers are a bit bigger and the earpiece doubles as a second speaker , screen looks just about the same and feels the same in my hand .\nIf it had the edge to edge display it would feel a lot more of a high end phone , half tempted to sent it back and get the a72 when it comes out",
            "I found out its waterproof with ip68 which is great up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. I also found out there is facial recognition which I haven't used yet but am waiting  for a haircut just incase XD I am giving the phone 4 stars because there's always room for improvement",
            "Happy with all performances. Good phone and happy I choose the Samsung s21",
            "I was so keen to get a new phone. I have been with Samsung for a long time now and for a while I had stopped getting the latest phones. I went from a Galaxy S9 to the Galaxy S21, a big jump I know. The phone is AWESOME! Number 1 happy customer",
            "I've been with Samsung a very long time now. I've moved up from the S9 to s21 5G and very happy with it so far.",
            "Each year they get better and better. I've had samungs for the past 10 years and love them",
            "It's gggggreat. Samsung have done it again\nLove it thanks",
            "I got an ooh I really like that colour when I showed my daughter the new S21.\nIt's got an amazing camera so sharp and clear. \nEasy to set up and navigate yourself through all the features.\nI gave a rating of 4 stars because of the face recognition.  I had an iPhone 11 before getting the S21, face recognition worked everytime and on apps too.\nThis is the only negative I have with S21.\nApart from that I give 5 stars.",
            "Not a good phone if I play on a game for about 10 minutes the phone gets red hot. Takes nearly 2 hours to charge and only last for a day. And comes with no charger or headphones",
            "Battery is an issue though, overheating and quick drainage",
            "Very good camera.  Very good software Very quick operation. \nEasier to use .",
            "Previously had an Android phone way back when, and regretted every minute, so went to apple. As things progressed and I had more and more apple phones I decided that they are all the same no matter how \"newer\" they get, which is okay I just fancied trying something new for a chang...so gave this a try and in loving every minute of it - cannot put it down. \nIt's stunning display, you can customise and personalise pretty much everything. The camera is just phenominal, the speed, battery life, I haven't got a single bad word to say yet other than the screen protectors. They are very flimsy and if you get a glass one the finger print recognition is reduced. So I have yet to find something I think will protect it without adding a lot of bulk to the phone. That being said I have one of the flimsy ones on at the minute and I'm being careful with it so I don't actually know if it will.protect the screen or not. Only time will tell.\nI thought I'd have to give it back and go back to apple but I have to say I'm sold on Android now, they have come on in leaps and bounds.",
            "I love the fact the edge screen is no more! I think a flat screen is far more functional! The camera is great and everything runs smoothly, especially scrolling with the 120hz screen refresh rate! Back on top form Samsung!",
            "With all the media interest being directed to the S21Ultra, the S21 5G has slipped under the radar. And yet, it has the same power under the hood, the same operating system, 120hrtz refresh rate, Gorilla Glass invectus on the main screen etc. Add to this a size that fits most hands and you have a winner!",
            "Smooth operation, brilliant display & sharp camera.",
            "Still after 2 months, I'm learning how to use the camera.",
            "Made the change from my S9, and can't believe how much better it is! Absolutely lightning quick via WiFi and 4g , no 5g as yet to call on :( but is superior in every way to the S9. Battery life is outstanding, lasting a full day of weekend surfing. Calls and standby last forever. Camera is simply awesome, instant pics of great quality whatever the conditions AAA+++ Small issue would be the black dot at the top of the screen but you get used to it,  after all it used to be a whole black line, and give a few mm more screen.",
            "Apart from all the great features on this phone, the one thing you have to be able to rely on is the battery not letting you down.  By the end of the day the battery usually shows over 60% charge remaining and even on heavy use days never goes below 40%.",
            "I absolutely love my s21 the camera is amazing. So many great features. Here's a photo I took the other day",
            "I didn't explore it enough yet, but it's take nive photos",
            "It's a great phone, easy to set up. Battery lasts a lot longer than my other phones (and I use my phone a lot!!!)",
            "Overall quality phone and really easy to use and set up",
            "I recently upgraded from galaxy s9 and what an upgrade it is vastly superior in every aspect better camera more responsive faster all round fingerprint sensor is amazing very fast unlocking already looking forward to the s23 which hasn't even been announced yet",
            "The redesign is a breath of fresh air! Build quality is exceptional as always with an S series. Screen is beautiful and performance from the Exynos chip is an improvement on the last generation.",
            "Smooth device does everything you need and more..apart from the c type jack. I use my phone while playing and talking with friends for hours (4+) so this makes ear buds pointless. I've tried 2 c type connections but voice quality hasn't improved. \n\nBRING BACK JACK!",
            "Everything is spot on apart from one omission which is the lack of space for external memory card",
            "This is my 1st Galaxy S21 Ultra ever and I absolutely love it. My wife has always had samsung phones and I must say the one thing on samsung phones the volume is loud which I love so much. I had a google pixel 3 before this one and all though the phone was good the volume was not all that and so its  Features. But on this galaxy s21 ultra the features are just amazing. I would recommend to anyone to get one of these it's just simply fantastic.",
            "Great phone but battery life is very disappointing",
            "In my eyes the best feature is the quality of the photos it takes. The battery life is superb. The phone itself looks beautiful and feels just right, the weight in your hand feels good, the finish of the casing feels good quality. I just love it ... oh and the screen is super responsive and fast.",
            "Excellent phone,  a positive update from the S20\nSlightly disappointed in that the phone comes with USB c to USB c cable but all my chargers are USB type A ( had to buy a charger)",
            "No option to add a SD card to expand storage.\nNo charger cable or plug, even after mocking apple for doing the same thing earlier.\nNo headphones included.\nThe plastic on the back looks much cheaper than the older models....\nAlso no finger scanner for heart rate and oxygen levels.\nPlease stop cutting corners and going for a cheaper phone, it's harder to win arguments against apple fan boys now...",
            "It has everything that I need and more. So easy and very useful for work and pleasure.",
            "I have always used Samsung and the s32 does not disappointed. The camera is fantastic can turn anyone into a photographer. The features are excellent so easy to use too",
            "Biggest mistake buying this phone. The battery is terrible and drains so fast even with every possible feature turned off. Returned first phone as thought the problem could be the handset but replacement just as bad. So disappointed as have never had a Samsung before and was expecting great things",
            "really happy with the phone and features but had to order a new charging brick in I was upgrading from s10 so needed a type c plug",
            "Great phone however alot of features have not been realised on the snapdragon model. I.e. chat feature between Samsung phones also unable to ever get a 5G signal.",
            "It's a great phone,but no charger plug,I came from I phone to Samsung so didn't have a USB c charger plug,and no earphones either,",
            "Absolutely amazing. I love the design. The camera is awesome. Fantastic phone",
            "So the Samsung galaxy s21 ultra 5g is a nice big phone. Photos are brilliant however night mode needs work. And it always disconnecting from WiFi.",
            "Still experimenting with mob,but so far love it. Working on pics too here is one from quite a dustance",
            "It's always a challenge getting a new phone but this is easy to use and everything makes sense! Samsung products are so much more intuitive",
            "Fantastic camera , still discovering new apps ..shame I missed out on free smart tag",
            "Lightning fast phone,great camera but average battery life which is disappointing, but I still love it!",
            "I love my S21 plus was very disappointed at purchase The store did not have a Samsung charger nor did it have a Samsung car charger That's very disappointing because sometime down the road I have to buy those 2 items",
            "Firstly 8 didn't want a larger phone than my S10+ but I wanted upgraded features so I tried the S21U. The screen wasn't much different to my S10+ but it was much faster and camera much improved. However the phone was huge and far too big to use effectively and carry in my pocket so it was returned and swapped for the S21. I've barely noticed the drop to Fhd and the camera is great but lacks the 10x zoom. I wish when buying a galaxy S product we could have all the top features across all the S phones, and not just the ultra model. If I wanted a reduced spec I'd have bought an A model phone. Not everyone wants a huge device. The S21U is well made and looks lovely but are the 120hz screen and camera really worth the price over the S21, not for me.",
            "My first thought when I open the box was the design I got the black version. Secondly I like the quality of the camera and it is a pretty fast phone.",
            "I really love my new Samsung s21 5g, all the photos and videos taken are do amazing",
            "Easy to navigate. Photographs are Ace\nConnection is really fadt",
            "Everything on this phone is amazing , faster Internet, amazing camera,  picture and video quality is amazing.  Best Samsung I've had so far. Had Samsung for the past 7 years, definitely recommend to anyone who's thinking of getting a new phone. So easy to use and loads of features you can play with. Love it .",
            "Disconnects from WiFi constantly and can't charge the phone and be on WhatsApp video call at the same time as the phone overheats \nDo not believe the hype",
            "I switched to Samsung from IPhone thinking its comfortable, but its seems very hustle. \nNo charger, no earbuds. Please also understand not all people are Android user so not all has a charger. So now you want to purchase again your adaptor. Too costly",
            "I think the samsung S21 5G is good at everything but it gets quite hot whilst gaming.",
            "I have been with iphone for the past 6 years and went for a change! Love my Samsung s21 however the only down fall is I can't charge my phone as its not a USB end you don't get an adapter or plug so after paying out loads for a phone you have to pay out for adapters and plugs and even new wires so you can charge on the go. No do you get headphones anymore so have to buy them too. I think if you are to pay so much for the phone you should at least be able to charge it and listen to music on the bus. Yh the new wire may be what you call an upgrade but to me it's a down grade as its useless really it doesn't plug in to the laptop car travel ports or even a plug. Would have been 5 stars if it didn't just cost me for new wire and plug",
            "Wow coming from a S8 it's a big upgrade smooth, fast. Not much for taking pictures but the cameras are really good. I'm not interested in having the latest tech but really glad I bought this and loving the red back panel",
            "Coming from old S8 this is a breeze. Shame about no SD card slot but I bought a 64 Gb pen drive which works well. Hope the USB-C slot can take a lot of wear!",
            "As with all samsung phone the biuld quality is great and the battery is very good and is quick to recharge",
            "Doesn't come with a charger plug, apparently to be more eco... Except you then have to spend more money to buy a new plug to even be able to use the phone.. Not even turned it on, not much point when it'd be dead before I got the plug through. Rather stupid. Sending the phone back, will stick with my huawei.",
            "I don't know why but I feel that my Samsung S10 was way better than this and I never complain about Samsung products something feels weird about s21 plus",
            "Alittle bit disappointed.  My 10+ feels a better phone and better quality.",
            "Really good phone I use it a lot with the xbox game pass and the battery life never let's me down I can play games all day without even having to charge the phone and it loads games up really fast top tier phone in my book",
            "Looks good and processor seems fast but on odd occasion screen freezes. \nI have the last 4 Samsung phones from S9 onwards. \nPersonally with the S21 I'm disappointed with the battery as it drains substantially faster than S20 despite having all optimum settings and checking device care for battery use.",
            "I switched from apple and got this phone it was a little difficult to stsrt with but what an amazing phone extremely happy now and glad I made the switch",
            "Love screen size makes doing surveys and puzzles so much easier.  Still exploring other features",
            "Really easy to use and fantastic design and the simplicity",
            "I must say I waited a little while before upgrading my S9 plus but it has led me to appreciate the great features and my love for taking photos has now become an obsession. Lol I'm well impressed, as always! I am adjusting to not having my curved edge, a bit annoying but not a deal breaker!",
            "Love the Ultra 21 - super fast processing of various tasks and dazzling display. Cameras are fantastic, such a huge range of possibilities regarding depth of field and zooming in . Best Samsung camera ever.",
            "Terrible memory and no expansion card means no music onboard, no space for video and anxiety regarding taking photos. If you own a S10 then the s21+5g will be a downgrade. Still stuck with bixby and a phone that fails to find portrait or landscape mode. No noticeable better performance than the s10. Leave this one and just buy something else.",
            "Just 1 issue for me is battery empties quickly but otherwise faultless.",
            "I love my Samsung galaxy s21 for the camera for the whole package actually I always take photos of my son and thw quality of them now is theough the roof",
            "I swapped my S10 to S21 Ultra and obviously there's a lot of improvements. Main reason I bought Ultra was because of cameras - I am thinking to get rid of my bulky DSLR. Also battery life - with playing games and my constant usage, after a full day I still got 30% left.",
            "I really like the phone the camera is fantastic and has some great features the only thing I'm finding so different from my last phone the S10 is the battery life. I'm having to charge it twice as much and I'm not using it any more than I always have done on my last phone . But other than that I like it",
            "Really good phone I love the S21 the features of the Camera and the phone is just amazing I am so happy that I upgraded",
            "Brilliant phone, only downfall is that you don't get a charger plug which is ridiculous...",
            "Switched from the S10 to S21+, did loads of research into the phone and decided that I wanted to go a bit bigger and am amazed! The features are fantastic and don't notice the size difference any more! Battery life is fantastic and love that you can take a picture from an picture! Sound is amazing, just overall love it!",
            "Very very impressed with the s21 ultra 5g. Great battery, very very fast. Camera outclasses every other phone on the market.",
            "Quality product. I just feel not having a charger come with it defeats a whole lotta purpose. How do you go from having 2chargers in the S10 packaging to none in S21?",
            "Although I have only recently got my Samsung S21+ so I'm still learning how to use all the new ways to do things all I can say is that I'm amazed at how much easier to use it is and the camera's aswell as the volume for when Im listening to my music is unreal truly happy I chose this product for my new phone.",
            "If I turn media sound on keep getting irritating notification music with no notifications???",
            "The S21+ is awesome \nIf like me you have lage hands most phone's will feel small but the S21+or the S21 ultra will feel right at home in your hand as the S21 +  does in mine .\nMake sure to get a screen protector thou as the screen is worth protecting \nOverall its a great phone easy to set up easy to use \nHas 4 cameras 3 on the back one front facing a torch that is really bright finger print scaner on the front great picture quality and high zoom \nThe S21+ is a all round excellent phone just be sure to get the best deal",
            "I have the S21 plus, I changed from the S9 plus. I don't like the one charge point and the fact it didn't come with a Samsung plug.",
            "Best phone I have ever had big upgrade from an s7 so smooth and easy to use brilliant features and the camera just wow",
            "Outstanding phone upgrades from s10+ and what a world of difference in every way. Well happy with this phone as they say its all at the touch of a button (screen).  Personally can't find any faults with the phone. Outstanding Samsung. The only thing I can find fault with is the prices of the accessories.",
            "This phone is absolutely brilliant easy to use and got a good camera",
            "Not as good as other Samsung releases but still a solid phone.   No 3.5mm earphone socket, no SD memory expansion.  Most annoying - smart switch needs updating so you can actually CLONE old phone and Install Clone on a New Phone.  Took 5 days to setup New Phone.   Very stressful.",
            "Love everything it's quick great for games battery life is awesome",
            "This S21+ is an upgrade from the S10+. It feels like a good upgrade. It's fast and I love the design. I'm happy to keep with the Galaxy world.",
            "I bought s21 5 g less than a week,\nGreat specs but battery drains very very fast",
            "Easy to use, great speeds, pictures awesome and better that iphone!",
            "The phone is great. Has great features like the camera, which I have taken some brilliant pictures with. Great built in storage, I went for 256gb version. Battery lasts, even when used for various things. Screen is great and videos look impressive. Only down side is the lack of a memory card slot",
            "The things I like is this\nThe keypad has got better\nThe battery is brilliant \nThe camera is WoW\nThe operation of the device is now polished and smooth\nThe sound has got better \nThe overall feel to the phone is better and it unlocks far better now\nThe operation of apps opening and switching is far far better.\nGood bye Iphone Hello S21",
            "Upgraded from S8+ to the S21+ and wow what a difference, have been super impressed with the ease of use so far, utterly astounded with the Camera, getting close up shots of the Moon I never thought possible without external magnification. Living in a rural area the use of WiFi calling is an inspired addition. Simple integration with my watch (Galaxy 3) and the earbuds live supplied with the phone make this phone an integral part of my life.\nThe stereo speakers are making streaming services great to watch as well!",
            "Love the new s21 thought I'd go for the smaller base model, which ticks all the boxes except battery life wish I'd gone for the plus model instead",
            "I can keep track of my life through my phone without needing anything else like a computer or a tablet. Love the camera able to take pictures of the wildlife near to work that we sit and watch on our lunch breaks. Light weight to carry all day and very responsive",
            "Upgraded from s9+. This phone is faster no doubt and the camera is better however rubbish on selfie mode in the dark. Not been able to take a decent photo without a lamppost to light up the background. For the money I wish I had just had my screen repaired on my s9+  as it was perfectly OK. \nThe materials used on the s21 are poor and my screen chipped on day 1 just from being in my pocket. Must have caught my keys.\nIf the next phone doesn't improve I may move away from Samsung.",
            "I really like the phone, it's fast, great pictures and does everything I need, but it has a poor battery life. \n\nI use my phone all day but tend to find I have to have a charger on standby most days, I had the A71 before and it lasted longer.\n\nI have tweaked some of the settings and it only improved a little.",
            "Had the S21 for about a month now and I have to say I am impressed. It's a bit different to what I am used to as I am usually and Apple user but this isn't a bad thing. Its relatively easy to navigate, has a useful Work profile so when I am not in the office I can choose to ignore work emails. Camera is incredible and the phone has some useful features.",
            "Where to start basically I love everything about my S21+ sleek, stylish and puts the Smart into smartphone, even has a built in Compass if your the adventurous type and the cameras are top notch to catch those shots whilst out on your travels. :-)",
            "So let's start with the bigining:\nThe biggest reason for my \"upgrade\" from S10+ to this s21+ 5g was the battery life. Guess what? No changes, maybe worse. If you get 7 hours on normal usage with some waze... maybe..\nYou can use more apps in the same time, it's ovearheat and shut everything. \nCamera??? It's one of the worst camera i ever seen. If you dare to think you're able to shut closer or macro pictures you will have the biggest disapoitment from a phone camera. \nUnfortunately i cant change it because i preorderred and i need a good phone with a good battery. If you need more examples do not hesitate to contact me.\nAnother big disappoiment, you'l need to buy a charger because doesn't come with one = more money for Samsung. \nNot recomend to spend you're money on this phone and i will write this review everiwere.",
            "It's been one month . I have got screen protector plus full 360 case front n back. And it felt jus once and my screen got a dot. Not happy with the screen. Its really weak. After all the protection. Dissapoinment",
            "I've upgraded from a Samsung S10 to the S21 and although it is noticeably smoother and faster thanks to its new processor and 120 hertz refresh rate it still doesn't feel like much of an upgrade. I would go as far as saying it's the smallest leap I've experienced with Samsung phones ever since I started with the S6. \nThe reason for this, in my opinion, is that it is bulkier and heavier than the S10, the battery durability is about the same even though it is larger and my biggest gripe about the S21 is that the signal strength is quite a bit worse than the S10 which is a major drawback and, quite honestly, a deal-breaker for many (see images attached comparing the 2 using same SIM card, the higher -db the poorer the signal strength).\nI've not managed to have a decent conversation on this new phone without it cutting out.\nIf I had known this beforehand I don't think I would be writing this review right now. \nAt best there could be a software update that could help but sadly I fear this is more of a hardware issue than a software issue.\nDon't get me wrong, there's plenty to like about this phone but do your research (please take a look on the Samsung Members page), this is a decision that could affect, quite possibly like me, your next 2 years!",
            "Top phone! Great camera and excellent performance!",
            "Camera is amazing , easy to use and a brilliant phone",
            "Absolutely love the s21. I have the lavender  and the rose gold pops out in colour. It runs superfast and so easily.",
            "The s21 is the best by far,elegant and fast. Thankyou SAMSUNG",
            "Great phone however no charger is included and given the price point I would expect the basics such as a plug to be included or at least some way to charge it",
            "I don't love it! its totally a downgrade from the S20 Plus and i regret getting it!",
            "Amazing phone. The camera is fab the battery life is brilliant \nNo complaints",
            "Very  disappointed has some good features but my 4 year old u11 has faster 4g and the battery is awful and still the galaxy buds have not arrived",
            "So far I'm loving the phone. Particularly the camera, the 0.5x lense is a god send for me. As someone who takes a lot of property advertisement photos, I can get much better photos with the camera. Everything else seems to be have been polished and updated from my s9. The only negative I can give is, I think the battery still doesn't last long enough. Other than that, loving the phone so far.",
            "For the price we're paying the least u could do is include a charger plug. \n\nOtherwise tho, great phone",
            "The s21 5g is nice and slim and lightweight  which I like. Easy to set up and personalise. Has Great features as well as being able to take tip quality pics.",
            "Really great..biometric a little clampsy but OK, 256gb is great!",
            "Quick and easy set up. Nice design. Quick delivery.",
            "Phone is good but its a good job my partner has the s20 otherwise I wouldn't be able to charge the thing. Maybe Samsung should take into consideration people upgrading from a 3 year old phone that has different charger and cable...",
            "Quick to set up loving the long life on the battery great camera",
            "I have come from the s10+ to the s21+ .I really can't see much of a difference. Still a great phone but",
            "Everything us very smooth camera is fantastic not found any problems with this device sound quality is very good to and very fast",
            "I really love the Galaxy S21, and in Phantom Violet no less. Phone is fast, really fast and at 120hz ots amazingly smooth. The reason for not giving this phone a full 5* is simple, no expandable memory slot which Samsung are known for. I can live without the headphone jack and not getting a charger adapter, but no expandable memory is a bit of a let down. However the phone is amazing, the ability to unlock with finger prints on the front is what I have missed, as well as a flat display is an added bonus(in my opinion). In the S22 iteration I, and I'm sure many loyal Samsung customers would love to have the expandable memory put back.",
            "1st new phone since S7 and I'm finding the new S21 fantastic. Enjoying the new features and the speed of accessing apps and Google. Quality made and so easy to use.",
            "Even writing this the phone is slowly cooking my fingers with how hot it gets. And it's not a faulty handset as the wife's is the same. \nYou can't multitask while on a facetime as the phone overheats and closes the facetime window\nI should have just switched to iPhone",
            "I had the S20+ before the S21+ and it's felt like a downgrade in every way. The s21 is much hevaier too and you really notice it. No SD card slot either... no reason why you shouldn't get the S20+.",
            "Sleek phone, lovely design and easy to use. Love it",
            "Fantastic phone, great features and very nice camera.",
            "Treated myself to the S21 but wish I didn't & kept my Huawei mate 20 pro. Firstly unlocking the S21 is a pain using face recognition it's hit & miss (more miss) and only slightly better using finger recognition. Considering the mate 20 is 3 years older it does a far better job at unlocking. I haven't noticed any great difference on pictures on camera but it's early days yet & haven't given it a good test yet. Battery life also seems to be shorter on the S21 compared to mate 20. All in all with daily use there's no great thoughts of wow this S21 is brilliant for the money spent.",
            "Great phone and features. Shame about the poor face recognition - I'm afraid it's nowhere near as reliable as the iPhone. C'mon and sort out please,",
            "AMAZING phone.   \nIssues:\n- I wish the battery life was better.\n- There was an integrated wallet s-pen case from Samsung.\n- 45w charger should be standard in a phone at this price. \n- No Headphones.",
            "The speed of the s21 ultra  is outstanding and the camera is superb the display is pin sharp stunning phone",
            "No filter needed! Impressed so far with my S21!!!!",
            "I was slightly concerned when my phone got fairly hot when performing basic tasks but after the first week that has completely disappeared, likely down to battery usage optimization. Cameras are great, display is crisp, smooth and vibrant and everything I'd expect from a Samsung flagship is there. Although the ultra recieved the most praise, you can't go wrong with the plus. Thanks Samsung",
            "Good, robust device so far that finally has a decent battery to get you through the day without \"range anxiety\".\nCamera very good, loads of features that I haven't even used yet! \nSpeakers are fine for watching films and music and screen is very clear and bright.\nPhone seems well made and robust so far although whether the dreaded Samsung wobbly charging socket which stops charging eventually develops remains to be seen.",
            "Pre-order the phone, get delivered but i was the unlucky person because battery could barely hold charge for 4h. WFH and being on the zoom calls for upto 5h a days due that battery was dying on me every 4h. Cut the story s21 5g got battery issue. Phone have to charge 3 x time to go through a day. Disappointed samsung should have read the current situation where people are more dependent on the phone to work from home. Make the phone with battery to last long. What is the point of focusing on the camera where some of us locked inside the house. S21 5G could have been a better device if it has a decent battery.",
            "I previously had the s10+ which I thought that samsung couldn't better but they have with s21+. Brilliant screen and camera, the battery lasts all day with it. Couldn't have asked for a better phone",
            "Samsung hasn't issued all the phone details to allow new contracts to be set up with 3\n\nWill be 2 weeks without a phone",
            "Got the mid range phone but wish I had gone fof the top model . I think that the S21+ has many great features and well worth the money",
            "I have always loved the galaxy range but this Samsung galaxy 21 plus is fantastic! The only down side is no memory card slot and no jack for normal headphones.",
            "I love Samsung phones but the S21+5g is amazing, the camera is fantastic and the pictures have such clarity compared to my last phone which was a well known make",
            "The Samsung S21 is a great phone! Great battery life! The HD video is amazing!!! One thing I would prefer is if it had a headphone jack so you can plug in wired headphones if you don't want to spend out on wireless earbuds",
            "Was a bit apprehensive swapping to samsung s21 as I've never owned a samsung but wow what a phone so glad I've made the switch.  Its really easy to use and understand and every day I've been using it there's new features that I keep finding to make using it even easier",
            "I recently had to move from my lovely S8+ with curves, slim and lovely feeling when holding it, to S21 and my first impressions was \"going back in time, this phone (S21) its same as my old S5!\".\nThe metallic frame brought me memories of the plastic one that S5 had and not wanting to go back into that look again. I think I'll pass this phone to my wife eventually and I'll see what another Samsung phone I can find for myself at the time.\n\nIn terms of quality, all good, as expected with top Samsung phones.",
            "How on the Earth can you not include a charger in such expensive phone?",
            "Absolutely dire battery life. Drains in a wink, despite following all advice. Even in airplane mode.",
            "No charger \nNo headphone jack\nNo memory card\nThe volume button on right hand side only 128mb memory not happy with SAMSUNG S21 disappointed",
            "Brilliant phone no issues so far just usual loads of updates including system but great start",
            "The S21 is excellent, a nice size, smooth operation and feels like a premium product, with all the apps and support I've grown to love about Samsung since the S3!\n\nBut, I do think leaving out the sd card support and lack of a headphone jack is a step backwards, and the USB C to USB C charging cable needed to come with a wall plug, not enough people have these plugs yet to leave it out.",
            "What can I say about this phone, It does everything I want it to do. I won't buy anything else",
            "I have been using an IPhone for 7 years and then decided to make the switch to Samsung with this beautiful looking phone which I am really glad I did, however even though the phone is beautiful and perfect in every way and I'm not regretting the switch at the battery is awful! I am on my third handset since the day of launch and the battery is just rubbish. IPhone always had amazing battery life one of the reasons I stayed with them but this battery is ridiculous so that is really one downside I am having to deal with right now.",
            "I'm still getting to know the s21 but its such an awesome phone. Its everything I ever needed, and then some. Live the Samsung switch so just few taps and all my stuff is on new device. Loving it",
            "1 less camera, lower resolution screen, less Ram, no expandable memory, thicker, heavier, cheaper feel and everything else is the same as the S20 plus, also you don't get a charger! dont \"upgrade\" to this",
            "I bought S21 5G and gus what\nbattery performance is same as my old Samsung S8 \nNice job Samsung!",
            "5G capability  needed now and S21+ 5G was the only choice for me nice big screen and soo smooth   as well.",
            "I have upgraded from s10 plus and I have to say I prefer my old phone. The s21 plus doesn't recognise my face and fingerprint takes forever to recognise. It just feels like its gone back rather than forward with the feel of the phone and its ease of using. I am really considering sending it back",
            "Disappointed with the new s 21 without accessories,  not sure why you are presuming that everyone has a charger which is compatible to your product,  if its really for the environment then at least give an option for consumers to buy either with or without accessories.  I think that this idea of yours is only suitable for those who are making more money form selling of accessories separately.  I find it hard to be excited about the new phone when its putting me out of pocket. This now is more of a nightmare rather than an experience. DISAPPOINTED. \n\nAll the e",
            "I've been a Samsung fan for the last five years. Previously owned the Galaxy S8+ and decided it was finally time for an update.\n\nI choose the Galaxy S21 as it was reasonably priced and had all the features I required. Never been one to go for the 'latest' phone but felt this one was definitely worth it.\n\nThe screen size is the same as my S8+, yet there is less phone; this is great as it fits in my pocket better and feels less cumbersome whilst using it.\nI love how the screen fills the entire phone also, no wasted space, as well as the front camera being placed within the screen.\n\nThe features are incredible and I'm still slowly getting through them all. Syncing your Google account to your Samsung account has never been easier; feels very efficient and cohesive.\n\nI've never been fussed on how good a camera is until using the Galaxy S21. I cannot believe how much fits in the new wider camera, feels like a true reflection on how you view the world from your own eyes.\n\nI also did the trade-in option, very good service; as well as the free gift promotion helping prompt my purchase. Would recommend this phone to anyone wanting a new or latest phone at an affordable price.",
            "Amazing phone very stylish quality of camera is incredible I own a dslr and this is not far off quality wise for a phone the sound is good has an amazing quality screen for videos and the performance of the phone is amazing the list could go on as always Samsung you've done it again",
            "Happy with my purchase would definitely recommend anyone looking to buy an android flagship phone. Just a little problem I am not fully satisfied with battery life.",
            "I buy this Samsung S21 when I get I surprised why stop giving charger and wire ear plugs. It's bad but overall quality is excellent",
            "Perfeito meu telemóvel goste assim simplesmente bom",
            "Vey happy overall. nice upgrade from an S7!\nOnly negative the fact that no charger was included..\nhighly recommend",
            "Loving my new s21 nice screen size and bat life...",
            "The battery lasts absolutely nothing.  It consumes between 40% and 45% of battery every night, without using it at all.  And I sleep between 5 and 6 hours every night.  So disappointed to have switched from Sony Xperia to this mobile phone !!!!",
            "Lightning fast, lightweight, fits perfectly in your hand and simple but stylish design. It's as perfect as can be and I'd recommend it to anyone.",
            "So far it's a great phone. I've upgraded from an S9+ so there are a few changes. Finger sensor is a bit hit an miss on this one, not sure if the sound when playing music through the speakers is as good. Performance wise it's good so far, battery life could be better but it's acceptable. \n\nThe phone hasn't blown me away but it's been good so far, glad I stayed with Samsung though.",
            "Thought it would be nice to upgrade from the S9+ edge to something new and swanky. Boy, was I wrong! First red flag,  no charger!!! Then, it took almost 3 hours to fast charge from 22% to 100%. When I took it out of the box, the feel of it is flimsy - plastic. Once I took it off charge, went to the shop (which is a 7 minute walk there and back), got back home and it was on 83%! I made no calls and just listened to one track!!!! I was furious. I've had the Samsung S4, S6+ and S9+ and always knew that the company have never gotten the battery life quite right and I could forgive them for that because the phones were awesome. This time, I can not forgive. It honestly feels like I'm being swindled. Isn't technology suppose to be getting better as time progresses???? Seriously thinking of returning. I have never returned a phone. If you like your phones small and slim and don't mind the crippling battery life, then I'd say 'go for it'. I would've gone for the S21+, but the price is too expensive. I think I'll stick with my S9+ until it dies a death.",
            "Pre ordered this phone in the violet and 256gb its perfect so far .",
            "Samsung you have knocked the ball out the park, again. I have always owned a Samsung and each phone that comes out gets better. This is a phone and more. Definitely would recommend. Absolutely nothing comes close to a Samsung.",
            "Gone back to Samsung from Huawei and I'm glad I did. Better spec great features and camera quality is excellent",
            "I am enjoying my new Samsung galaxy s21 plus phone still have much to learn",
            "This phone is definitely an upgrade from my old phone (S9). I found towards the beginning that the phone was overheating a lot but seems to have calmed down now. The camera quality is great. The battery life is much better. Would definitely recommend",
            "The s21 handset is simply superb in every way but one...the battery! I have relatively heavy use on apps but boy does is go threw power fast! This is whilst using dark mode, power saving and the lowest hz. If I had known before I would have waited longer to upgrade and gone for a model with a bigger battery, ie the ultra.",
            "An absolutely beautiful design and great colours available. The camera is epic, but still need to play around with it to find out everything it does. I have always been an android user (never liked apple!), but had only ever used Sony phones. Then about 6 years ago decided to upgrade my phone to an S7 edge, the absolute best decision and never regretted it. Samsung have out done themselves with this phone. I love it.",
            "I really love the new look very pretty and runs amazing",
            "Pretty .ugh similar to s10 except camera is better was expecting more but still a good phone",
            "Love my new phone. Great battery havent charged it in 2 days which is unheard of.  Would of given it 5 stars BUT the only thing that let it down was the fact it came with a c cable to c cable. \nUnless you have a c cable plug you can't charge it. \nMake sure you have a c cable to USB handy because it doesn't come with the phone. Wasn't very happy got a new phone but couldn't charge it so couldn't use it .",
            "I previously had the s9 plus and older models and this is a complete step up! I was considering going for an iphone but im so glad i didnt! The screen on the S21+ is gorgeous and the camera is amazing compared to the other models! Its fast, sleek and the battery is great! Love watching my shows on such a big screen. The phantom violet is such a beautiful colour and i know this phone qill last me for another 2-3 years! I never really used the extent of the features on my old samsungs but now ive set them all up and makes my phone so much more worth the value! Samsung have done a fantastic job.",
            "Love the Galaxy s21+ fantastic performance and battery life easily last over a day, great quality with a superb camera and features, so easy to use and set up",
            "It is amazing. I love my new phone. I'm glad I got the smallest one. Its still big but it fits on my pocket",
            "Great Camera and lots of features big uplift in quality from previous versions",
            "I love the new s21 and all the features. I moved from an s8plus to this, I love how good the cameras are as they are very clear. I am still getting use to using it at the moment. Such as how the volume button is on the opposite side from my old phone so I keep turning the volume up or down when trying to lock it.\n\nThe only thing I did not like was how I did not get a plug head with the phone as it is a different one from my old phone. What I mean is the charger for old phone at the end for plug is a USB connection and the new s21 end is like the end that goes into the phone so I had to but a plug head.",
            "This is a great phone and a lot to love about it, however, the one thing that samsung always fails on is battery life. I have come from a Pixel 5 and that had the same size battery but lasted far longer. Samsung get so much right but just can't seem to get this very important feature acceptable.\nThe good stuff... Screen is amazing, bright and slick with120hz.\nCamera is really good, I have taken some fantastic pics. \nMany people have complained about the plastic back but it really is a non issue as it feels great and will be more durable. \nLoss of sd card is also a non issue in these days of streaming and cloud storage, still plenty of storage with 128gb on the base model. \n\nAll in all a great phone but come on Sammy... Get the battery issues sorted!!",
            "Love my new phone, everything works nice and fast, great camera and it even comes with a screen protector on. So glad I decided to upgrade!",
            "I have average size hands.  I find this too heavy and big to use for prolonged periods.  Impossible to use with one hand without using one hand mode.  The camera however is superb.  The screen brightness also along with a few other features are top notch.  However samsung notes won't open. Facebook crashes for me frequently and my Bluetooth headset doesn't auto reconnect.  I'm debating a return but I really don't know what else to consider as the camera wins me over.",
            "I love and I mean love my S10e but thought  I'd upgrade whilst I have the money. I a seriously regretting it now. The battery is so bad. I'm barely using it, am power saving all over the place and the battery still discharges at an alarming rate. I could not go out for the whole day on one charge which defeats the object really. Cannot use the cable that came with it to charge. Hope my ear buds arrive else I'll have no headphones either. The plastic back is a real step backwards too.",
            "Samsung you smashed it out of the park on this one. Very smooth phone, great camera very happy",
            "The Samsung Galaxy S21 is such a great phone  The camera is amazing, the screen is vibrant and the phone is pretty fast compared to the previous models.",
            "The new operating system has some glitches. I'll wait for new updates. The bubbles system in particular is very annoying. Sensitivity of the \"back\" gesture also glitchy sometimes. But overall i'm satisfied with the product. Upgraded from S10+",
            "Been with samsung for years now and this is the best one iv had so slick and fast and easy to use",
            "I had the S8 for 3 years and I needed an upgrade, the S21 is such a great phone overall. The camera is amazing, the screen is vibrant and the phone is pretty fast compared to the previous models. Would highly recommend this phone.",
            "Easy to use . Really fast great battery life is great with great features 10/10. Well done samsung",
            "No plug have to mess about to get head phones maybe u making it to hard to buy Samsung now days. Would been 5 stars only for this",
            "Great phone. Moved from a cheaper phone and have noticed noticed difference in quality, speed and the Samsung apps are great too.",
            "I've had the S10 for two years and wasn't sure if I needed to upgrade. Having done so I now understand that the need for this new phone. So easy to use, and absolutely designed perfectly. If you have an S10, for example you definitely need to consider the S21",
            "Prior to this upgrade I was using the S9 and I without a doubt prefer that camera and picture quality. The only positive I can say about this camera is I like the zoom feature. It's also quicker than the S9, but overall not impressed with the phone at all. I also do not like the fact it comes without a plug.",
            "I've upgraded from a S7 Edge, so was expecting to be wowed with tech that was years better.\nDisplay, no where near as good and it is noticeable.\nCamera, quality lacking although director mode is fun.\nBattery doesn't last all day.\nStorage, not expandable.\nPerformance, its not a snapdragon and more reports coming in that the snapdragon is still much better.\nBixby, sigh!\nDex, bonus and really like.\nOverall, it's an okay phone but doesn't give me that wow feeling like I had with my S7",
            "No more just, there's nothing on the old phone I miss, s21+ is just better and its incredible,",
            "The Samsung s21 is a good phone and battery life seems to last as well ... the phone does not come with earphones as its has no earphones jack ... and the charger cable comes with USB C on both ends and no plug for a USB C so you'll need to have a different plug or cable ... the phone is great bit accessories are none",
            "The S21 is a great phone to use but the call volume isn't loud enough even when turned upto max",
            "I had an S9 and I move to S21. Great phone,  on every point, only thing is that I like to have more options to choose from. For example S21 only have 2 options to choose  on storage and that's it. The memory is only 8 GB, if I could , I would choose 10 or 12 GB, but I don't have that option. \nThat is the only ,bad  thing , I have to say about this phone.",
            "The phone is so fast, opening and closing apps as well as updating. I'm amazed by the camera. The battery lasts all day and I use it all day, music, social media videos etc. I upgraded from the S8 and its such a big difference. I realised there's more integrated features that I didn't need to download apps for such as the screen recorder giving you the option to record video only, video and sound or video sound and mic, which I think is wicked. \nThe only thing I weren't to pleased about is the phone doesn't come with a plug and I don't have the plug with a USB-C plug in, so that was a little disappointing. The transition from the S8 to S21+ using Smartwatch was easy and very quick.",
            "The new samsung s21 does not come with a plug and the charging cable is a double headed type c so cannot be used unless you have a persific wall plug. Also this phone has difficulty connecting to your samsung gear! Very disappointed expecially with the big price tag at the moment I phone 12 seems to be a lot better unfortunately!!",
            "I would say that this is a good phone without the excessive overheating and the battery drain. also when you try to zoom in, the image becomes very low quality even if you are zooming into 3x. the design is awesome and the price is great.",
            "Being someone who owned an S10 and hiq bad the battery was on that phone, this is greatly received upgrade. \nScreen 10/10\nCamera 10/10\nBattery 10/10",
            "Great performance and battery life is great\nExcellent camera capabilities and improved security. Screen is great and touchscreen responsive. Great buy",
            "Previously had the s10 just got the s21well impressed so far awesome camera and features great update on the s10",
            "Great Camera and good battery, all easy using from 5 o'clock morning till late evening",
            "samsung made a good job on the exynos finally now it's faster and no heat found yet and the battery good too but already been too many default app on the phone takes too many ram and lower the performance, i hope they these apps be optional for user not force found like this, thanks",
            "Everything is great except the camera the photo quality is terrible my Samsung s10 does better",
            "My calls keep dropping and it's driving me mad!\nI've had my network tech team take a look and the cell service is fine, proved by testing the SIM in another handset. I've used Samsung for 10+ years but I'm actually considering an iPhone at this stage :(",
            "Superb phone but the extra screen cover purchased at same time does not read print and had to remove so waste of 15 pounds",
            "Good upgrade from s9 agree that medical sensor on the s9 was good missing on this one samsung smart made it easy to transfer all data and phone number",
            "Decided to upgrade from my S10+ and glad I chose the S21+, really pleased with all the features and performance, I  chose the phantom black and looks very stylish, I can recommend an upgrade to anyone.",
            "Overall, excellent phone, truly an upgrade to my aging S9.\nThe only thing i can fault it on is the lack of sensor to read spO2 and heart rate.",
            "Fingerprint is awful,  doest work\n4months youtube offer doesn't work \nAnd free bud offer doesn't work either\nExpensive phone and just like the s8",
            "I upgraded to the S21+ last week and I'm so pleased I did.  It's heavier than my previous S10+ which I hadn't realised but it feels really solid in my hand. The flat screen means you see everything edge to edge. It super fast at start up, no twiddling your thumbs waiting for it to wake up. Connectivity is also fast, 5G is obviously working well in my home area. The lack of extra storage is the one area that made me dubious about this phone, obviously no issues at the moment  hopefully I'll have the same thoughts in 6 months time. Overall I'm really glad I upgraded, I'm happier with this phone than on my last few upgrades, well done Samsung.",
            "I have gone from the s20 plus to the s21 plus and whilst happy with the phone for the most part, I can't help but feel slightly let down with some aspects:\n1. No MicroSD - an advantage that Samsung had over Apple now gone.\n2. The plastic back of the phone - feels like a downgrade in quality from the s20 plus.\n3. Ever so slightly bigger in the hand due to the loss of the curved screen.\nHaving had the last 3 Samsung phones for the last 3 years, this I feel is the least improved upgrade.",
            "Loving using the new s21. Great size and feel. Looks awesome and has a superb spec. Totally reccomend.",
            "I think it's ridiculous that you pay all this money for a top of the range phone but yet it no longer comes with a charger! Which I find absolutely ridiculous you wouldn't buy a brand new car then have to buy the engine separately! I get the reduce accessories waste but you should be given the option to whether you need a charger with your phone especially if your changing brands of phone!",
            "This is for the S21 5G Exynos (UK) variant. I really want to like the S21, the extras software wise that Samsung have included are great\n The phone is great to hold, a perfect size I think. It's fast, the pictures are great and that screen, very nice.\n\nUnfortunately, the battery life seems to be terrible, after a number of charge cycles and it now being calibrated, it discharges at an alarming rate. It makes me want to leave it on charge all the time when aty desk which surely can't be good for the battery? I wouldn't be confident taking this out to an event (none of those happening fortunately) as I'd be sure it'd die before I got home.\n\nA real shame, crippling what is otherwise a fantastic phone.",
            "Decided upgrading to the S21 after it became obvious that my S10 battery charge upholding was shoddy, and had to plug it in quite often.\n48 hours since I un boxed  the S21  and I already charged it half a dozen of times simply because it goes from 100% to 15 % pretty quick, I must say.\n--------------LIKE A COTTON CANDY IN WATER-----------\nHonestly speaking I was expecting much much more....\nWhile I understand the\" Super fast charge \" feature, ( which it is only available if you buy a 25W adapter separately  ) I find the overall performance  disappointing.",
            "Feels way better than the S20,  and is way more efficient. It's only slightly bigger and is way better. Would highly recommend.",
            "I love everything about the phone but the battery on the S21 is not great at all. Good build quality, very smooth and responsive, great camera and so far so good... If I don't find a decent battery case soon I might be tempted to change. So far not even close to a day's battery life, not even close.",
            "I'm yet to discover more features. The build quality on the phone is pretty solid its great phone the only thing I miss is the charging plug and auxiliary input, I'm not sure how much difference there is between the s21 and 21 ultra so I'd love to try the 21ultra or the note 20ultra someday I've been a samsung customer for longer than I can remember lol",
            "This phone is amazing so quick at loading when browsing online, great speakers and display to!\nThe only issue I have is no charging plug in the box, for the price point not having a charger is unacceptable other then that great device.",
            "Hardware specs are great cannot fault, but the phone is a little awkward to operate being left handed.  Buttons are awkward to reach.",
            "A bit disappointed with the S21+ ! No separate connection for ear phones. No SD Card slot. A step backwards in my opinion.",
            "Love love love it amazing and beautiful neva thought ad be writing about a phone like this but it is just amazing",
            "I like the screen,  everything feels much smother and faster,  the camera is great.   The only thing I miss is there is no micro-SD card expansion.",
            "It's workings so smooth and look so perfect. I think , it's price worthy.",
            "Just made the transition from iPhone xs to the s21 and I now regret not changing sooner. The phones lighter, brighter and a lot more powerful. I highly doubt I'll ever go back to an iPhone now.",
            "Loving the colour I bought the violet one and its so nice all. Its easy to use not to bulky and the features and the performance are amazing",
            "Great phone, the screen is incredible and the 12hz refresh rate makes and incredible difference. (It now hurts to use my work phone). The design is beautiful and feels great in the hand but unfortunately I will not get to appreciate it much as it went straight in to a case. \nMy only issue is with the camera (again) \nThe over smoothing of photos means that as soon as you zoom in on a photo you've taken it looses all detail and looks like a painting.  \nThe focusing is much better and the single take feature is more useful than I thought it would be. \nI'm looking forward to receiving my S Pen and trying out the enhanced functionality that brings. \nOverall a nice update to the S20",
            "Just upgraded to the S21+ from S10 and I'm so delighted. Can genuinely see a huge difference between the two and how far Samsung have improved their product. I'm a huge camera fan and the quality is amazing what's more - the battery lasts just how it says it would! Very happy!",
            "It doesn't come with a charger just a double ended cable which is useless! Do not buy this phone.",
            "I've just upgraded from the S20 ultra to the S21 ultra and there is a big difference the way the camera block has been intricated with the cover instead of looking like an add on. The feel of the phone feels unreal and the operation is just classy. Picture quality is brilliant with lots of features which can be used to enhance any photos taken. Screen quality has gone up levels from the s20 ultra.\nThe S21 ultra is just a phone in a class of its own\nWould I recommend this phone definitely",
            "Everything has been refined , as someone who has been using s20 ultra and also uses iPhone max pro 12 it makes me appreciate the finer small details that has been added to galaxy s21 ultra from design , camera to display . It’s not a cheap gadget but it justifies the tag , a free set of buds pro and smartTag plus pre-release date dispatch added to an awesome experience. S21 ultra ticks  most boxes .",
            "just upgraded from the S20 ultra to the S21 ultra and there is a big difference the way the camera block has been intricated with the cover instead of looking like an add on. The feel of the phone feels premier and the operation is just classy. Picture quality is brilliant with lots of features which can be used to enhance any photos taken.\nI liked the S20 ultra just love the S21 ultra its a phone in a class of its own\nWould I recommend this phone defiantly its a top range product",
            "So after having the s20 5g for just over a year \nThe s21 caught my eye and I had to go for it \nThe 8gb of ram was very appealing to me and the slightly larger screen to \nNow been using it and there are only 2 things I'd say that I don't agree with \nFirst one being the lack of memory card slot,instead given an extra sim slot to have 2 sims in at once,not sure ibknow anyone that would use this as most people I know who have a personal and work phone leave their works off in the evenings or put it away \nSecond thing I'd say and I'm sure this goes across the board now and I'm lucky to of found this out now as my wife's new s21 turns up next week,is no plug is included and only comes with a double ended Samsung lead,when most house plug sockets now come with USB in them as we have think Samsung needs to go back to USB,which has come with my new ear buds live strange  I absolutely love the phone and just comparing it to my s20",
            "Great phone slim slick and very good camera nice, nice colours \nIt would be very nice if Samsung would supply a charger \nVery happy with it",
            "Straight out of the box this phone strikes you with it's awesome design. The camera bump merges into the body of the phone which for me gives it that luxury flagship phone feeling. Talking about cameras it does live up to the hype. Thing that impressed me the most was how good the night mode is! It can see things that even my eyes can't. Coming from the Galaxy Note 10+, the first thing you notice is the display, the 120hz is truly amazing it gives it that next generation feeling. \nBut as anything in the world, the S21 Ultra does come with its flaws. Although having a very nice design, coming from the Note, I instantly noticed how thicker and heavier the S21 Ultra is. It's still comfortable to use but it's something you need to get used to. Another thing that bothered me a little is the fact that the phone can get a little hot by doing simple tasks as watching a 1080p YouTube video or playing games. Talking about games, noticed that when playing Wild Rift if you accidently pull the notification bar down, when you send it back up the bar will stay there, covering essential parts of the game. But this is something that can eventually be fixed with a software update. \n\nOverall this is a great phone, with amazing features and good performance. It's not perfect but one of the best phones you could by right now.",
            "S21 phantom violet is a stunning colour with great design, easy to hold and use. Significant improvements in screen quality. \nShould be given 5 star- but plastic back cover takes away the premium look.",
            "I was a bit reticent at first weather to take the plunge and update my phone from the S20+. I shouldn't have worried...I really like the phone and am glad I took the plunge.The screen is super sharp and the phone is generally very quick between the screens.i really like the matt finish on the back as well.",
            "Upgraded from an S10+. Super easy to use, great overall handset. Cameras are fantastic. Plus the added freebies are a huge bonus",
            "The s21 Ultra feels beautiful to hold. The screen really pops colours and is a big improvement on the s20 Ultra. Improvements across the board on the camera, capturing pictures that make me feel like a photographer.  This is a phone to covert. Thrilled with my purchase!",
            "What can i say about this amazing phone.\nIt feels great in your hand. Very smooth and slick.\nThe camera which i was really looking forward to is so amazing. Unbelievably good.\nVery easy to navigate around.\nHavnt taken many photos outside. So really looking forward to that and how the colors will be seen on the phone.\nReally happy with product.\nWill be better n better as i use it more and use the features more",
            "I moved from an s9+ to this. The camera is marginally better and having a wide lens is helpful, the speed opening apps a bit faster, the in screen fingerprint scanner is much better than one mounted on the back. But I was surprised how similar the phones were considering they're 3 generations apart. This is a good workhorse phone, worth the price, but nothing has wow'd me like it did when I went from s7 to s9+.",
            "A smaller form factor and more hand friendly that my previous S10+ which was always a worry when going out cycling as worried it might just jump out of my jersey pocket. Nice and sharp amd really love the 120hz refresh rate. Only 1 thing that could be better is the back panel fitting. I feel the gap when i hold it and it's a bit visible but nothing that a back cover won't help with. A great phone..love it..and good price especially with the trade in",
            "Where to begin, my first Samsung Galaxy was last years S20 Ultra however this years S21 Ultra is a great leap forward. Last time there seemed to be some compromise with certain features the biggest was the option of a fixed 120hz refresh or you could max out the resolution, but not both. I went with the 120hz. This time we've got nothing to fight over, you want both fine have both. Not only that but the screen now offers variable refresh rates,furthering your battery life which is again better than last time. \nThe camera is another giant improvement over last years sketchy performance. Brilliant images and up to 8k video with some amazing options. \nDesign is beautiful I went for the Silver and so glad I did, it screams \"Ultra\" \nI've only got slight issue, the option of expanded storage is gone but in fairness with unlimited data, huge cloud storage and music apps like Spotify do you really need it. \nThis is the definition of flagship and the definition of Ultra.",
            "Absolutely great phone, camera is brilliant, much better than my old s10+. It's very quick, smooth and handles everything very easily. So glad I bought it."
