            "Got this flip phone for my friend. She's got a nokia smart phone but carries this alba for simplicity. It's less hassle than a smart phone and works well (but it's not perfect) although it's better than I expected. Can be set to end call, and/or answer a incoming call by flipping the cover open or closed. Only two built-in ringtones but I believe others can be downloaded. Not bad for a PONY!",
            "I chose and bought this phone for an elderly partially sighted friend. He cannot use touch screen phones so this fits the bill perfectly. He would give 5* if the text was larger. He only uses it for calls so is happy with the purchase as it comes with a 2 year warranty.",
            "This phone was recommended to me by the staff at my husband's care home as being a good basic phone which would be simple for him to use to take my incoming calls.

Broke screens on 2 of them before i realised that any loose coins in your pocket work their way in between the keypad and the screen while the phone is closed. also had to return one because it kept switching itself off. A lot easier to carry around than a smart phone. Build quality is not great but they are cheap to replace. Would have another one.",

So much for a warranty! I replaced it with the same model simply because I am used to it and it works fine when not broken.",

Tried multiple times to no avail so decided to take it back to my local Argos (lanark) who tell me they can’t take back returns because of COVID regulations but if I wish to travel to Sainsbury’s in Strathaven or Hamilton they can do that for me I guess I’ll just need to wait till restrictions are lifted as I am unable to travel out with my local area",

            "At first I thought this little clam shell ‘phone had come from a Christmas cracker, however once the SIM card was installled, a 2 gigabyte memory card inserted and a few names put into the memory card we were off to the races. Takes up no room at all in your pocket or bag......I see no reason why this compact should not become a very useful ‘phone........a further 5 stars for providing a docking station so you are spared the fiddling process of finding the charging wire and attaching it.",

Ideal if your looking for a 2G, calls and texts, monthly pay as you go which keeps you in touch if your up a ladder, deep in the garden or just busy, no need to worry about a phone costing hundreds falling out your pocket. Eyesight is not so great so I use a desktop for online use, this phone keeps me contactable",

            "Had to buy a phone for my 95 year Great Gran as her old phone failed.\n\nThis was very easy for her to use and had the bigger buttons, within days off having the phone she had a fall and still managed to use the phone due to the ease.",

            "Bought for an elderly friend who just wants a phone to make & receive calls. The docking station is the only part we didn't like, so just plug the charge in direct to the phone. Apart from that, its very straightforward to use. I'm quite jealous, I think perhaps I will get one of these when I next need a phone. The flip cover means it cant make calls accidentally in a pocket or handbag. For the money its ideal!",
            "This didn’t hold a battery charge and switched off after a full charge but Argos were great and gave a refund after returning.",
            "Excellent compact design with no risk of pocket dialling. The camera is very low quality, and the predictive text has no facility to 'learn' new words; since I mainly text in Welsh this means that I have no option but to type out words letter by letter. The torch is very handy, and the small size is perfect.\nOverall excellent value for money.",
            "Ease of use, Long battery life, looks good, and the charge port thou tight fitting, which means a hard push in to connect, it is good idea for the older person, and the features they look for.",

            "Bought for my mum, there's no way she would have been able to set it up herself, even inserting the sim is a faff! \n\nIt's OK, but you definitely get what you pay for!",
            "Just right for someone who only uses a phone occasionally. Although it does quite a lot for the money for other users.",
            "I had to get a refund, which was very speedy from argos. But I could not charge the phone, as the place where the charger connecter should have gone into on the mobile was faulty and would not charge! Very cheap and flimsy as well! Would not buy again!",
            "Have bought from Argos over 20 years this is the first item that was a sheer waste of money after opening the phone 6 times the fitment broke \nIf I had not thrown the box etc away I would have returned it",
            "It fulfilled my requirements and then some more...easy to use for big fingers on an OAPs hand",

            "The little Alba phone was up and running in 15 minutes, lovely bright screen with vivid colours and then to my surprise a message popped up on the screen and thanked me for purchasing a game for £3 and sure enough this little Alba had helped itself to £3 from my PAYG account and I hadn't even made a single phone call, be warned this little fellow has numerous colourful menus and makes it very easy to spend money. ",
            "Done everything we needed for my elderly gran. Wasn’t the perfect fit though so had to be returned.",
            "Bought these for elderly relatives who can’t do touch...... right away had to buy memory cards..... then didn’t like one of the SIM cards ..... just lets say the set up was not easy and the older people in my life would NOT have managed it ..... however got there in the end",

            "i bought this phone for my 86 year old father in law who is still likes his independence. The main selling point for me was the emergency button that once pressed calls 3 numbers until someone picks up. it is a flip phone so no pocket dialing but the numbers are large for the visually impaired with flip to answer and button to end calls. easily setup and very good battery make this a brilliant phone for my intended user. Only one downside would be volume level could be louder but A+ rating",
            "Easy to use, has handy sos button, fits in his pocket and has a cool charger.   Great phone, can use any network.  Good value for money.",
            "Large buttons, good volume and back light. \nBought for my mum who had broke her mobile and wanted something better than the phone the company offered at the same price.",
            "BOUGHT FOR MY WIFE ,SHE SOON GOT USED TO USEING IT ,THERE VERY SHORT ON RING TONES ,BUT ITS DOING FINE FOR HER",
            "Bought for an elderly relative with failing eyesight and arthritic hands to use as a basic phone for the odd text and the occasional phone call, this handset fails the simplicity tests.\n\nRight out of the box inserting a sim is ridiculously complicated. It’s dual sim so getting one sim in should be easy enough - right?\n\nUh - nope. Fitting the sim is a Herculean task that requires all logical approaches to be abandoned and the instructions are useless.",
            "Great phone well worth the money and very loud and big buttons so the numbers can easily be seen",
            "Excellent value for money, easy to use and understand. Didn't want a smart phone, didn't get one. Can send texts and contact people thats all I wanted and got.",
            "The phone is small and not heavy like some phones are these days \nMy mum just wanted a plain and simple phone without the games,video's etc etc and thus phine is easy to use and it a neat little phone for my mum.\nSuperb",
            "for the product found it well designed compact small phone that did the job",
            "Brilliant reliable backup phone. Even found it has a music player on it and an FM radio - great features. It has a Internet browser but it's unusable as it runs a 2G connection and struggles to load anything. Great battery life - left off the charger for 3 days and even then it had plenty of battery life left. You could get a solid week out of it depending on your usage. Definitely a strong contender for basic phone needs. Also fits snug in a pocket too.",
            "I bought this flip up phone for my mother, its so easy for her to use . Nice and simple with a nice design",
            "Phone is basic but so easy to use for the elderly and does the perfect job",
            "The phone is basic but it does feature predictive texting which is a bonus. Yes it’s not the best camera but it is good for on the go photos. The emergency call feature is a bonus though I hope won’t ever be needed. This phone was for my Mother who can work it well.",
            "I would not recommend this for a friend... \nI got this for my Nan so she can call me whenever she needs me, especially with this pandemic... I can’t even call her!! \nAnd she can’t call me!! This phone is useless.... I don’t know if we just got a bad one or all of them are like this but please if you want a working phone don’t get this one!!!",
            "After only 15 mins on charge, the docking station got so hot it melted the socket causing the flip top to melt to the body of the phone so it could not be opened. Returned for a full refund.",
            "Bought this for my elderly mum. Light weight and easy to use with large numbers which are very easy to see.",
            "Ideal for what was needed - simplest phone, clam shell to protect screen, small enough for a trouser pocket.",
            "I've had the slab tablet/phones, and the screen cracks as it's in a pocket or it's dropped. I've never had this problem with a flip top phone. It's small, compact but the buttons are big for someone with fat fingers like me!\nIt's cost reflects what you don't have in a bigger phone - word prediction, memory, Facebook etc.... But it does have a camera and music player so has a slot for a memory card, so you can take pics or have your own music.I\nSimple but effective mobile phone",

            "I bought this phone for my dad and he is very pleased with it.",
            "I purchased this for my elderly mother as I needed something basic for her and this fits the bill perfectly. Its easy to use light and pretty sturdy. It has dual sim card ability, camera an easy access torch button FM radio, games etc. It can connect to the internet but lacks the ability to perform like a smart phone which is a plus if you are buying your child a first phone. Its cheap considering its a mobile phone with so many features.",
            "as mentioned very basic which is what I wanted but would not store numbers so good for use of emergency only calls. The battery life was excellent but I'm afraid that is all I can say for it. A waste of money thank goodness it was cheap.",
            "We wanted a basic mobile to use with a contract sim.  We saw this one on line and decided it filled all our requirements.  Pleasantly surprised with how long the battery charge lasts.  Very easy to set up  and  use.  Good value for the money.",

            "Bought this for my mother. A simple to use phone without too many apps. Its a nice looking phone but you get what you pay for all the structure of it looks as if it is made out of the very cheapest metal and plastic. Charged it up and was navigating how to use it when it started to overheat! It was becoming uncomfortable to hold. My natural instinct was telling me that there was something wrong with this phone so i took it back to the shop i bought it from and got  my money back.",

Straightforward set up. I transferred the sim card from my old mobile with no hassle.\nThe first 'phone I purchased developed a fault in the internal display within a week but I was given a relacement straightaway..\n\nHappy with purchase.",
            "The worst thing about it is the small icon signs on the screen, very hard to see. The best is the flip action to answer calls and end calls. Good value for money if you are not wanting a smart phone.",
            "Bought this for my Dad who’s 80. Supposed to be great folder people \nMy dad loves a flip phone but this one has very limited things to adjust. You have to open the phone and press dial button to answer this is not very good . Also you cannot alter the text size either. Very cheap and nasty phone",

The buttons are bigger than average so easy for him to press, very basic and easy to use layout. \nFeatures a torch which comes in handy when he drops his keys early in the morning on his way to work. There’s also an fm radio which he loved using while he was in hospital.",

            "It didn’t work for long only two days so got a different one",
            "The phone works OK but the instruction booklet is tiny and not very informative. It consequently took ages to find out exactly how to load the SIM card. Also only 2 ring tones very limiting and could be louder, as could the talk volume. I also did not realize that the camera (admittedly of limited quality, reflected in the price) will not work without the addition of an additional card (not mentioned in the advert). But, hey, it makes phone calls which is what I mainly want.",

So anyone on my list knew it was me & I needed help) , the other phone had my long standing number, I was fed up carrying two phones & love flip phones. It is excellent value for money, very easy to set up. I had an email from Argos tech support saying if I had any trouble setting it up to give them a shout. I didn't need them. ❤️ It.",
            "Ideal for mum, she had phone before with sos button on back which was easy to catch by accident which meant she avoided using phone, she loves this as when it's closed no worries about catching sos button as its on keypad.",
            "This phone is ideal for someone who just wants to call or text. For the price you’re getting just that. It really suits the older person who wouldn’t be able to work a smart phone.

            "My new alba phone is amazing I bought it for my Nan and she absolutely loves it thank you",

Unfortunatle the interface / software on the phone is not intuitive or customisable as the doro. So is easy for someone to get confused with the menus just looking up a number. So if you really need cheap this phone is for you. If you want ease of use go for the extra money on a doro.",

The camera flash is a manual one that you turn on and the light stays on till you turn it off. The phone takes a bit of effort to be pushed into its dock. Then the charge light flickers so you don't know if it is charging. When I came to make a call, the person at the other end said my voice sounded very high and funny as if I had inhaled helium.

            "GVFM overall.  A no frills 'phone was what I needed so this was the right product.  One little gripe is that the list of missed calls is not that easy to find, but will probably learn to find it quickly with more practice.  Battery life seems a bit short but that will probably improve with successive chargings. Thumbsdown for the selection of ringtones - I chose the least ghastly!",
            "I bought this phone for my mother in law and she loves it. The screen is bright, the buttons are large and it can take send and receive pictures. She was very happy.",
            "My husband wanted an old-style flip phone as he only uses it for dialling out and receiving calls.  Unfortunately he put his old phone in the washing machine when doing the laundry! He was delighted that the new phone had a light and that he could get radio on it!",
            "I find this phone easy to use I would recommend this phone for aged &younger",
            "Easy to use and very handy.",
            "Having washed & tumble dried my previous phone I needed a cheap replacement. My old Sim card was unimpaired from the laundry process. So, all I needed was a Sim free model. It works well all my Nos. and pictures remained on the sim card.well pleased.",
            "My phone is used very rarely and my old one was a pain, it kept switching on the torch and if one did not touch a key for a few moments the keypad locked.\nTHis one is great, the clamshell keeps the keys safe from unwanted pressing. The buttons are large and easy to use and generally speaking it is just what I want.\nI was not impressed with the camera and have not worked out how to download to a computer. However as I always carry a decent camera this is nt a problem",
            "Service good but product not",
            "Bought this mainly for the bluetooth capability to link to my car. Apparently having got it home and tried it did not work. Researched it and it does not have that type of bluetooth. Also features on the phone are not as good as the one I replaced with it (now broken) and it was even cheaper. Really disappointed.",
            "very pleased with it and a two year warranty with it",
            "I did not realise that it came with two slots for sim-cards. I have got one of the sim-cards (Vodafone), but have no idea where to get another one, supposedly 'phone' sim card,",
            "Does not tell you who texts are coming from. You just get the text & have to guess who it is from by reading it. I had a girl fall out with me when I guesses wrong. A ridiculous concept. Had to take the unit back because of it. although I like the torch, camera & radio.",
            "This phone is very good.easy to use large keys easy to see",
            "Got this phone for my dad to use, he keeps it in his pocket so wanted a flip up so he wouldn't be making any unwanted calls! It's got large buttons so he can see very clearly when dialling, very clear sound for the hard of hearing. Would definitely recommend for someone of a certain age, as it's very easy to use.",
            "Good product for a good price. Easy to set up and use. Is sim free, which is great, exactly what was needed as had a sim already. Purchased for someone who just needed a simple phone to use rather than a smart phone.",
            "Nice easy phone to use.",
            "I BOUGHT TIS ITEM FOR MY PARTNER AS HE IS NOT GOOD WITH TOUCH PHONES, HE IS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ONE AS EASY TO USE.",
            "It has taken me some time to get used to the features in this mobile, rather different from my previous one. I am gradually speeding up and find it convenient for my needs, ie texts and phone calls. I have little use for the camera which it also has, but I think it needs some memory card to enable it to be used.\nThe instruction manual is quite good, but rather brief in places",
            "EXCELLENT MOBLIE PHONE. I bought this for my dad because its simple and very easy to use. It has larger buttons than the cheaper Alba phone listed at argos. You can end the call by closing it up which makes it a lot better if ya prone to forgetting to end a call or accidently catching the 999 button when the phone is in ya pocket.",
            "Easy to use I by for my mum she likes the phone",
            "it does what it says on the tin. its a phone with no fancy gadgets",
            "My mother in law was very happy with that. \nSpecially for bigbotton keys & open to receive calls future.",
            "Overall was quite pleased with phone, very slim and light, voice call clarity better than expected doesn't show name on incoming message. Also has charging cradle to stand phone in .Jim",
            "Is a good phone. Just one problem cannot send mms texts",
            "basic phone which is all i need\nsmall size is perfect for me,easy to set up, volume is ok so can hear caller ok"
