            "Talk to everyone with the latest Nokia 105. Weeks of battery life will help you stay connected even longer, while the modern, ergonomic design will ensure you remain comfortable however long the conversation lasts. The polycarbonate body gives you style and substance, while the inherent colour helps to minimize visible scratches. There's room for thousands of contacts and hundreds of SMS. And when you're not talking, you can play a few games or relax with the radio. There's also a built-in flashlight to help you light the way if required. "

            "Bought this phone to keep in my pocket at work rather than risk damaging my smartphone. So mainly used to receive calls and text. Battery last over a week between charges. Call quality is reasonable but not that loud. The main reason I give it 4 stars is that the navigation key is not so good as the previous version of this phone. When scrolling it often thinks you have pressed the button. So for example if you were playing Snake the game keeps pausing and you have to press to start again.\nPhone seems durable and is lightweight. The FM radio is good but you have to use a pair of headphones for the antenna which isn't supplied. Shame the phone comes with some trial games that can't be uninstalled.\nFor my usage the phone is good and I am pleased with it. Remember because it is only 2G the Three mobile is not compatible.",

The only problem I have had with it is that I have struggled with the keys, to get enough pressure to engage and then get off the key quickly enough before it has shot through to another function. Perhaps I have fat finger syndrome. Will probably get the hang of it. If I had to buy another phone I would definitely get a Nokia again but just not this particular model.",

The battery life is amazing, it lasts up to a week on a single charge and only takes 10-20 minutes to recharge which is crazy. The only flaw I've noticed is the interactive touch pad is a little small meaning sometimes you can easily miss click. This is a very minor flaw, Overall great phone for all ages!

But the menu button is vague and difficult to be precise on. You end up in settings when you wanted messages. The older phone it was replacing (another Nokia of a similar design) was much more accurate with the menu button. Can't understand how such a poorly designed button could get through the development stage tbh.",

            "Predictive text doesn’t work properly. Pressing *key should bring up alternative words to that first selected by the phone but actually takes you straight to symbols. So you can’t change the word the phone selects.Quite a serious flaw and rated down accordingly. Also the scroll key is a bit slippery and difficult to control.

            "If, like me, you have a partner who is a) a technophobe and b) has an uncanny ability to lose phones then this is for you. Does what it needs to ie makes and recieves calls and texts, and doesn't need charging every day. Once a week seems to be fine. Just got a giffgaff payg sim and off you go.",
            "Bought this phone to replace my old Nokia phone. Easy to use for someone who is not used to smart phones.",
            "Bought this very basic phone and a SIM for when my overseas family and friends visit me. Not everyone from abroad has compatible mobiles or plans with the UK so this has come in very handy. Nothing snazzy about this phone but they can communicate with me when they are out and about and that's all I require. It will.also be a good emergency mobile when the fancy touch screen ones have given up as they all seem to inevitably do.",
            "I bought this as a replacement phone for my 86 year old Nan. She wanted something as similar as possible to her old phone. She is really happy with it, nice and simple to use :)",
            "This phone is an ideal basic phone perfect for just calls and texts with a clear screen, clear sound functionality and generally easy to use. It has the usual handy applications such as a torch, alarm and calculator. It has no internet functionality. It is superior in quality compared with alternative basic phones which should be expected given that this is made by Nokia. I would recommend it if a basic phone is required.",
            "If you need a phone to simply make and receive calls without fuss, this is the one. Straight to the point old school phone.",

            "If you only want to send and receives call and texts then this is the one for you.  Battery life lasts 2 weeks on standby which is very good.",
            "Good basic cheap phone.  Didn't expect much and didn't get it.  No nice surprises or anything.  Can't see what the use of 3G is when the phone is only used for phone calls and texts. Note -  I found it really fiddly to get the SIM card into the correct place and even took the phone back for a replacement because it was not recognising it the first time.  Used as a spare for husband and he is very happy with it as the power saving is so good.",

            "I needed a phone with a long battery life for my second SIM card. You can't get anything better for this price, I can assure you. You don't get many extras, apart from what's expected from a phone - calls and texts... and hey there is an FM radio, I love that!",
            "This is the 5th one I havebought for my family member.",
            "This is a simple 'no frills' phone that makes and receives calls and texts - all I need from a mobile phone. It was competitively priced, it uses the standard SIM card from my previous phone, it is easy to operate, it doesn't require regular charging, and (I'm told) can be used throughout most of the world (with the exception of Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago). Highly recommended for those that don't want contemporary complexity!!!",

Ipartly picked it as I wanted to use the micro sim I already had but although this phone was described as taking that size, it actually requires a mini sim. I could have got around this but the phone proved temperamental and didn't wish to turn on after a an extremely short while. Returned next day. Not impressed!",
            "Bought this for my son as it is sim free but his sim card was G4 only (generation 4 format ) The phone is G2 format. The G2 sim cards are hard to find as the system is being fazed out. Gifgaf came to the rescue. Tried to change the phone at Argos the next day. Total refusal as they said it had been USED. How are you supposed to test it? Bottom line is they will not take back mobile phones once packet is opened so beware.",
            "My wife wanted a simple mobile phone and this phone is just perfect.",

            "Basic phone, works well for talking, nothing surprising, good as backup/emergency device. Texting is oldschool step selection with buttons.\nBattery life is great compared to smartphones, BUT falls short of the advertised, lasted about 10 days on the first charge with some talking and seems to be shorter the second charge (had it just over 3 weeks)\nButtons feel nice but wouldn’t recommend for users with stiff fingers.",

I simply needed a phone which can handle calls and text messaging to last me a couple of months, so this fitted the bill nicely. It's a very simple phone, with a small but clear display. There's no camera or internet, but the battery lasts forever (10 days so far and only half drained).\nNote: Needs a mini sim card.",
