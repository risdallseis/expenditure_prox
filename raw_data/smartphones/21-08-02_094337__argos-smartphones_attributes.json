            "I bought the g8 for my daughter last year and this is the updated slightly larger screen . It updated to the latest Android shortly after I turned it on so it's slightly better than as sold. No complaints still learning the new Android set up . Have lots of photos and huge memory some have pointed out you can't store apps on sd  card  just photos on",
            "My last dual SIM Motorola was about 3 or 4 years old and the battery was getting tired so replaced with this.\n\nChose the 'power' over the 'plus' as travel a lot for work and not bothered about the better screen resolution of the plus. Big screen, good camera, brilliant battery (I'm getting 3 full days between charges)\n\nPerfect for me",
            "Yes it's the best phone do the job",
            "I'm so happy with this phone. It's a good size, holds its charge for 2 days, easy to use and navigate, clear crisp screen and comes with clear protection case. Couldn't ask for more.",
            "Nice phone with lovely clear screen. Good photos. Took me a week to get to grips with it as I'm not used to a smart phone. Only problem is the amount of rubbish both Google and Motorola keep sending. Had to get my son to limit how much was coming through.",
            "I bought this for my son who wanted better battery and a larger screen so he’s happy.",
            "Phone is very very heavy,not prefert but does the job..",
            "Have been using this phone for 3 weeks. I can easily go 3 full days without recharging. I have dropped a star because of difficulty in seeing the screen in any outdoor brightness. Apart from that, very good indeed. My second Motorola phone.",
            "I bought this a few weeks ago for my mum birthday and I'm so happy , great battery life,  huge screen with extra cover,  great for picture ,  huge memory,  easy to use , my mum usually used iphone 6 but this one was a good choice thanks",

            "I bought this for my daughter. She loves the phone for its\nbattery life and storage.",
            "The Moto g9 power is well constructed and pleasing to hold, though it is a little heavier than most phones. It's powered with a 6mah battery, which seems to last for ever, so charging is massively reduced and fully charges in about two hours. The phones dimensions do tend to make it a little bulky, but they are still comparable to other leading manufacturers. \n Overall this is an excellent phone at an affordable price.",
            "Phone easy to use, good features, large memory and battery lasts 3 days between charging. \nSupplied with silicon case, but screen protector needs to be bought separately.\nPhone is a bit larger and heavier than previous phone, but same with all android phones now.",

            "It isn’t amazing phone my daughter is so happy Thanks Argos",
            "I was looking at a new phone as I had a buyer for my old phone. Once set up, it became apparent that it worked a bit differently from my old phone. For example, the screen filled up with notifications and obscured the lock screen. Took some figuring out how to prevent the phone telling me how to use it. On the positive side, it’s fast, good battery life and the Bluetooth works properly.",
            "I love Motorola phones this one is no exception, positives quick ,easy to use , large internal memory for apps , large clear screen, and four cameras , which I'm still trying to get used to , photos have been really clear though ,,long battery life and quick charge ,, issues for me is it's huge and a little heavy due to the double battery,, and reacts very quickly to exiting pages, which is a swipe , took me a little time to handle that , but I'm happy",
            "Phone is very good and very reasonable price for giving four star because its signl antena is low",
            "Quick processing and long battery life ideal for my music streaming",
            "128GB which is good decent camera and a large screen all I wanted",
            "Bought this for my hubby as his moaning about his old moto g4 was driving me mad. Took him a few days to get used to it as he isn't at all technical and now he loves it. It's much faster and the camera seems pretty good. He mainly uses social media and WhatsApp so it's brilliant for that. It's quite large compared to his old phone. I think it's very good value for the money.",
            "Decent phone with excellent specs for a really good price.",
            "It is a good looking phone , a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  The screen is great . Camera is a bit of a let down but not terrible. \nVery happy overall.",

            "great phone with a good camera easy to use",
            "The Motorola G9 is an amazing phone far better than I expected it is more than a phone really it's a great camera and great computer and gaining device it teaches you how to use the functions quickly,and offer's a nice size screen for viewing movie's with plenty of memory space and battery life.\nTop quality phone from a top quality company\nThanks Motorola",
            "I read lots of reviews before settling on this phone, and I'm glad I did. My previous phone had proved unreliable, and I hoped this would be an improvement. It is! It's a large 6.8\" screen but it doesn't feel too big in your hand as it's taller rather than wider than my previous phone. It comes with a case, but I wasn't confident in the fit of that so I bought a better one. All in all I'm very happy.",
            "So I have been putting the phone through its paces. Seems to have unlimited memory.... Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a mid level smart phone. It plays games flawlessly. Camera isn't that great but good enough in low light to take pics. Looks great. Streams to my chrome cast. Google pay works. All I need really.",
            "Bought as a replacement for my son - colour states blue but it is definitely deep purple so not as expected. He didn't mind as a black case solved it.\n\nGreat battery and fast processor speed. Can't fault it at all.",
            "Amazing battery life - Lasts ages and charges quickly! Split screen works great since the screen is so big. Only three stars because phone is too big, cumbersome and heavy. It can make my hand achy after holding it for a while!  Furthermore, the display isn't vivid. Colours are dull even on the brightest setting. During calls, I could hear person on other end but they couldn't hear me. Not a signal issue since same SIM worked fine in different device. Must have been faulty. Returned for refund",
            "Good phone very grateful battery life . but a little bit heavy.i think because of the battery. \nThe phone is deserve to be invited in to your account.",
            "Thothing bad about the device  it works very well\nAnd it is definitely my best buy good tech thank\nYou argos for such a good device",
            "Good product in good price",
            "I have had this Motorola go power for 2 weeks now \nWhat a great phone it is. Bright and clear screen, great camera, lots of storage and the battery is lasting four days at least.  It gives more expensive phones a run for their money.",
            "Perfect size ,got everything you need on a phone!!",
            "The phone does exactly what it says it will and is well worth the money. Storage is amazing and the battery life is outstanding. Very happy and would definitely recommend for someone on a budget",
            "I am pleased with my new phone longer than I thought but getting used to it good price takes great photos",
            "It is the best affordable smart phone with 128GB internal memory. The camera is absolutely brilliant too. No regrets in buying this phone. I'm loving it.",

            "The price was very good. \nCustomer service was so polite.",

            "Nice phone,good quality of display.",
            "Superb phone. The battery lasts easily for 2 days with my usage and charges full from around 15% to 100% in less than 2 hours. The camera is fantastic, and the weight of the phone is lighter than previous Motorolas. If you're a fan of android this is a great phone, highly recommend.",
            "Very good phone.Argos is the best!",
            "Bought this for my son first time I've brought this make and so glad I did its one of the best phones I've ever bought it's battery life is superb the memory if great  super value for money and the phone itself looks really sleek and it came with a clear gel protective cover all in all I would 100% definitely buy again if I needed another phone for the family or myself",
            "Taking a while to getting used to it and how to navigate it (upgraded from a Samsung) \nIs big,  good for videos etc but a bit heavy and harder to hold than a smaller phone. \nGood quality screen . Good battery life. \nNo problems so far. Good phone. \nComes with a basic back cover, i bought a new one to protect it more",
            "Fantastic phone does everything we want bought for my wife so we can keep in contact while she is in hospital",
            "My last Lenovo phone was dying and I wanted a replacement with a good battery life as my Lenovo was excellent. This isn't quite as good battery-wise but it is one of the better ones available. It is quite heavy and chunky but I am happy with that as I work on a farm and it gets quite badly treated. Easy to use and nice large screen. I don't see the point in paying more for a phone - this provides everything I need. Would recommend.",
            "This phone is amazing for the price. It does everything you need and Is easy to use. I love the colour and it comes with a silicone case.  The battery is incredible. The only downside is that is is very long so doesn't fit in my small carry purse and is heavy.",
            "I needed urgently to replace my phone and arrived next day . Easy to set up. Good value for price.",
            "Excellent for the price it's nice and big with excellent storage does everything I need it for would definitely recommend people to purchase this phone.",
            "Needed smart phone as you cannot do so many things without one, e.g. store apps, make payments, check the internet while out and about etc. Did a lot of research and decided that this was the model for me. I am a pensioner and do not need an £800 phone. This phone offers excellent value for money, is a good size [large], and appears to be well made. I am very happy with the phone after a brief period of two weeks and anticipate I will continue to be pleased with the phone ongoing",
            "Three day battery clear screen easy set up basic phone good enough camera. Great price",
            "I am happy to have a at Motorola company.Is a best phone.",

            "It's good battery power",
            "Great price for a great phone, ace battery life, massive screen for watching Netflix and YouTube.\n\nOnly small downside is that the phone is a bit big for my hands, so would recommend a phone case with a ring attached for stability.",
            "Great value for money. Battery lasts 48hrs+ and that's with plenty of use too.  I cannot argue for the price. Downside is large battery makes for large phone, but if you can live with that then you're onto a winner.",
            "Great phone, great shortcuts and suggestions, only issue so far is with GPS not keeping up with maps when driving",
            "Was happy I choose this phone. Easy to use and lovely size. I can watch Netflix, receive emails, camera works very well. Overall 10 out of 10 for me. Thank you Argos for selling this reasonable and price wise value for money.",
            "Really pleased with this mobile phone which replaced a Moto 8 version.  Bigger screen which is great for looking at photos / video.  I'm not a game player but the rest of the phones specification are more than enough to meet my usage.  The battery is really good and is quick to charge.  For the price this is an excellent phone and one I happy to recommend.",
            "I was going to buy a much more expensive phone and I’m glad my local store didn’t had it stock as this phone is probably as good and it cost just 1/3 of the price I would usually spend. It’s a little on the bigger side and doesn’t fit fully in my pocket but it doesn’t bother me that much. Camera makes a really good photos, even at night. Battery last couple of days which is a big plus. Highly recommend this phone to anyone!",
            "Excellent  phone easy to use Great larger screen would recommend",
            "I bought this as my sony phone had broken.  It is a lot larger than my previous phone and doesn't fit well in a pocket or handbag but i guess that's the same for most phones around at the moment.  Camera not as sharp as my old sony and the lack of gorilla glass was disappointing. On the plus side the battery is huge and lasts twice as long as my old phone.  Screen is responsive and  overall it seems a good budget phone for the money.",
            "Everything was perfect and I liked the service completely happy",
            "Very nice and excellent",
            "I bought this to replace my old Moto G7 Power and it certainly feels like an easy move from one to the other. The same things I like about this phone as with my G7 are its excellent battery life and storage, for very decent value for money. The large display is very helpful and you quickly get used to it, so it doesn't feel so big. It's very smart .",
            "This model is top end of the  budget phones,  It' heavier than most to get long battery life, so far it's dropped less than 10% a day, not that I am heavy user, mainly phone and text  just the odd internet search/E-mail.. \nScreen size is larger than some and good if not the best resolution but more than adequate.\n  Set up was a challenge, defaulting to gesture control ,  guide was only 4 pages in English and full size, all 4 fitting on one side of a A5 sheet, download the 220 page guide first.",
            "Easy to use fast and responsive",
            "This is my back up for work, as needed to use an alternative to my personal one, for professional calls. This is a great item, large screen, fast switch on and easy to navigate. The memory is large for a cheaper mobile, but can extended to 512 gb with a memory card. Thinking of using this as my main mobile,  in the future if my usual one fails. Worth buying, as a main mobile, especially if your on a budget. Delivery was swift, and Covid safe.",
            "Fantastic purchase after 1 month of owning I've not found a fault ..mi used to have iPhones and Samsung's note this is easily equal to them....but at fraction of cost...the battery is amazing and camera is wkd ....love the big screen aswell",
            "Heavy phone but has a big battery so to be expected.\nNice big screen camera is really good .",
            "I bought this phone as it was time I had a new phone. It's less expensive and I really like the colour and the features but still learning how to operate the phone. I recommended  this product to a family friend as I thought it was a good phone. I hope to explore the features in the phone and get to know how it works.",
            "Very pleased with this phone. The camera is great and battery life is Brilliant. Can't believe the price compared to my iPhone and struggling to justify having the iPhone now!",
            "A good decent user friendly mobile. Perfect for my needs.",
            "My daughter liked it",
            "On par if not better than my old P20 Pro that it has replaced",
            "Great service and product from Argos",
            "So far this phone seems to have been a good buy and working well. Camera seems very good quality for a not too expensive phone.",
            "The 64mp camera is amazing, pictures are absolutely brilliant. The screen is perfect being so big it's great for watching YouTube and scrolling through social media apps. The 6000 mah battery makes this device a powerhouse I'm currently getting 2 full days use from one charge. Great phone can't recommend it enough.",

            "Fast phone reliable good features long lasting battery",
            "Great 2/3 day battery from full charge. Large 128GB built in memory which can be expanded further.All apps run quickly. The addition of NFC over previous versions adds to the usability. Camera is perfectly adequate for my requirements. Overall an excellent phone with capabilities way above its budget price.",

            "Huge screen great battery 2 days with a single charge great camera great value for the money really",
            "I bought this as a replacement for my old phone, the memory is very good, as is the battery life and very fast charging, it's quite a big phone but easily manageable in your hand. The screen picture is clear with plenty of adjustable features, however the camera/video is a big disappointment, close range and normal range it's fine but when using the 8 times magnification it becomes pointless as it is too grainy and fuzzy to be of any use. I don't know why they even put this feature on this phone",
            "As in the title fantastic phone!\nBattery life is the best I've ever had.\nThe phone is very easy to use. Very quick responses.\nGreat colour. \nLove it\nHighly recommended",
            "Love this phone it looks great and has ample of storage",

            "a robust phone , with a crisp screen does everything I need . Camera is a 7 out of 10 and struggles in poor lighting other than that very happy",
            "Great phone conects to the Internet really fast . Has a brilliant size screen.  Apps work great too . It looks amazing too. Would definitely recommend  Motorola G9 Power 128GB Mobile Phone .",
            "Very good smart phone, does what it says on the tin, so far as I only had it a week. Big screen very handy.",
            "The phone,was abit slow for my liking,but for the price,was so so,and the colour,it's purple,not blue,but I shall Carry on with it,but no I would say to friends about it,",

            "Had to return this phone to Argos for a refund.\nKept dropping calls in my house, very frustrating.\nTried absolutely everything that Motorola suggested, no joy. Otherwise very well made phone, good value, very long battery life.",
            "Years since I have had a Motorola mobile , but so far this one is nice and seems quite responsive. Not had the chance to really test the camera yet but it has plenty of settings so hopeful it is going to be good.",
            "This phone is easy to set up and easy to use.   I think it is great value for money for a smart phone and the large screens means it is easy to use.  It was promptly delivered as promised so great service and I would recommend to anyone.",
            "The phone has good battery life. Responds well. Two sim card slots but was a lot larger than I anticipated couldn't exchange due to broken seal. Hadn't used it in any way",
            "Great value price. Does everything you need at a decent speed. Much better value than all the high end mobiles.",
            "the price for the product is very good, good to use, and the battery is great",
            "Very impressive battery life. \n\nBig screen. \n\nThe ' back ' action via swiping left on the screen is good BUT it can also let you accidentally deleting or archiving emails.. just to be aware\n\nIt's a heavy phone due to the big battery, so if you want a lightweight phone this is not for you. \n\nIf you want superb battery life, USB type C with fast charging then this is perfect.",
            "I bought it for my family member.  She is so happy",
            "Easy to upgrade from old phone",

            "This is a phone with lots of processing power, long lasting battery, and plenty of internal storage and a capable camera. This phone was on sale for a very competitive price and very quick availability from my local Argos. \n\nI would recommend this product to anyone wanting excellent performance for well under £ 200.",
            "Excellent value for money. Screen is huge and battery lasts a very long time.",
            "Love this phone. Fast.great quality.easy to use. Takes excellent photos. Slightly bigger than previous phone. Great price, great storage capacity,fast charging. Not one fault found as yet this phone.",
            "Fast, reliable, display lovely never had battery like it. Android 10 very custamisable so a very simple product but Intelligent. Case and screen protectors cheap on Amazon. Quite big and heavy tough so will limit one handed use for people with smaller hands as no one handed mode. 64 mp camera great for normal people taking normal photos. Speaker average so fine mid volume but Tinney on high",
            "Comes fully charged and with free gel case out of the box! Works very well, much faster than my last android. Battery lasts up to 4days on a full charge, around 8hours screen-on time. Camera is crisp and sharp. Excellent piece of tech for the price, highly recommended",
            "Great phone.  Perfect for me",
            "I bought this phone after breaking my old G7. Immediately I was greeted with a familiar quality feeling and the features I expect from and Android and Motorola phone. The setup was fast bringing over all my settings from the old phone. \nBattery life has already got to 4 days, which far surpasses the competition.\nThe camera is excellent but needs careful setting up to get the best from it. It is fully manual if you need it.\nOverall, good in parts, excellent in others.",
            "Very good cheap phone good battery and good intern memory",
            "I bought this phone for my son, he love it and it's a good budget phone. camera, features are perfect.",
            "Wow, what a great phone.  It does all that you need plus more.  The battery life is phenomenal. So pleased and at a great price.  So not worth getting the named big brands.",
            "For a budget phone the specs are good. Only had it for 2 weeks. Slight lag using some heavier apps. Battery is excellent though even compared to top end. Won't connect to my TV out of the box for some reason. Bit bulky. Still for its price would recommend.",
            "Good value with lots of memory. Holds a good battery charge but not as quick on charging as I thought it would be. Bit large and heavy for pocket use.",
            "excellent value for money if you are looking for a phone with long battery life from the reliable motorola brand you cant go wrong with this phone .this phone i bought for my daughter and she is very happy with it.plus it has 128 gb memory at a very good price .down side is the no return/back sign on the phone but thats the new andriod 11 for you you have to swipe the screen to go back/return to a previous menue/ page.i will buy a motorola phone myself  motorola edge s 5g best budget 5g phone.",
            "This is a great phone that does everything the more expensive phones do for just a fraction of the price. The phone is fast and really easy to use. Just 2 things I'm not keen on...the camera quality could be a little sharper but I do like the beautifying feature on the camera when taking selfies. Also Google have removed Google music and now you have to use YouTube Music which is an awful app. To upload your own music on that takes hours. But that's it.",
            "Fast, great battery life and camera. Who needs an iPhone when the G9 is available at this price?  Not me any more.",
            "Firstly buying from Argos on click and collect took all of 30 minutes and their store is 15 mins away!\nThe phone is brilliant for the money and whilst I am no technical genius, it seems to do everything I will ever need.\n2nd Motorola and no issues with either, just buy one and save a fortune. I have a sim only deal which is £10 per month so I am not paying silly monthly fees to have the latest mobile and buying the phone outright makes sense.",
            "Great product and easy klick and collect",
            "Good dual sim phone, Clear screen, Battery life good. Processor speedy. Android 10 will be upgraded and kept upto date. Google makes carry over of apps and setting from old phone easy. Very pleased with this Moto G9 power.",

            "Great value for money, unlocked so any sim card will work and also come with a plastic case for it",
            "Decided to purchase this.got home,set it up.but discovered a problem when calling.after a few seconds people the other end couldn't hear me.so took it back,exchanged it for same model,but sadly the same again.so took that back and changed for a different brand.maybe I was just unlucky with the 2 I picked up.so I can't give a review on features and battery as I never got that far.",
            "A good phone. It's big and gives good screen size.",
            "After much research I chose the G9 power. So far so good. A vast improvement on my G6. Graphics seem fine so far. Vast storage. Excellent battery life. Have not found anything to fault it on so far. Suits my needs perfectly.",
            "Very nice phone for the price",
            "I wanted a relatively cheap phone with a large screen and nfc, for Google pay. This phone does the job plus has plenty of storage and a reasonable  camera. The screen bright enough although the resolution is only HD but good enough for me. \nThe battery lasts for ages, best phone for battery life that I've had.",

            "Really good battery. I bought this phone for work. Battery keeps all day. Working fast and camera best quality",
            "This phone works great, good camera, long battery life and very stylish. It doesn't seem to have a compass so some of the apps used previously don't seem to work, but this isn't a deal-breaker. Great phone for a great price.",
            "Spent more than I originally wanted to, pleased I did as I am very happy with this phone, easy to use, good camera.\nDescribed as blue on Argos website but the colour I received was Electric Violet, fine for me but just so others aware.",
            "Had iPhone 8 didn't bother or wanted to have another 2 years paying 60£\nHad a Realme x50 5g cost 300£, battery was terrible ! Sent it back go went for the G9 Power\nSeriously don't succumb to peer pressure and feel the need to skint yourself with a high end iPhone or Samsung \nThis does everything I'm sure 95% of the population needs \nCamera good for what I need including macro lens \nMassive memory 128 which is expandible if you ever needed more\nComplete bargain.",
            "Great phone, really good battery life and performance in general for the price. It's quite large, but other than that it's great",
            "The long life battery is worth all the money.",
            "With a maximum budget of £200, there were plenty of phones to choose from. My key criteria were camera, screen size, battery life and performance. The Moto G9 Power won the day and I'm really pleased with my purchase and the speed at which I could click and collect from Argos in my local Sainsbury's was amazing as in a couple of hours. Phone is simple to set up, apps load super fast and the turbo charge means 100% battery very quickly attained and this is good for a couple of days, brilliant.",
            "Excellent phone, 2nd Moto, replacing a G5. 5 dys now still not charged still at 25% Big clear screen, not much bloat stuff instlled",
            "Good service from gloucester team. Phone is good quicker than my last phone. Battery lasts well, however it has google assistant installed. After disabling anything to do with the assistant I could not use the phone the key board had also disappeared!!!!!\nLooked on line and found this was a common complaint. All the suggestions didn't work but I did find somewhere on the phone where you could just reset the apps. Yippee phone now works ok.\nIf you love google assistant then ok .",
            "Upgraded from Moto power G7 and I love this phone. Does all I need it to do and very responsive. It is quite large and heavy but I've got big hands so quite like a large screen.The fingerprint scan doesn't always work but it has face recognition which is handy.Camera is very good, like the macro camera.Lots of memory,more than enough Very easy to transfer all my data onto new phone,everything transferred over which is a first.",
            "The phone is brilliant for the price highly recommend would definitely buy again",
            "On the hole a great phone. I'm not that teck savvy, but found the phone easy to use and set up. It was simple to access data from Google Drive. The Battery life is impressive, I only need to charge it once every other day, despite streaming and using social media for hours every day. Its quite heavy & big, I have had to get a Phone Ring Holder to put on the back this makes it easier to hold. It still fits in my jeans pockets. I have found that if the signal is patchy it may disconnect calls.",
            "I can hardly believe this is a budget phone. It's a bit thicker than my previous phone, but that is due to the battery. Fingerprint scanner works great, screen is big and bright. Battery life could maybe push to to 2 days of medium use, and longer with light use.\nWould heartily recommend this phone",
            "The phone is slick, clean and quick - not what I was expecting for a mid range phone. Its battery life is great, and I really can't seem to fault it. I am used to wider phones, so it seemed a bit 'thin and long' when I first purchased it - but just check out the dimensions if you're worried.",
            "I find this mobile easy to get the hang of, which is always a concern when I change it. I even managed to download my contacts from Samsung! The battery life is terrific, it lasts for days and the camera great too.  However, the Motorola description is correct when it says Violet - which is the colour I wanted, and the Argos description is incorrect saying blue or silver.",

It's one-third of common brand phones price but it's fast and has lots of ability! It's screen is abit bigger then iPhone 11 and I'm happy about that because I don't need to watch movie or read books with my iPad anymore. I'm happy of this purchase.",
