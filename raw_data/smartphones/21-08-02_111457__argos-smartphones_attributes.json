            "Me and my 6 friends went on holiday to Mallorca. One morning we decided to rent a boat and have a small trip around the coast. Fortunately during the trip waves were big enough to soak everyone's back packs with water. Because my phone is like 2 months old, I decided to hold it in my hand instead of wet back pack. Middle day the see started going crazy and at some point waves started getting  inside our boat. We immediately tried to get back to the closest shore but... It was too late. Lots of water got on board. We had to jump out and seconds later boat was upside down. We were too far from the shore to just swim, but luckily for us, boat was still floating on water so we had something to grab to. I was the only one who still had phone in the hand. I climbed on the boat and started calling help. 1 mile from shore. Open see. Absolutely wet - this phone managed to give me a 10 minutes call to 112, connect with them via what'sapp and send them our live location. 30 minutes later we have been picked by rescue boat. If that phone wouldn't be waterproof, or just break down idk what would happen to me and 6 of my friends. Did I mention that idk how to swim?",

            "While the Galaxy S20, with its elongated display and compact size, is more suitable for people with small hands, the Galaxy S20 + is larger and wider, which means it will appeal to fans of huge diagonals. Interestingly, at 188 grams, it is much lighter than the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. The smartphone fits well in the hand and surprises with a small thickness of 7.8 mm. True, the rear camera module still protrudes noticeably from the body.\n\nA protective Gorilla Glass 6 is installed on both sides of the case, which surpasses the previous version in strength. Despite Samsung's tweaks of beautiful gradients, the smartphone is quickly covered in fingerprints and smudges. The front and rear panels are connected by a metal frame, the joints are smooth and invisible. The build quality is excellent.\n\nThe smartphone is protected from dust and moisture according to the IP68 standard, so you can not be afraid of rain.\n\nI would like to use the ultra version, but too expensive. :)",

            "The camera and UI of the phone are really good. It is enjoyable to use and very intuitive. However, this phone has some shortcomings, the battery life is shocking for a flagship phone. 120Hz display mode is a battery killer and cannot be used if you are out all day. The fingerprint unlock is cumbersome and not the best. I have tried deleting and re-adding fingerprints and it still at times does not unlock or takes time to unlock. These two features of battery life and fingerprint scanner would lead me to recommend checking other flagship phones before choosing this. Overall, disappointed in Samsung. For a high price and a flagship phone you would hope for better.",

            "I was initially hesitant to buy this phone with the screen being 6.7 inches however the tiny bezels all around make it the perfect size for my hands and pockets. The 120 Hz refresh rate makes scrolling, animations and gameplay super smooth and not jittery - once you try it you'll realise how slick it is. It's really quick installing/opening apps and updates. One feature that I really didn't give too much through to when buying this phone was how rapidly it charges! It has super fast charging so a 30 min charge adds around 50% more battery which is really convenient when you need a quick top up. It has 4 cameras -  main, telephoto, ultra wide and one for portrait shots (blur) which produce beautiful photos and videos. And it's 5G capable so it's future proof too. \n\nIn the past Samsung had a poor track record with security updates but now they're really swift, and even quicker than Google in some instances. \nThe new 'One UI 2' user interface makes navigation easy and effortless. It's really light and not at all cluttered like the dark TouchWiz days *shiver*. Owning a Samsung since the Galaxy S3 I can attest to how far Samsung has come.\nIf you own other Samsung products you will appreciate how seamless it is interacting with them. It takes mere seconds to cast my phone to my TV to watch a video or mirror my screen with the connection being stable. \n\nIf you're still deliberating, definitely go with the S20+ - you won't be disappointed!",

            "- Buttery smooth experience. 120hz screen really elevates the gaming experience. \n- Camera is top class. I am a bad photographer. But the camera is so beautifully optimized that photos that even I take are gorgeous.\n- phone does not lag at all. \n- full day of battery life and more.\n- only minor issue if any, would be with biometrics. I wish it was a bit more responsive. Sometimes it takes me more than 2 tries to unlock phone with fingerprint. But I guess it will get better in a few days.",

            "This is my 2nd samsung S20+ within a week. First one went back after 2 days because of network issues, turns out to be the phone was causing the issue. New phone arrived and the problem fixed. This time the power and volume button is loose/moving. Also I have been very careful with the phone, always been on a counter top, and normally put it in a pocket with nothing else in. The other day I put it in the same pocket as my plastic key fob for my car (No key ring on it, or metal on the fob, plastic all round) and it has caused a deep scratch to the screen. Other phones can survive scratches directly to the screen from a Stanley knife, and this gets scratches from plastic......... Won't be buying samsung again",
            "I love the Galaxy S20+ BTS version because it's design is a beautiful purple, with a beautiful purple theme to go with it. It has the most gorgeous notification tune and ringtone. I also admire the extra facilities that came with the phone: BTS XR Snapshot, AR Zone. The phone also came with a free phone case with a clear film and stickers to decorate with. It also arrived with photocards of all members. The camera is epic because it allows you to zoom out and zoom in a significant amount. I have got some gorgeous shots using this camera. Absolutely adore this phone!",

            "never had an urge for Samsung but now I wouldn't have any other device",
            "really good phone up to now has added safety features from old one",
            "Poor camera quality and not much better than s9. wish I had stuck with old phone.",
            "I love the S20+ there this so much  features. Also I love  wireless powershare  it so helpful when I need to charge up my Samsung galaxy watch or my family phone. I love the camera",
            "upgraded from a Samsung galaxy s8 which was good but the s20 is excellent especially the camera would recommend. Being a plus model still easy to hold .",
            "Finally upgraded by s8 to this s20 & well worth it. The 120hz refresh makes a big difference. Overall phone is bigger  but you do get used to it quick - it will be hard to go back to a smaller phone.",
            "Perfect device, nice camera, design, display awsome 4k videos! A beast Ram!",
            "little bit should be less price",
            "Phone overheats constantly when used in my car, I use my phone as a dash cam while driving as I did with my previous S8+, and it overheats, stops charging and closes the app all the time, my old S8+ was able to do this, run google maps and play music all at the same time, but this phone cannot even function as a dash cam without overheating, the fingerprint sensor on the screen is also a lot worse than the S8+. since an update last week, it has also started unlocking itself in my pocket, the problem has now become so bad that I have had to stop using the fingerprint sensor altogether.",
            "The Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus is a nearly-perfect smartphone that connects to more 5G networks and has better cameras than ever, though you’ll be paying for the privilege, as this is the priciest Plus smartphone yet. I don’t mind ho-hum design, the phone handles anything you throw at it, and should last me years - especially assuming 5G networks stay compatible with the S20 Plus as they build out.",
            "yes, s20+ its my perfect match for me, that big memory rar its amazing , I can play alot of games .",
            "I've always used Samsung Phones, The S9 I had before the S20 was more user friendly, My main Gripe is when Charging there is no warning lights. The S9 had a warning light that was red while charging and green when fully charged, You knew when the phone was charged so you could remove the charger. It also flashed Blue if there was a missed call or message. The S20 doesn't have this feature",
            "very good phone fully loaded",
            "Great phone love Samsung lots, amazing camera",
            "Had an S10 before I purchased the S20+ and loved that phone. Camera quality is excellent and feels really well made. I decided this time to get the plus and was abit worried due to having small hands that it may be too big but u didnt need to worry as its perfect. Lovely screen size great graphics and excellent sound and picture quality.",
            "I upgraded to the S20+ from the P20 pro. The Samsung is meant to have a larger battery, but i am charging mine more often than I did my Huawei. \n\nThe camera is massively underwhelming. The quality of photos is really disappointing, and the 8K videos are so grainy its awful. I have only managed to take a couple of decent photos, and always outside in plenty of light. Indoors its pointless. And forget about the zoom function, unless you want a photo that looks like it was taken on a potato in 1950!!\n\nThe phone looks and feels lovely, has a very expensive feel to it. The headphones are great quality and have good sound.",
            "I do like Samsung but this seems slow and not so easy to use as what I'm use to, maybe I'm getting too old for newer technology.",
            "REALLY good phone, much better then mine old s8 plus.",
            "just made the switch from everything apple (which I've had for 15 years plus) to everything samsung. S20+ is amazing took all of 1 hour to get completely used to after years of ios the tab s6 lite is a dream ro use, and I'm really impressed with my active watch. Thanks Samsung I couldn't be happier",
            "Love Samsung phones and been buying them for years but I got rid off my S20 plus because of the exynos chip. Not as good as the Snapdragon and if I'm paying good money for it why is Korea and USA getting the better Snapdragon not good enough. So I will have it wait and see if they change this for the European market.",
            "The phone is new, fast and sleek. Downside i the battery doesn't last a long as i expected, but the dual sim is good so i can use it as work prone and personal phone.",
            "For 5G, the coverage is limited, this will improve in the future.\nGot 700 mbps with high band 5G, 100 mbps with low band 5G \n\nThe camera is so versatile with the ultra wide, normal and zoom.\nThe 25W charging is quick but if buying other chargers make sure they are PPS.\nOther fast chargers will work but only upto 15W.\nWireless charging is good but is considerably slower than the wired.\nI don't notice the hole punch while using the device.\nThe 120Hz display is fluid.",
            "I love this phone, upgraded from my s9 plus & I thought that was good. The 2S0 plus is even better, stunning photos, with a 64megapixel chip & great multicamera lense. photographing stars at night is easy, a tripod advised. The Video quality up to 8k, twice as good as 4k is amazing. Long battery life. There probably isnt anything better on the market at this time, other than the s20 Ultra of course. Highly recommended",
            "nice screen size and lovely graphics \nNice photo effects I would recommend this phone all day long",
            "Building on a great phone, I was unsure how Samsung could improve on the S10 Series. I am a fan of the screen quality, 120hz display option, camera and battery life. I was also surprised with the even faster charging ability with the supplied charger.",
            "Looks lovely lightweight lovely screen .",
            "Nice phone, I love it.",
            "Faster than anything I've had previously. I find the galaxy range is always top quality and the flagship devices feel premium in every way.",
            "brilliant phone its quick really good camera",
            "Only disappointing part was the following 48hrs it went down £150. Sure these apps are fixed!\n\nThis is by far the best Samsung I have bought tho. Heavy use im getting a full day battery life (9am to 1am)\n\n Camera is great. I'm a big car nut and love to take pictures. But should have gone the ultra version but couldn't justify the ridiculous price.",
            "I like the big screen. The camera quality is superb.\nIt has lots of features.",
            "i buy this phone last 4 days. If i play any game my baterry is down. And when i want to play pubg in 5 minjtes my phone is burning. In 4 mounth i buy 2 samsung note10+ 5g and this. S20 + 5g have problem's",
            "I purchased my Galaxy S20+ less than one month ago and since then I feel it was a big mistake. I mean the step up in performance is noticeable from the S9 however big price tag on a product that feels cheaply made. Comparing it to my Galaxy S9 the device feels horrendously cheap and unfortunately did not survive its first fall from my pocket from sitting height on a chair as the screen now need replaced at an expensive cost (Samsung Silicon Case used). Accidents do happen unfortunately unlike my S9 which has been through a lot in 2 years, this product couldn't survive a one time drop onto wooden flooring from no more than 1/2 a meter.",
            "only had it a week but so far its seamless and of very high quality",
            "Love the screen to phone size ratio, doesn't feel too big in your hand or pocket.... and the camera is amazing!!",
            "I'm using Samsung smart phones for years. I had Galaxy 2, 4, 6, 9 and finally 20+. So far this is definitely the best one. Screen is amazing, very sharp and responsive. Battery life is surprising. I'm not one of those who plays with the phone all day long but I check my phone fairly often. It takes me two full days to drain the battery. My previous phone (S9) was always below 25% by 8pm everyday.  S20+ looks massive when you check it online but it's not ridiculous. Still fits in the pocket and not awkward to use. Performance is also really good. Never slows down or struggle. There are minor issues I should mention. Fingerprint scanner isn't as responsive as S9, but it's not bad. Still works and does the job. Maybe S9's one was too good (even though the location was weird...). Second minor issues is camera focus. Occasionally it was a having trouble to set the focus correctly but with the last updates it works better. Also I find the colours of the pictures slightly more red/orange compared to others. I added 2 pictures, took a picture of the same chip with S9 and S20. You can do your own judgement. Overall I really like the S20+ and I'd definitely recommend it.",
            "perfect size and weight for such a heavy weight phone!!",
            "The phone looks good and offers both spped and functions to suit my needs.",
            "it takes lovely photos and is light weight absolutely love this phone. The only thing I have to moan about is the fact that I didn't get the watch which was advertised with it",
            "On the whole it's a good phone but on a couple of occasions its shut down my apps because the phone was over heating . I also read reviews stating how good the battery life was, well I have to say how disappointed I've been with battery life. I must admit I've spent a lot of time on my phone during lockdown and one day I had it on the charger 3 times during the day. I like the 120 refresh rate but boy it sucks the life out of the battery.\nI'm not a great photographer but must say the camera is the best of any phone I've had so far.",
            "So far the phone is brilliant,my only trouble have been with the Bluetooth and screen sensitivity. I have had connection problems between the phone and my car, also the screen even with the sensitivity turned down, can pick up random motions such as me holding the phone and think i am pressing the screen",
            "Good upgrade, performance and size.  Less accidental touches but the fingerprint sensor is poor, not powerful enough and needs that extra 0.5 sec to respond",
            "i have been using this phone for a few days now and it is doing everything i need it to do but so quickly and easy. Lucky to live in one of the early citys to have the 5G coverage and so far it is amazing as well",
            "I find this phone is easy to use and much faster to respond than the S9+.\nGaming is much more enjoyable. \nOn the negative side, camera is very sluggish to auto focus and it's annoying that you are unable to charge the phone and listen to headphones simultaneously.   Although this was migrated by the free galaxy buds+",
            "Still trying to get use to it, it's exiting experimenting",
            "I've been using Samsung for years and this phone and the battery is amazing.",
            "the galaxy s20 plus is so much faster than my galaxy s9.super clear and big screen. Camera is great with better features than the s9 im looking forward too lock down being over to take good advantage of the camera. Would of loved to be able yo afford the ultra and see the best of the 20 range",
            "love the phone, but the ear buds supplied with it are poorly designed and with no jack port, i can't plug the excellent s7 plugs in to fully enjoy audio. The new design is just very bizarre and ill fitting\n\nIt's either the plugs, or my own ears....but i can't change those!",
            "Had an S9 previously and the S20 ultra 5g is solo much better. Battery life is excellent. Achieved 267mps download in a park. Also love the wide angle photos which are great for taking pictures indoors (see photo of my child's railway set)",
            "The S20+ is a good size, easy to use and has great up to date features",
            "The S20+ is a good size, easy to use and has great up to date features",
            "I love the screen on this phone, large but still fits in a pocket. The connectivity is awesome, video plays without a hitch even in spotty 4G areas. In its pocket computer mode, this thing is as good as my laptop, times I use it and transfer content to the laptop as its easier to find. All in all, an awesome machine, smooth, slick and fast with the computational abilities to run NASA !",
            "at 1st the phone was brilliant, camera  beyond expections best in the market. Super fast and brilliant screen quality. However over time battery life is not what it is made out to be and phone constantly needs to be charged 2-3 times a day.",
            "Great simplistic design let down by the Exynos 990 which we in the UK get, great as a phone but if your into gaming avoid as this cpu throttles performance hard due to thermal temperature",
            "The camera is brilliant. The best camera I've had on a phone and the latest update has ironed out auto focus issues. I've had Samsung phones for the last ten years, I deviated away for a year but I'm glad I'm back. The phone can handle anything you throw at it. Storage isn't an issue and having a micro sd card is an absolute bonus. Battery life is slightly underwhelming, by no mean terrible, but not amazing, I'd leave a four and a half star review but can only leave four.",
            "the camera is amazing the overall performance of the phone is above anything else I've seen",
            "this is by far the best phone I have had.\nI only buy Samsung products. \nThis phone does everything it says on the tin and more.\nFeatures are great\nScreen displays excellent. \nIs 5g ready,just waiting for my provider virgin to roll it out.",
            "I was looking forward to getting the new S20 plus, thinking the battery would last a lot longer than the S9+, only to have my dreams shattered, pretty disappointed in it to be honest. Turned it down to 60 from 120 on screen settings, turned off apps running, but still no alot of joy.. perhaps SAMSUNG can get in touch to suggest other alternate things to try to improve battery life..",
            "Avid fan of Samsung, got the buds, the watch, had the S9, and believed it would be smart to upgrade. WHAT AN ERROR! It constantly crashes, the speakers sound like you are in a cardboard box, lag on playing the most up-to-date games, and the battery.. jesus don't get me started on that. A twice a day charge. Even when I got my S9 it wasn't doing that at first (when it ended it was four times a day)\n\nI would avoid.",
            "Great Phone, quick and with lots of features.  Easy to set up.  Battery life isn't great and drains quicker when you have the max refresh rate turned on.",
            "This is an amazing phone in almost every aspect, especially the design and the blue colour. However i do have a couple of issues. First off the battery is dire, i have not once got through a day without having to charge it despite the claims that it has two day battery life. Moreover, i find it overheats alot whilst i am on call with someone, for example i had to leave a video call with my friends because it overheated to the point it was hard to hold. I am unsure if this is something to do with the weaker exynos processor but either way it was frustrating and has lead me to consider getting the One Plus 8 pro instead.",
            "I like the new samsung s20 plus, but few days into having the phone I'm having issues with the phone heating up at the back and the phone screen just going black. Apart from that love the camera quality, style and performance.",
            "nothing that I didn't already love about the s9. Its big an grey. Battery life still isn't good too",
            "love it all excepr Bixby.  Just don't want or need it.",

            "I've always been a fan of Samsung phones. My latest one was galaxy S8, after that I thought I would switch to iPhone to see which one I actually prefer, so after using iPhone X for about 6 months I've made a decision to switch back to Samsung. I love the camera features, design and just overall it's a great phone.",
            "absolutely brilliant phone. Brilliant for watching films,YouTube, netflix and the sound quality is really good. The camera is absolutely incredible and I'm still learning new things now. Plenty of space for saving photos and videos. I would happily recommend this phone for anyone after a good camera.",
            "Got this phone as I've had all the galaxy set from a 5. These phones raise the bar as to operating features but and this is a small but, I miss the little flashing notification light when you've missed a call/text/email",
            "I love this camera/phone,it has all I need.The photo and video quality is without equal,especially the video.The design is superb and looks really neat.I'm still discovering it's features and so far they are excellent.Performance has been what I expected,Brilliant.I am very Happy with my purchase of the S20 5G,it's by far the best camera/smartphone I've owned and would certainly recommend.",
            "taking away aux isnt great but phone is very quick and has loads of new and easier way of using a smartphone",
            "Great features, feels great to use, excellent display, really very pleased overall",
            "Very please with the phone to date. Battery seems to last longer than my old S9, which is very pleasing. Good phone. Very happy that I purchased this model.",
            "the speed and style, a fantastic phone does everything it says on the tin and. More,  photos are amazing, your best. Model yet",
            "screen is so clear and adapts automatically to lighting around you. For me playing Pokemon go it is a briiliant phone as screen is big enough without being too big.\nPictures taken with the s20 plus are so vibrant that i dont think i will change this mob when i need to..",
            "Cool features  great screen good camera needs to be linked to fitbit",
            "The phone is sleek and stylish.  It processes very quickly. And the camera is fantastic.",
            "Best phone I have every had, it is perfect in every way.\nBut it was super expensive I can't believe it.",
            "not to sure as yet still getting used to the fone and what it can do  ..  Saying that this is the 2nd one I have had as the first one set it up ooh brilliant  next day no WiFi kept dropping signal no 4g same kept dropping bring up pages  bouncing side to side videos continues to just buffer so got in touch Vodafone took approximately 10 /14 days to exchange  so first impressions not good Things are getting  better  so still getting  used to its functions and stuff I can do with it so give me a month..as it stands good .",
            "I was so excited about this phone but the camera takes ages to open up and I'm constantly missing the opportunity to take photos as the phone glitches and freezes all the time!!!! Phone also struggles to take photos close up and slow to take photos in general",

            "so I ordered five of theses for my company and it was mostly down to them having 5G and as my company is logistics company I wanted to make sure my drivers had entertainment why they where on breaks or sleeping away from home but from the company aspect of things its brilliant as im not able to use apps for real time monitoring of things making everything run just that bit more smoothly",
            "I used to be an iPhone user but swapped to a Samsung and it was the best choice I ever made. Absolutely brilliant.",
            "still i cannot use 5G but with 5G will be amazing phone. Last 6 years I using only galaxy phones. But every year giving better quicker phones. Cannot wait for next galaxy but i am in daily love with S20+. I cannot say any neagativ feature or fault or any missing thing. Thank You samsung. And i will buy the next galaxy definitely. Also still using S10+ for second phone so never run out with battery :)",
            "Freezes  intermittently and the WiFi switches off and will not switch on until you restart it. On the plus side the camera is good",

            "I love this phone a lot. The camera is amazing.\nI am just gutted I missed out on ear buds and a watch.",
            "I like the fact the phone isn't oversized as although its big it still meets the requirements to fit in a pocket it also has an insane camera aswell as other features that separate it from other phones in the market",
            "5G performance no difference to 4G except that it burns battery life.  Overall phone battery barely makes it through a normal working day on one charge.  Fingerprint sensor is incredibly difficult and I am nearly at the point of turning it off completely its so annoying.  No Sp02 sensor, which as an asthmatic was quite a useful feature.  Keyboard issue with full stop hit instead of space bar still a problem.  Most of my apps didn't port across in the smart setup meaning I've had to redownload them as I needed them, often at really inconvenient moments.  Phone signal also doesn't seem as strong or consistent on this handset, I've had several calls drop.",
            "As an iPhone user I first moved to s9 very sceptical and not 100% sure. But I love S20+5G! Size perfect, features are endless and I still need to exploit all the camera benefits but for an amateur like me it's great!",
            "I do love Samsung products as followed all the way up the s series but the s20 is a great phone but from jumping from my s9 do feel it's improved but not massively and wished that I waited. The camera is better and you can power share but beyond this don't see much difference battery lasts a little longer but not that much as I think because of screen size and quality of screen that the battery uses more and even tho I have loved Samsung I am now considering other brands as tried another brand on android which was a slightly older pro model feel it ran smoother and better battery so although a great phone wouldn't of upgraded for it if tried 1st or maybe gone for a new pro",
            "The Usual quality of a Samsung Galaxy. The Extra screen space gets absorbed in your memory but is still welcome. It has a very nice solid feel. Battery life is marginally better than the S10. \nThe big challenge - apart from the lockdown is that on O2 I've not yet seen a 5G Signal, in London or Manchester - and now lunatics are burning down the masts...",
            "wasted alot of money on a gimic the samsung s20 plus the zoom can bearly focus on objects  9ft away anything past this just blurs up \nThe detail on the picture is nothing to previous models my other phone is a note 10 plus and it beats this hands down \n\nBattery life terrible \nVolume on loud speakers rubbish\nPlease don't waste your money on this model it has to be the s20 ultra anything under this is just not worth it",
            "The refresh rate is great to see, love the display. I've been with Samsung for a while now and I just feel like it's not as good as it should be anymore. Those amazing features list seem to get smaller every year and I'm starting to worry that apple are providing more these days. The worst thing is the difference between how much better this s20+ could have been between mine and my American friends. The expectations I had for this phone that at other companies delivered on last year still hasn't been seen on the S devices.\nNo Full sreen display.\nBattery life which should be better isn't because of the Exynos chip. \nNo matt finish on glass.",
            "I've had Samsung Galaxy phones since the S3 and purchased the S20+ 5G as part of my contract renewal.\nMy overall impression is that the phone's okay but not much of an upgrade on my S9 and in some ways it's not as good.\nPros:\n- Nice screen\n- The S20+ size is about spot on\n- Seems well built\n- 120hz refresh rate is smooth\n\nCons:\n- The camera is poor: auto focus is all over the place, especially for close shots. Pro mode is a bit better but to be honest I expected more. Maybe a few software updates will fix it. As for picture quality my 5 year old Sony digital camera absolutely slaughters it as far as I'm concerned.\n- Smart Lock doesn't work: Smart lock on my S9 was hit and miss but in the main worked quite well, on the S20+ it's simply broken.\n- Google Chrome constantly freezes to such an extent it's useless. \n- Finger print sensor is nowhere near as good as it should be, which is a shame given how much I need to use it due to the problems with smart lock.\n\nTo be honest I'd have been better off keeping my S9 on a sim only deal until such time the S20+ gets its flaws sorted out, which hopefully can be done with future software updates.",

            "I feel the phone is just the same as my old s9 plus. Feels the same, nothing exciting, unless you take alot of pictures. Yes the camera is very good and works well and the phone is faster but you would expect that from a new phone! But is the camera really worth the price for the phone? I don't think it is. I thought the battery was really good at first but after the time I've had with it I've just found its around the same as my s9 plus, just charges faster! Overall I'm not very impressed with the s20 plus. The only good thing is the camera. Everything else to me is just the same but more expensive. Offering the Samsung ear buds with the phone would have made the price more bearable. But instead you get the same headphones as the s10. I have 5g aswell with my phone but no where has 5g. Im lucky if I get 4g at times, so in my eyes its selling something that's not provided, city centres might have it but how many people live and spend everyday in city centre? Not so many! So that's a waste aswell.  Not really impressed.",

The S20 is thinner than the S10.. the fingerprint function im not using tried it and its very hit and miss..",
            "keep getting a third party disturbance in my calls and strange noises like high pitched ones then call ends. Also signal on Internet keeps going off now and again too making phone run slow. Still impressed with the phone though very easy to use",
            "I like that the charging feature is much faster. Great design. Overall impressed with samsung as I've had the S7 and S9",
            "My phone is faster than some of the work PCs at my job.great stable connection in between my gadgets and the phone. Best camera front and rear fantastic video quality. Fast processor no freezing or dragging . I could go on and on but really best phone I ever had.",
            "Great quality mobile phone. Loads of features. Fantastic",
            "love it I always have the latest galaxy and this is the dogs b#@@ well done",
            "Find it a very good phone. Little expencive. But for what u get it is not bad at all. Not had any problems at all with this phone. :)",
            "Nice bigger screen loads more things on this phone",
            "fast,great camera, amazing display resolution,  solid build",
            "Great phone with amazing camera and sound.\nDisappointed with how the screen has scratched so easily. I haven't had this with previous models",
            "Overall, the phone is amazing. Has all the latest features you'd want accompanied by a great look and brilliant battery life. The only flaw with the phone is the microphone placement; located beside the charging point, I always find myself covering I with my finger as a result of how the phone is held .Which is disturbance on calls and a nuisance when recording videos etc. The cameras are brilliant too, however the advertisements are slightly misleading with the max zoom capabilities and resolution.",
            "The size is just right. The camera is brilliant. It has the added features which make it easy to use throughout. The battery lasts for ages",
            "camera is unbelievable shows amazing colours see pic attached.",
            "Great screen. Photos are awesome!! I'd maybe like a few more camera modes added. Overall it's a class phone.",
            "its a good phone but not as good as I expected it to be,its no faster than my old S9 when browsing the Internet or downloading things,also the battery life isn't any better either.On the plus side it has a good camera again not as good as I was expecting but better than the S9 and the screen quality is excellent when I'm watching sky go. Overall it gets a 3 out of 5 because after all the hype I was expecting something special so it kind of disappointed me.",
            "Well firstly the screen protector that comes with the phone is a much lesser quality than the old s10 \nIt chipped within a week whereas the old s10 lasted a year and a half before even scratching \nThe phone itself just feels like the old one with nothing really new about it",
            "I love the Samsung family. Have done since the S2 and I love this phone I love the way it sits in my hand. I love the camera . I love how responsive it is. But the speaker when on speaker phone is awful. People on the other end say it sounds like it's in a glass. Which is so disappointing.   Never had a problem like this on all my other Samsung phones.. Wish I had waited for the note 20.",
            "i have been a Samsung user since the S6 and u have never looked back. They quality of the phones have just improved year upon year. They have never failed to impress and the S20 Plus has risen the bar. The phone build quality is second to none and the operating system is easy to use. The camera is of the best quality and the streaming of videos offers the best quality and is on par if not better than my 4K tv. I love everything about this phone and would never stray away from Samsung.",
            "Good camera, better battery life.. The lack of the led notifications has put me off it. It's annoying not being able to look at phone and see if anything has come in. Why did you do this. I'll be getting rid as soon as I can",
            "the phone is not what it appears to be. Too much hype and not living up to expectation",
            "Excellent phone, coming from the note 10 plus these are basically identical.i have had no issues with my phone everything is silky smooth.",
            "The phone is overall a great one! The camera could do with some natural colours, but that’s just my opinion. My major issue would be is software support, I would appreciate if Samsung worked on the software support and pushed them out on the same day, if not at least give a minimum of 3 year coverage of major software updates. Apple cover atleast 5 years.",
            "camera, screen, performance, love the sleek design",
            "I have had many Samsung devices over the years  and I really didn't think that the S8 could of been beaten, well it has. This phone is so quick at everything, the camera is really sharp and the bigger screen is an added bonus, just some of the reasons I stick with Samsung. Can't recommend enough.",
            "I prefer my note 9 if I'm honest. There isnt much between them in performance other than cameras are better and you can charge other devices via S20+5G",
            "love the camera. Large screen easy to use all round excellent phone.",
            "When i calling someone takes 30 too 1 min sometimes i wish i never buy this phone",
            "Nearly went for the iPhone 11 Pro as have had 4 Samsung Galaxy phones now.  So glad I didn’t.  My wife now has the IPhone 11 and my S20+ knocks the spots off of it.\n\nLove the display.  Video calls are proper full screen using WhatsApp though Netflix is still not quite full screen.  Sound is great, processor is really fast and storage is far better.  I also got a great deal on the price.",
            "what can I say  I just love this phone. It was so easy to set up and use. By far the best one I have ever had. It did have a restart issue but that seems to have stopped following and update.",
            "Good size easy to use camera amazing very happy with it",
            "An all round beauty. \nGood points:\nBattery life!\nScreen \nCamera lenses \nSimple physical buttons\nCustomisation \nPower/Ram\nBad points:\nFingerprint sensor \n\nA great phone it has to be said. Taking pictures with this is lovely, the choice of lenses mean you can frame how you'd like. Finally a phone with a battery to get you through the day. The screen is lovely, you don't feel compromised watching videos on it. Unfortunately the Fingerprint sensor sometimes needs a few attempts or a change of finger, i tend to rely on face recognition more. One other minor negative is the way the phone is balanced. The phone is tall, so as your typing you need a finger high up the back to stop it tipping out of your hand. But i am very pleased with it.",
            "I have bought the new S20 plus and the phone is brilliant. Only one negative for , not easy to switch off or restart. On average I need 10 attempts to  restart or switch off .\nWhile on my old s10 was dead simple, you only need to push one button  on the s20 plus you need to push two buttons at the same time and  isn't easy, at least for me.",
            "great phone does what it says at speed awesome piece of engineering",
            "Had a lot of android phones and this one is so easy to use like all Samsung phones",
            "I like cameras and features on this phone and has good quality on camera when taking pictures and playing music",
            "phone is fantastic, improved on the S10 and great camera. The biggest let down on this phone is the sound quality, it's terrible. Very tinny, you would not want to listen to music without headphones. Even listening to videos on Facebook is annoying. The fingerprint never works either.",
            "my galaxy s20 plus is an amazing device I love it but I did have a few problems initially. The main issue was the camera app which used to freeze constantly, also sometimes wouldn't save a photo that I'd taken. But that problem was fixed with a software update and now seems to work fine. Only other problem was with my 256gb mem card that I'd used in my galaxy s9 plus successfully wouldn't be recognised in my s20 plus so had to put an old 64gb card from a previous phone in which works fine but obviously I've lost the memory capacity of the 256gb card. Other than that the phone in amazing. Thanks samsung your phones just keep getting better and better.",
            "Great phone at a great price. Battery life seems good I've found after reading other reviews that said it was poor.",
            "camera  amazing \nFast  working  \nEazy to work  only problem  is tha buttons are on right hand side   n am left handed",
            "1st thing is no buttons on the left side which is fantastic.Longer battery life.world class cameras.Screen is the best so far.Have had all the S range phones upto the S9+.Glad I waited for the S20 range as was going for the S10+ next. So I think 10/10 all around. Is justified",
            "it runs so smooth not had a problem yet loving it the only thing I don't like is the headphone port being the charger too so you can't charge while listening to music through headphones",
            "Nice phone to use. Screen excellent and camera is very good.",
            "Got the Galaxy S20+ on upgrade last month and it is an awesome phone. Lightning quick, beautiful screen and the best camera on any smartphone ever. Highly recommended!",
            "The device runs very smoothly, and it looks absolutely stunning. The camera is great too as long as it's not a close up.",
            "Battery-This is my bigger issue and concern. I am coming from an S10 and battery life was average. I always had to charge my phone before leaving work at 5pm. I use my phone a lot therefore I was getting 4-5 SOT. Was decent. I bought the S20+ because, bigger phone, bigger battery. I have to say that I am deeply disappointed. I still have to charge my phone before I leave work which is big blow for me. I recently switched to 60hz from 120hz. Battery life is the same. Literally no difference. I don't game a lot, I only use my phone for browsing and messaging with friends. No heavy gaming sessions, no all day video streaming, no music. Just chat and forums and that’s about it. Again, I cannot stress enough how terrible the battery life is. \n\nPerformance-Being in the UK means that I am on Exynos processor which again it is a blow. I don't game a lot but when I do, I play 10-15 minutes of Call of Duty and boy this phone gets hot. After 5-10 minutes of use I feel the phone heating so much that I need to stop. I feel that is going to explode. I don't get it. We pay the same price, even more if you convert. Why are we getting an inferior phone? Do we not matter to you? If the fruit would have come with and USB-C port phone I would have switched. I have been an Samsung user since the S7 Edge and had the S8, S9, S10 and now the S20+. I never felt so let down by a phone. It will probably be my last Samsung. Sorry but such a high price for what? Inferior chip and lame battery life. No thank you. \n\nOn the plus side, form factor is great, screen is gorgeous, quality build is good as well. I like how you moved the buttons and still miss the headphone jack (I can't use normal headphones due to the shape of my ears, and regular ones don't fit). Camera is good, I only point and shoot so I’m no expert and was satisfied by camera quality since the S9 so nothing to add here.\n\nIn conclusion, is the first Samsung phone that I can't recommend. And not only that, I even tell people to stay away from it. Utterly disappointed...",
            "I thought was voing to be a lot better from the advertising of this phone",
            "Great phone, upgraded from S9 and well pleased I did.  Especially enjoy the camera features, single take feature is fun and the zoom is ok to get closer and help identify birds in a tree.  Macro gives reasonable results.",
            "I love the whole package. Everything from the design to its performance,especially with hi speed WiFi,instantly loads from Internet,superb bit of kit.",
            "Is the best phone that I ever had .................:)",
            "Excellent phone although the placement of the camera can be very annoying when you live stream as its placed rite in the centre of the phone and youre thumb covers it when playing games. Charges super quick. Excellent phone performance and amazing graphics!!",
            "The phone does everything I need it to do perfectly so far.  My only critical comment would be the removal of the heart rate monitor.  I used to use this a lot as part of the S-Health app on my previous Samsungs.",
            "I went from an S9+ to the S20+.  Honestly thought that I wouldn't have seen the differences as much as I have.  Faster, and smoother, in use.  Difference in camera is noticeable, and whilst my S9+ was 2 years old, I cannot remember a battery that didn't need charging at least once during the day....until now!  Very impressed and very happy that for more years than I can remember,  I have stuck with Samsung.   In fact, have converted my mother and my mother-in-law to Samsung, and impressively also my wife who used to be an Apple fan, but now will never buy Apple again.",
            "my Samsung Galaxy S20+5G works well,takes great pictures and the colours are amazing.\nOverall I am well pleased with my phone and it is well wealth every penny I paid for it.",
            "Not really any improvement on the S9 or S10 apart from the camera. Not worth the additional money.",
            "its a great phone, good cameras, great performance, battery goes down a little quick",
            "Having upgrades from an S7 Edge, which I loved and had for 4 years, this phone is amazing and so fast. Granted a fair bit bigger which I'm getting used to and so slippery without a case, it is such a great sleek design. Not to mention the camera. Wow the quality.  My wife has the S10+ and its even better than that which was already amazing. Paired with my new Galaxy Watch, I'll be staying with the Samsung family for a long time to come.",
            "love the screen resolution the speed of the phone and quality    but I have found (and my partner) that we have to press the screen really hard in fact almost have to bang it to make it work at certain times  regardless how I set the sensitivity which is a shame  spoils a great phone",
            "Amazing Camera, never have any issues. It charges really fast and lasts all day :) s20+",
            "My phone is what you call innovation!! I absolutely love the feature where you can minimise the screen so that you hand can fit.\nThe cameras are state of the art.. I bought this phone so that I can use the cameras to take pics of products in my new small business. I would have bought the Ultra if I could afford it, as it is even more phenomenal!!\nKeep doing what you're doing Samsung, my dream is to one day have a Samsung home. With every single device Samsung!! I drool over the Samsung kitchen videos on YouTube :))",
            "Just an outstanding piece of tech as per usual from Samsung, not a single issue with the product. The Camera is outstanding and highly underrated by people. People trash Samsung as a brand so easy, however, this phone outshines all the competition this year. Price is not a factor, if you cannot afford flagship devices due to cost. Do not purchase them look at the mid-range or entry levels. \n\nBattery life gets better over time, my battery can last me 24 hours on general use, high usage around 12 hours, but its how heavily you use the phone.",
            "Love the features of the phone. Takes great photos and has a great battery life. Due to lockdown not been able to test 5G yet",
            "Excellent phone, love the ease of use and the camera is superb!!!",
            "I bought the case to make it work even better it’s been good so far",
            "Fab looking, incredible camera. Doesn't appear to pick up 5G despite me being smack in the middle of a 5G area (according to a map). Sound from the built in speaker is atrocious! I had better sound from phones three models ago. Definitely a step backwards. Other than that, I do really like it, works and looks great.",
            "The 4 camera lenses are very useful,  and the wide range of other functions and apps.  Charging up is very rapid,  and screen display excellent.",
            "Upgraded from S10 +,I have nothing negative about S20+ 5g.\nOn the pricing side is a bit costly.",
            "everything \nIts just a really powerful phone , whether business or personal \nIts everything I need",
            "easy set up and transfare of data from the s9.the photos are clear.",
            "S20+ is a great all rounder with excellent screen, battery life, camera, and super slick interface.  It is much larger than any phone I have owned previously, but feels much smaller than it is and feels thinner, lighter, and easier to use than I expected.\nI upgraded from an S7 and the difference is huge.  The fingerprint scanner works far better than I expected and the facial recognition generally unlocks the phone before I have a chance to use the fingerprint scanner.\nThe battery lasts easily a day and a half, charges very quickly even with standard fast charger, and I find I don't now have to either charge overnight or switch to maximum power saving mode in the afternoon to get through the day.\nOne of my main reasons for upgrading my phone was to have a better camera, although I have found that while the camera is very good it is probably not the feature that has impressed me most.",
            "the samsung s20 plus is a great phone \nIt would be nice if you got an adapter for the USB cable to 3.5 jack with the phone thats the only problem I have",
            "Really happy with this phone. Powerful, versatile and with almost every available for a phone. I would have given 5 stars if the fingerprint sensor was better. That's my only small gripe.",
            "Good phone all round, pretty resilient, something I have always found with Samsung phones which is great to see especially with a more expensive model like the S20 series.\n\nGood camera for photography and a chunky amount of battery life to boot.",
            "not worth the asking price for this phone especially with the exynos chip so wish had snapdragon chip 100% better as you tube has many comparison tests to prove it i don't get it a flagship phone getting substandard chip I'm thinking of selling mine already and getting new i phone when there new model is out this year...",
            "camera  Quality is really good\nGaming on this phone is much clearer",
            "It's clear and everyone should know that this phone is perfect from the design to the perfect clear sound and all the perfect photo filters",
            "Battery very poor, at first I charged my s20 + once per day, but after few months im charging it 2-4 times per day. On \"device care\" after charging it shows that phone battery should last about 15h... - If I do nothing... So when im using it im charging it a lot... Big minus for that. When I was buying this phone i was thinking to have it for few years atleast, but now i see that after few months i already want to change phone... \n\nFrom other side, camera is really good, best what I saw, but again, when im trying to take pic when its darker, camera quality drops a lot and pictures looks like a took picture with nokia 3310...  Focusing also have sometimes problems..\n\nNow after 120hz screen, i cant go back to normal refresh rate phones, it looks like that they have lag.. So 120hz is very nice feature, everything looks very smooth.\n\nAnd built quality... I see some space where is front camera and top phone frame, there is a lot of dust every few weeks, idk why they built this phone with such hole on there...\n\nWell, my verdict would be, that if I could I would buy other phone,  from other brand, but I had huaweii and those phones keeps lagging all the time, and Iphone is overpriced kids and \"rich\" people brand, so this brand might be not the best, but there is no better one... I will wait for some newer models, maybe they will have better battery and overall quality.",
            "So many things about this phone are great (battery, camera, less curves at the edge of the screen). However there are some things that are far worse - the in-display fingerprint sensor is useless and works 50/50 of the time. The proximity sensor, if there is one, doesn't work very well - unlocks in pockets, when in calls etc.  The edge detection is either too keen or doesnt work at all, especially with gestures turned on.  Finally, the exynos processor - all the reviews come from america where they get the snapdragon, so their battery and performance are so much better than what the exynos users get, so don't expect these to match what you see on the reviews.\n\nA good phone, but not class leading, like my old S9 was when that came out. Certainly not worth the huge bump in price.",
            "The camara is great, photos are professional like, the screen is very bright, i can know see the screen in bright sun light, the processor is very quick, design is elegant,  i would recommend this phone.",
            "easiest phone to transfer photos etc to this new phone light easy to use",
            "I've been with Samsung since the galaxy Samsung S5 then had the S6,8,10+ and I loved my S10+ but when I seen the spec of the S20 ULTRA I wanted one.\nUnfortunately I was very unimpressed with the ultra, the camera was awesome on paper but in reality the camera was woeful and unusable.\nIt wouldn't focus, images were very grainy either close up or far away.\nIt was also like holding a brick!\nSo I returned and instead ordered the S20+ which is now the middle phone in the series and I believe was supposed to be the top model before they rushed out through the ultra.\nI am now back to being a Samsung fan with the plus model.\n\nIt feels like an improved S10+ plus with an even smoother screen, super fast browsing, downloading and uploading is a breeze!!\nBattery lasts a full day.\n\nThe sound isn't quite as good as the previous model the S 10+ which makes me think they've cut corners with the speaker in this model, but some tweaking in the settings can get it sounding ALMOST as good as the S10+.\n\nI am very happy with the S20+ PLUS  it has restored my faith in Samsung phones and the ultra now distant memory.\n\nI don't think they'll be using that camera in the new galaxy Note and will instead use the camera front this model instead.\nIf you want a new galaxy then this is the one to go for :-)",
            "I have just upgraded from a Samsung galaxy S10 to the new Galaxy S20 plus and I have to say I wish I hadn't, the battery life is useless, the camera is different to understand, the phone is heavy",
            "The Camera quality is amazing, the screen is great. I have not had any issues with this phone since I got it and it runs a lot faster than my old S9.",
            "Phone is above and beyond my expectation. Thoroughly enjoy the picture/photo quality. Have had some great fun thus far!",
            "Very snappy and impressive so far. Everything you want in a modern phone. Loving the single take photo feature and the camera in general.",
            "Excellent build quality \nFantastic cameras\nUnbeatable screen\nGreat sound\nTop specs with super fast speeds\nBest phone so far\nOnly gripe is the price, but I suppose you only get what you pay for.",
            "Best Samsung I've had, love the cameras , can't wait for it to be 5g in my area",
            "the screen is great, sound good and works really well. As for the camera I really don't know how to explain how good it is whether its a case up shot or a video of a sports game the quality is always great and worth seeing over and over again. All in all a fantastic phone",
            "Easy to setup the device and was able to port my details from old phone to the new phone easily. It was hot during my initial setup time. Was worried whether any wrong choice. But since I got things setup from there all looks good.",
            "Great phone love it but get your phone case to protect the phone too xxx",
            "For the most part the phone has been good. I am disappointed by the battery life, and some drop in performance. \nI am particularly disappointed as this poor battery life and drop in performance can be avoided by providing the same processor throughout the world. The Snapdragon 865 is much better than we get in Europe. If they want to use an inferior processor in Europe, they should reduce the price of the phone.",

            "considering we pay more than the American counterpart this phone is awful and its made worse by Samsung clearly knowing this seeing as they even sent snapdragon versions to uk reviewers won't be coming back to samsung after this let alone the poor battery life ice had days where for no reasob at all ive had to charge the device twice and its been mostly in standby so not sure what is going on there\n\nAlso they chose the most bland colours ever for the phone this year and to top it off they give later buyers a smartwatch rather than the god awful sounding galaxy buds+ whose audio is one of the flattest iver ever heard",
            "I would like to start by saying I love the phone just a word of warning for the 120 hz refresh rate drains the battery visibly so I put it back to 60 hz which is a lot better on the battery",
            "Great phone. Easy to use. Awesome camera...........",

            "I am so disappointed with this phone. I found it lacking in speed, quality and features.\n\nI sold my One Plus 7 for this \"upgrade\" and is wasn't.\n\nHere are the problems. Bixby will annoy the heck out of you for 1, that is if you can get the phone to open. The face recognition is slow, I mean slow ! My one plus was virtually instant, the Samsung takes 3 seconds, that is if it actually knows who you are, sometimes it just refuses. Same with the finger print Sloowwww! Then every 3-5 sign ins, it insists on wanting your pass code. Very very annoying.\n\nCamera is slow as well, and over saturates the pictures with colour. It has big problems with photos where this is both light and dark parts at the same time, you can have the dark or the light, not both, again no issue on my One Plus 7.\n\nReception is poor, I can swap sim from the Samsung to the On Plus and see a 2 bar jump in signal. Places the one plus work, the Samsung will not.\n\nEven if you turn off the default part which uses TCPIP instead of phone signal, the issue remains. \n\nBrowsing the internet is also slow, wifi seems slow as well.\n\nOverall I will be looking to sell it at the first oppotunity.",

            "Great phone except the following 2 points\n1. Fingerprint sensor is awful, I have 5 of the same finger saved and still never unlocks. May be due to the Samsung factory screen protector still in place. \n2. More annoying. Its ability to remain connected to the Internet. Phone is connected to router but says no Internet available. 20 other streaming devices in the house including an s10 would suggest otherwise. A quick toggle of the Internet button and connects straight back on. I've updated phone & router. Forgot network, restarted everything etc etc. The only thing left is factory reset of phone.

            "I absolutely love this device, it was easy to set up with samsungs smart switch, the camera features are just mesmerising and i love the health features especially since i got a free smartwatch to go with it. However, one downfall was the weight of the phone i fear if i drop the device it may get severely damaged due to the weight involved.",

The volume when on full I still can't hear the person on other side. Maybe just a bad one i got but I wouldn't recommend.",
            "Phone is good but using a subpar SoC for Europe while America gets the Snapdragon isn't fair. Knowing the performance and battery life could be better when its the same phone is a let down, especially at this price point. If I didn't get the buds+ free and a decent deal on my old phone this would have been a terrible purchase.\n\nLove the screen and refresh rate.\nCameras are great but once again, they don't use the same sensors or image processing so your losing out again.",

            "The first thing you'll notice about this phone is its amazing display with the tiny camera punch out. The 120hz refresh rate makes using this phone a joy. The usability it phenomenal and relative easy to use. I have alternated between iPhone and Samsung for the last few years but my time with Samsungs has been definitely more enjoyable. Definitley recommend this phone to anyone in the market for a new phone. 5 stars.",

            "A very good phone for the price you pay.",
            "Brought this phone a few days ago and I was actually shocked at the quality of the camera. Incredible quality and zoom. I'm excited to travel more and capture quality moments and share! Furthermore, the smoothness is so enjoyable. I've even kept a lot of the default functions on because they feel so right.",
            "l like the phone over all. Battery charges like in an hour from 15%. Fast enough for me. Happy with photos. Headphone are not nice.",
            "I have had my S20+ for a few days and I am really disappointed with the audio quality of this phone, even when connected to my BOSE speaker via Bluetooth, the sound is awful. Music played using my old iPhone 7 sounds way better.",
            "The phone is amazing, however the sound quality is very very bad. I upgraded from the s9 plus and I can confidently say that it had better sound that this. I had to play around with the equaliser to fix the sound and it's still not that great. I hope a future update will fix this issue cause apart from that, the phone is amazing!",
            "This phone is seriously the best thing I have ever purchased. It really is as amazing as they say. The camera quality is something else and I recommend to anyone!! Thankyou so much.",
            "I upgraded to this as I needed a new phone and the smart watch  offerwas very attractive. I currently use the p30 pro.\n\nI literally set this up and called my network to return it as I couldn’t stand it.\n\nIt’s clunky and heavy, my p30 pro camera is better, my phone is faster and it looks better.\n\nThe camera on the back is huge and hideous, easily damaged as well unless you have some sort of military grade case, making it even more clunkier and heavier. \n\nAlso has no support for contactless pay with Monzo.\n\nProbably a great phone for those who only ever use Samsung.",
            "the zoom feature is fabuloius. \nMy first Samsung and very pleased with it",
            "This phone is unbeatable, the hardware this phone come with is amazing, am very excited to try out the Dex feature, the camera is amazing too of course",
            "I upgraded from an iPhone SE and love my S20+. The phone is feature rich, with a slick OS (OneUI 2) and a gorgeous screen. \n\nAfter experiencing 120Hz there's no way to go back, however it would be even better if samsung made it easy to switch between high resolution and high refresh rate quickly. This is because I would prefer to use the YouTube app at 1440p 60Hz as the frame cap on YouTube is 60fps, and I can notice the difference between 2K and FHD whilst watching media on my phone.\n\nThe camera is A Class and is a good rival for the iPhone 11 Pro and Google Pixel 4, outdoing them with it's 30x zoom. The phone is of a great build quality, feeling very comfortable in the hand with the slightly curved edges of the screen adding a premium look and feel without being as susceptible to accidental touches as, for example, the OnePlus 7 Pro with it's waterfall edges.\n\nI'm overall really pleased with my experience and enjoy the extra functionality Android 10 offers over iOS. The S20+ is incredibly fast and has a very serviceable battery life even at 120Hz. Worth the money.",
            "I upgraded from the s9+ and the camera on this one is just excellent but the whole phone is excellent",
            "Very good phone well designed. Upgraded from S8+ and different is huge. Specially camera.S20+ is perfect !!!",
            "Bought as a gift at the recipients request. They appear to be happy with it. Can't comment on any of the features, sorry.",
            "By far the best phone I have owned, and I've had loads, camera is outstanding, battery life is superb and I am a heavy user, can't fault it at all, and I got it the day thay had a £150 price drop which was nice.",
            "Great phone nice size it's quick sharp and a pleasure to use. I upgraded from a s8 plus  and glad i did well worth the money.",
            "I have had my s20+ 3 days now and upgraded from the s9+ I have always found the camera quality with Samsung exceptional, but the s20+ just takes it to a whole new level. I did do a lot of research before my purchase and I'm so glad I did, I have definitely made the right choice for me. I was going to go with the Ultra but decided against it when the only difference was the 100× zoom and the size. \n\nI am by no means a photographer, or claim to have ever been one, but with the quality of the camera on the s20+ I have managed to take some images that are out of this world, at least for my standard of photography anyway. But even if you're a professional photographer, I am pretty certain that for a smartphone you will not be disappointed with what this phone can do.\n\nI have always been a Samsung fan over apple, and I will always remain one because if its one thing Samsung do right, its phones. Everything I could ever need, right in my pocket. Well done Samsung, never fail to deliver. Hope this review helps somebody else make the right decision.",
            "I bought it when it was released..initially it kept restarting all the day suddenly even when I was on calls! Now both the screen and glass over rear camera are broken suddenly in spite it hadn't fall nor being exposed to any forceful action! Even the ear bud that I was so excited to use has a very poor voice quality during calls that I no longer using them.. Very sad with this purchase and this will be my LAST Samsung phone(given that I had Samsung phones for at least the last 8 years. But this phone really disappointed me especially with the fortune I paid for it I expected much better quality..",
            "I got offered to upgrade to the S20 from a galaxy 9  two weeks ago and I'm so glad I did. Before it arrived the main thing I was worried about was the size but no need it's fine even for smaller hands. All of the features are brilliant and the camera is just amazing I have new baby daughter so lots of pictures are being taken and the quality is great so happy I upgraded when I did.",
            "I bought this phone a month ago and I enjoyed  its features. Screen looks amazing. The camera is good but needs a little update on the software.",
            "Very impressed, the only negative thing that I notice and that heats up a little bit,not in games",
            "I upgraded from the S9+ and I am very pleased with this phone, it has great new features!",
            "Thought this size of phone would be really big for my hands (I have small hands) but this size phone is fantastic",
            "I bought the Samsung Galaxy S20+ two weeks ago, upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S9. I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this phone, taking into account camera quality vs. the Ultra, battery life, performance, and more, which are all important features for me. So far, I have been very impressed!\n\nFirstly, a lot of reviews on here are complaining about auto-focus issues, high battery-drain, especially relating to the UK model, as well as the fingerprint sensor being troublesome. I can honestly say I have hardly experienced any of these problems. \n\nI am a moderate to heavy user, checking social media regularly, using many apps, playing games, etc. and my battery life has been exceptional. It has lasted me 2 days easily, whereas my S9 was needing a top-up with the same usage by the end of the day at least, and in some cases even earlier. Granted, due to the lockdown measures, I have been on Wi-Fi the whole time and haven't been on a huge amount of walks or adventures, but even when using my phone for GPS during walks and runs and using mobile data, the battery drain has been minimal. There is also no 5G in my area, so have been on 4G. I expect 5G would drain the battery a bit more. \n\nThe camera is slick, responsive and takes great pictures. It is worth noting the 64MP mode is not the default option - this needs to be selected from the top of the camera menu, which was not immediately obvious. The images this camera produces are very crisp and clear, even in low-light. You really can keep pinching in to look at the detail! The default camera mode is also pretty good, but the images are not as crisp as it doesn't necessarily use the 64MP sensor. I chose this phone over the Ultra purely based on the 100x zoom on the Ultra looking like a bit of a gimmick, and it is fair to say the 30x zoom on the S20+ seems pretty unusable unless you have a super steady hand or a tripod. However, it is very impressive how far you can zoom, and I expect if you were photographing something far away, the drop in quality would not be that noticeable.\n\nThe display is incredible. I was very surprised with the 120Hz refresh rate - this makes the whole navigation and scrolling experience even better. It does drain the battery a bit quicker though. I really like how the display is flatter - the edges seem a lot sharper, and there have been fewer accidental touches when compared to the waterfall edges on the S9. I can also say the performance has been incredible!\n\nThere are only a few slightly negative comments I can make about this phone. The first is the fingerprint sensor. I read many reviews saying it was troublesome, and the first few days, I had no problems. However, after getting used to the phone now, I can say the phone unlocks about 70% of the time with the fingerprint (on the first attempt). Some of this is down to getting to know where to place your finger, as the S9 has a very clear, dedicated area for placing your finger, whereas it is hard to see where on the screen this is without the display helping point you in the right zone. I am sure this will improve with time, but was surprised how fiddly it was to setup well, considering the price. Also, I think it depends how well you program your fingerprint - make sure to roll your finger or thumb around to get the best out of it! The other slightly negative comment is regarding the proximity sensor. On the S9, this was a dedicated sensor, whereas on the S20+, it seems to be in the screen. There is a little blinking pixel near the top of the phone which scared me at first, but it turns out this is the proximity sensor! The reaction to light level for the S20+ is slower and less accurate than the S9, but I'm really clutching at straws here to find some negative comments.\n\nOverall, I am super happy with this phone, and got it at a great price with student discount and trading my S9 in. I hope this review helps you make your all important decision!",
            "brought the S20 a few days ago, and man what a device its big and powerful, cameras fantastic, prefer it over an iPhone any day.",

            "I bought the Samsung galaxy S20+5G on the 10th March 2020. Very good handset and all features are sharp and camera quality is exceptional. The only downside is the battery life. I have turned off all the important features and even made the screen dark mode and still battery drains quickly.",

            "The phone is great but i have a friend who has the Sanpdragon variant and after comparing the phones there is a big difference in the battery and the image processing. Having looked into this watching a number of review videos it feel that we in the UK get bad end of the stick and get a much inferior device. I saw my battery drop by 15% where the snapdrogron went down by 7% for the same activities. If you watch a number of videos you will see that there is a large of issues with the model we get in the UK",
            "lots to learn not as easy as other galaxy phones but  smart",
            "Always buy Samsung's but this is another level again",

Cameras are great, screen if vibrant & battery is good could be better.\n\nA few points for S30. Bigger battery. 5G support on standard model. Most up to date Bluetooth (5.1). Bottom speaker grill front facing (like the top). Camera hump to disappear. Bring back a completely metal phone.",

Could be doing with a highlight and shadow dedicated adjustment controls but other than that no other complaints.\nNot used the 5g as yet as it's not available in my area but I'm sure it will be very impressive.",

This issue was leaving me out of email and contacts at least 3~6 times per day.\nAfter moving to Samsung I found that these issues are not happening and glad of it!\nAfter using the phone for some days now, I find the built a little inferior to the chinese counterpart, I don't like the edges, as there is a gap between the display and the metal and dust from pockets is accumulating there.\nStill regarding overall body, I found that the top speaker gap is so small that is grabbing my hair as pulling it out. So, it hurts a bit. This should not happen.\nIt feels good in your hand and battery is mainly ok.\nI'm used to an infrared sensor, for face detection, and without it face unlock is very bad. Slow and at night doesn't work.\nSoftware wise, it's great, Microsoft integration is fabulous, Very good for work and excelent with Android Enterprise.\nRegarding Camera, I'm disappointed, as the Zoom quality is way worse than my chinese 3 camera 40Mpx device. The image is blured at max optical zoom.\nThe phone has a high price for the reasons mentioned above.",
            "It's an expensive phone but my goodness does it perform. I'm loving that so many of the android features like always on assistant and the gyro-wake that used to destroy the battery life just 2 generations ago on my S9 are now usable while still getting a full 24 hours out of my phone.",
            "Camera could be better. Fake 100x space zoom. Please stop using xynos chips and stay with snapdragon.",
            "Had this for a few days. What I find is that my hands go over onto the edge of the screen when I'm doing something and presses random things. The screen literally does go to the edge. Same with the keyboard. Can't get used to it yet",
            "my new phone keeps resetting all the time for some unknown reason",
            "Samsung decided to employ ultra-aggressive image processing on the S20 Plus camera. Even if you turn HDR, 'beauty mode' and other image enhancing features OFF, the pictures it creates are still awful. Sharpening and contrast are cranked up to the max and the saturation is turned up sky high. It's not that photos don't look natural, they look ridiculously fake even by the standards of Instagram. The final nail in the coffin for me though was the face smoothing. As I've said above, I turned 'beauty mode' and enhancers off - yet it completely blurs and smooths the skin/surface of whatever face it recognises, whether that's a person or even a pet. I've sent mine back to Samsung and returned to my S8+ that ironically has a vastly superior and sharper camera that captures far more detail and doesn't blur everything into oblivion.",
            "I traded my S10 for this and I would have to say for the first time I am yet to see any advantage. In the past each move I made from S5 - S7 - S10 has seen genuine improvements, So, was it worth the considerable portion of my pension to change? I think not at the moment. Sorry Samsung, but I will remain a devoted follower.",
            "I brought this phone two weeks before it comes out am so happy with it",
            "Got this phone few weeks ago and love the phone and its features",
            "I have had all the Samsung Galaxy S Series even numbers since the S2, and I won't buy anything else. \nThe only issue i have found however, it that it takes up to 8 hours to fully charge using the Samsung charger. This probably won't be an issue if you charge once through the night, but all the other Galaxy's I've had charges in about 2.5 hours.",
            "has great features the ones I've used anyway but I'm still getting to know the handset",
            "I took on an extra handset offer from my network provider and I am ABSOLUTELY delighted...",
            "looks great\nEasy to navigate and learn to use\nLots of features\nOnly slight negative is the front fingerprint scanner sensor... clunky",
            "the one thing that is annoying is that there is no flashing light if you miss a text or a WhatsApp for example. This means you have to continuously check your phone",
            "hi i got this phone a couple of weeks ago,  all good so far it'll take me some time to get used to it, how ever i was disappointed when I qot refused  the new Samsung ear buds",
            "The S20+ has excellent camera modes, with night photography noticeably better than last year's models. Connectivity is very fast on both WiFi and mobile data. My main complaint is the lack of headphone jack, which means the audio does not sync to videos due do Bluetooth and I end up carrying a separate device to listen to music on my headphones.",
            "Amazing quick and great camera experience.. It's great new features..",
            "I pre ordered the phone for release date and I haven't looked back. Its a fantastic phone and I love it! Didn't see the point of getting the ultra and it was also a lot extra per month. But very happy, battery life is great. Need to try the 120hz out soon.",
            "The phone is overall good except battery life I hope they will fix whit software update.",
            "got some great pics ,great for watching video music and football",
            "Had this phone for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it , I would say not a massive improvement over the s10 series but screen quality is amazing like the fact that the screen is not so curved and the cloud blue colour looks incredible , would i recommend this phone absolutely but i think it is a bit on the pricey side but that is a personal preference .",
            "front fingerprint scanner not so good compared to galaxy 9+  also why alter buttons from left to the right and on galaxy 9 + easyer to power off phone",
            "pre-orderd this s20 + like it alot  thanks Samsung",
            "I just got the galaxy S20 Plus one week ago .\nIt is a great phone , good performance , elegant design ,good screen and android 10 is making a great difference.\n But the sensitivity of the finger print scanner is not that good for a flagship phone   (compared to others !!!!!!), hope there would be an update to improve it more.\nThanks",
            "Coming from the note 9, I have to say I'm impressed with the overall size and weight of the phone. The display is impressive running at 120hz, the screen size itself is also impressive, making use of as much of the display as possible (minus the camera notch)\nBattery life and performance are brilliant with apps loading quickly without out issues and getting a full day charge with steady use. \nThe camera takes good photos, when when zoomed and in high/low light\nThe 5g performance I get from the handset Is also spot on.\nI can't really comment on new features as it doesn't seem to do much more than my note \n\nOverall I'm impressed with the phone. It has a good size and weight. And had a very clean design",
            "Best camera I have ever used and all the other functions seem to be much easier to use, I am still finding new things on my phone and I love it , thank you Samsung fir yet another brilliant Phone , gutted I never had the Ear Phone option as was so excited to get my phone early, that I didn't look at all the options available. \nOnce again Samsung you have exceeded my Expectations.",
            "I got the phone start of March and its improved from the S9+.",
            "phones grand use wise. Don't get me wrong it can take funny turns and freeze sometimes but besides that its fine. What annoyed me is that I put my phone in my pocket just after using a photo app. 5 mind later took it out and noticed the glass on the main camera was broken. I'd love to say yeah probably knocked it but I was sitting at a desk pretending to work. Bit annoying that now its going to cost to replace it",
            "i bought this phone before release date and had a while to play about eith it and over all not too bad but battery life is poor. Full charge lasts me 6 hours maximum.",
            "I've had this phone just a few weeks and I find it a bit glitchy whilst browsing the internet it freezes quite regularly meaning I have to leave the web completely then come back not a problem I have had with any of my past galaxy phones (s2,s4,s7 and s9)\nSo to say the least it's a \ndisappointing experience",
            "Received this 3 days ahead of launch (thanks EE, for the pre-order bonus there!), and it's unsurprisingly amazing. It took a bit of getting used to the fingerprint scanner being within the display, having become used to the S9+ being on the reverse side. The device downloads brilliantly fast on 5G, and runs apps as fast as can be. No delays when tabbing between apps either. Camera's zoom features are quite breathtaking by modern phone standards. And I love that you can actually feel the camera shutter mechanism operate very gently sometimes.",
            "had the phone two weeks, quite disappointed with the battery life",
            "I bought 2 weeks ago and the battery died quickly then my Samsung S8",
            "Great phone loving the camera I got this in blue and its so pretty",
            "Had this phone almost a fourtnight now and very good not to complicated to use not given the camera a good test yet but looking forward to seeing how good it is",
            "Had this for two weeks now. I think the main killer feature is the screen. Impressive colours nearly edge to edge and the amazing refresh rate. Just gorgeous. Also love they have reduced heavily the curved edge. Camera is ok. Not as good at Huawei but good enough. Also love the new one UI. This sasumng feels really grown up and in a good way.",
            "have had this 2 weeks. Ots no different to my D9 yet loads more expensive. I've not noticed anything different on the camera and I'm actually really disappointed.",
            "I bought this phone on March . Its very great . Thank you",
            "it has a defect in the screen by the front camera its making me not want it",
            "I upgraded and decided on the S20 plus rather than the ultra and I'm sure I made the right decision.  Superb bit of kit.  The camera is excellent and the last update has improved the extreme end of the settings.  The UI speed is just exceptional I love it",
            "the phone freezes up quite frequently ,uou have to wait for it yo re-boot itself.v-annoying",
            "Its not bad, but I'm highly disappointed with the camera and the battery. Between upgrading my S9 to the S20 I borrowed a friend's iPhone XR for a week and the battery was phenomenal- could be on it all day and get home to around 45% left, and the camera had an amazing portrait mode which both really impressed me. Excited by all the potential for the S20 camera I was disappointed to find that while the quality was high/good- it wouldn't focus well. I tried taking pictures of my dog, and it simply wouldn't take a picture of his face in focus?! I had to upload a screenshot of the image in my gallery as the file was originally too large to upload to here. The phone looks and feels the part, however just placing my keys on the screen ONCE has left small scratches on the glass (I thought they were supposed to be scratchproof)?! I've got to admit, I should've stayed with my S9 or (as it pains me to say) gone for the iPhone",
            "Samsung S29 plus 5G.\nDidn't transfer all apps and settings like on previous Samsung- only half are there... 5G drains battery so that full charge is barely a days use.  Much preferred my S9 overall so far.",
            "have the phone about 2 weeks screen amazing battery life 100% good no lake there. Camera is amazing, for the pris you should get at least a protector for the body",
            "I love everything about this phone. The camera is something special",
            "I have been a Samsung user since the Samsung galaxy S5. So the battery life of the s20+ is really bad. I am a power user and by mid day its on 40%. It keeps crashing and restarting. I have had my phone changed by EE and I am getting the same issue. I really hope Samsung do something about this.",
            "Bought this phone recently still learning about all its functions. Love the screen size great battery life .",
            "This is an excellent phone if you are upgrading from an older Galaxy phone, but from a NOTE 10 PLUS 5G it's simply not that much of an upgrade unless you love taking pictures",
            "I don't find it much of an upgrade to my s9 unfortunately",
            "I got my Samsung S20 plus 2 weeks ago,  its the best phone I have ever used.",
            "Everything as ripped as I would expect.\n\nMy only negative is the battery life. Not as promised or advertised (nor from all the so called reviewers who also said \"incredible battery life\"). Very ordinary battery life. One day if you are lucky.",
            "Three weeks in, very good indeed.  Camera brilliant",
            "Got everything you need, camera is just perfectly perfect! Does work much faster than s10. I though size of my phone may be problem but the way is shaped is just not! Ive got also iphone 11 pro, normally use two phones but this time wanted to see the difference and if could will get second samsung s20 in smaller version .",
            "although having issues with the dual sim, I am loving my new phone\nGreat screen and the camera is just amazing",
            "I've had every galaxy S phone, this by far is the top dog. A beautiful phone, perfect features, easy to use, just a delight. The only thing is it over heats, to the point it cant be held...I'm trying to sort with my SP,  they are saying its a repair but on a brand new phone i dont think so.",
            "Such a great phone. So many features to personalise it to what you need and want and I don't just mean looks wise. No cons found!",
            "I got my phone about 9 days ago but I have not had a chance to use all the features on it because of the lockdown we're all in but after this is over I'll give a proper review",
            "I previously owned a Samsung S8 and I'm very glad I've upgraded. The phone works very similar, but has far superior quality.",
            "I bought this mainly because the memory on my s7 was almost full and the battery did not last long enough.\nThe s20 is far superior and the camera is superb.\nTransfering apps and data is easy.\nThe personalisation takes longer.\nLove it.",
            "Very pleased with my phone so far, haven't been able to get out and about to really  test out the camera thanks to coronavirus.",
            "I love the phone and the screen. The battery line is terrible though. Down to 40 % in about 5 hours with normal use. This is with 120 htz refresh. I don't want to revert to 60.",
            "I have had this for a week or two and on the whole I'm happy. Good battery, screen and build quality.\nThere are however a few bugs, chrome seems to crash quite frequently and I hope this can be fixed. The other bug is that when I unplug my headphones, the whole phone freezes and then restarts, this doesn't happen every time. Maybe every 1 in 6 times. It has also happened when I've unplugged the charger so it could be a problem with the USB port.\nAnother issue is my voice on the phone being very quiet, people can't hear me. Once I press speaker on and then off its fine.\nWould I recommend? Yes when the problems are fixed but at the moment no.",
            "The phone is good... Very power hungry and the camera isn't all it was hyped up to be. Disappointed if I'm honest.",
            "I am really happy with this phone, it has a lot of great features and the camera is as good as it sounds, love it.",
            "Love the camera, and features, although it is heavier that my S8, i will get used to it.",
            "The speed of the phone while having other Apps running is one of the best out there. My friends that use Apple are hoping the Apple phone is as good or their coming over the light side.\nI hope samsung don't let this phone slow down in the next couple years.",
            "theres  nothing  much to say i stayed with samsung as long as  i remember   its the best company and produces all the best technology  samaung mobile phones are easy to use with fast performance  i love  my new  phone and  i will always stick with samsung  \nThank you to all samsung workers providing best phones ever",
            "always had a iPhone i wouldn't have any other phone than i got a Samsung galaxy s10 it was the best phone i ever had now i got the Samsung galaxy s20 plus .RIP TO my iPhone days i wouldn't have any iPhone again finished now only Samsung phones only freedom",
            "I prefer my s9 plus.  It cuts off all the time. pictures arent any better",
            "Great feel to the phone all apps work well and a noticeable improvement in the speed and camera performance. The battery life is very good as we are all isolated at the minute the phone is getting over worked. Would definitely recommend.",
            "From the moment I received this phone I am very impressed.",
            "I have been a big fan of Samsung, since my 1st one, the S3, and I am loving this one, especially the battery life.  Getting a good full day with it, where as my S9 I was charging 3 times a day (must have had a fault), love the camera too.  The only issue you I have, & it is a big one,is the fingerprint sensor, is complete rubbish.  I hardly ever works, this is an issue when you consider the money you are spending on a premium phone. I am not expecting to try 3 times or more for it to recognise my fingerprint.  Or in a lot of cases not at all.  The S10 had issues, so why Samsung have you not addressed this.  You should be able to access your phone via fingerprint straight away. Not after 3 or more attempts. Fix this immediatley.",
            "The S20+ does not have a headphone jack, which impacts audio quality. For example, the audio lags behind the video via Bluetooth speakers and headphones. Apart from this it is improved in many ways and am overall very happy with the phone. Some highlights include a less curved screen, faster fingerprint reader, higher screen refresh rates, and 5G. Recommend it.",
            "i wanted to give 5* as I am big samsung fan..Waited for S20 series and upgraded it for s7 edge. Everything is perfect but phone is freezing randomly and restarting at any moment. I have seen lots of post with same issue.Is this issue identified and will be resolved in next update?",
            "After having the phone for a week now. I'm loving it so far. So many great features that haven't mastered it all yet.  But incredibly easy to use, camera is amazing, and its brilliant for watching videos such as YouTube. I had an Samsung S9 before this phone.  But this is a major step up.",
            "I had a S9 edge and decided to wait for the S20+ instead of going for the Note 10 5G, so glad I did! The phone is epic, very fast a massive upgrade on the other 2 models. The screen is awesome and fare Superior in my opinion to the equivalent Apple phone. Very easy to navigate and the camera is another level. Will take me a while to discover all the new tech upgrade's but made up with the phone! Well done Samsung",
            "I have only had this phone a couple of days and am still learning how to use it, but so far absolutely LOVE it!!!\nI did essentially buy it for the camera as I love taking photos and videos, but have to say am really getting into the swing of things (I am a slow, techie learner of a certain age group:)\n\nBit pricey but I guess that's what you get for purchasing some gadget first off release.",
            "I bought my S20+ as a trade in with S8+ . Good performance, camera it is a masterpiece but really dissapointed by the battery, even after i stopped apps for running in background,lower the cpu to 70%, home screen to black colour it bearly last until 4-5 pm from 6 am . That is average use of internet and average talking on the phone.,but always have in mind to save the battery because at 4-5 pm i will be 10% battery. Huge minus for battery.",
            "As I did preorder so got this device on 10th before releasing date. \n\nTrade in with my previous S9+. Really great piece of technology. Very fast some new features. \n\nHappy with my choice.",
            "I am really pleased with this phone. Easy and fast.",
            "the screen, the camera, the feel, and the smoothness of the phone is remarkable",
            "so I got my new Samsung Galaxy S20+ delivered yesterday and have to say very impressed with the product. its fast as lightning, quick charge, battery lasts well and easy to use. the camera is amazing and picture quality is A+. I got turned from iPhone to android by Samsung a few years ago and each time I upgrade its been worth it. personally this is the best phone I've had.",
            "I received my galaxy s20+ yesterday  as a birthday present from my husband, comparing this with the s10+ that we part exchange its fantastic, I would definitely recommend this.",
            "I upgraded to the 20 plus from my previous S model S model and this is a fantastic bit of kit which fits in nicely with my Galaxy watch and my Q led TV",
            "I am a loyal Samsung user and I have to say this one is byvfar the easiest to set up. All my apps and data transferred seamlessly from my S9!",
            "Just got my s20 upgrading from an s9. What a difference. Seemless upgrade process, huge and glorious screen, what I've come to expect from Samsung. Only one really annoying issue. I'm not able to use the android 10 gesture controls whilst using a 3rd party launcher. I've been using evie launcher for years, couldn't part with it and using the old gestures on such a colossal phone is frustrating. I understand why you've done this samsung, but please fix it! That being said, solid upgrade.",
            "I was sceptical of buying this phone. However I am finding it easy to use and good battery life.",
            "I am happy.....thank you.....my english is not so good......but realy i am happy for my samsung phone.....",
            "It has just been 7 days and I'm loving this phone the camera quality is amazing and the screen is just right.",
            "Glad I picked this phone brilliant phone and very good camera",
            "My stepdaughter and I recently bought a Samsung A50 each. Her one gobbles the battery and runs out of power quickly, my one has volume issues. Even on speaker phone at the highest setting it is very quiet, my battery behaves normally. No phone cases available either, every shop I've been to is waiting for a delivery.",
            "I'm very happy with this .slim and nice in the hand",
            "I bought the new A50 and A70 Samsung phones and find them both great value with good features."
