Luckily for her she had a P20 so she had an upgrade without me realising.\nBut I will say it’s so much better than what she had. Phone is a little bigger, functionality is almost the same but more slick and the camera is outstanding.\nWell worth the money and I have a happy other half",

            "I outgrew my phone's 32Gb memory as I use a lot of apps.\nObviously I can't speak for long term reliability but the manufacturer is offering 2 year warranty and that's how long I expect my phones to last, so no unplanned replacement cost. The memory at 128Gb isn't even breaking a sweat. I use it all day every day and it's coping well. It's competing very well with my company phone, which is one of the flagship models from another manufacturer. Never bought from them before but would again.",

I thought that too, but for the cost of it, it’s an outstanding phone with a great camera, display and design. The keyboard is a bit fiddly but I think that’s just me switching from Apple to Android and needing to get use to it. All in all a great phone and I’d recommend to anyone looking",

            "Couldn't get hold of my preferred Sony so plumped for this one. It's user friendly enough and not dissimilar in many respects to my former Sony. There's no light though to indicate a notification at least I can't seem to see how to activate it if it's possible. The text notifications seem limited to the sounds from the phone itself but I have managed to use Zedge tones for the ring. Battery life is good and I managed to get a case for it no problem.",

My brand new Huawei P30 Lite boasts of 4GB RAM and a whooping 128GB ROM! You can see why l am so ecstatic over my new phone!\nApart from the above, this phone is relatively easy to use, hence I’d recommend it to all and sundry.",

            "Amazing zoom and display, great camera, all needed apps, long life battery. Overall very good phone for this price. Would absolutely recommend",

            "Good price for reliable phone.",
            "Perhaps the best time to write a review isn't after 30-days but at this point the phone justifies my reason for buying outright rather than going with my network who offered a Galaxy S10 lite which would have cost nearly 3 times as much and was spread over 3-years. By Selling the old (very badly damaged Galaxy S8) and claiming the cashback from Huawei it cost net around £160 which is a bargain",
            "Iam ôk with this phone",
            "Phone looks beautiful & easy to use, not bulky to handle. Has a lot of storage. You'll not need to break a bank to acquire one, very affordable. Only downside is battery life is poor. I'll not hesitate to recommend Huawei P30 lite to all my friends & family",

            "The phone is very user friendly and has a great camera.",

            "Great value for money.\nCameras really good. \nEasy to use. \nSome phones can be so expensive so would defiantly recommend if someone has 200 to spend on a phone and wants a phone worth having.",
            "Took me 10 minutes from ordering and paying to collecting.",
            "Argos gave me a quick service the phone itself is amazing not had a problem with it runs fast and charges fast would definitely recommend this phone to anyone",

            "What I like about my phone is the simplicity of using it. The camera is excellent. There is enough features on the phone that I don't use all of them. Massive amount of GB to store files, pictures etc",
            "I was surprised by using a Huawei after only using Samsung and honestly I am impressed with the phone quality, especially the camera it takes such wonderful photos, and the battery life is great too. Its at an amazing phone for the price point.",

            "Purchased as a replacement for an I-phone, this android phone is easy to use and set-up.\nIt integrates well with all the normal Google Apps, Photos - Drive etc and does 'what it says on the tin.\"\nYou will need to buy an additional memory card if you want to store data on the phone - and I installed a 64 GB card - (max 128)\nSo far very pleased with it....",
            "I really like my old iPhone but when I tried this Huawei phone I feel in love with it. Worth the price and it's just as good as iPhone.",
            "My G5 died so needed a replacement, for the price and features it's more than good enough for now. Good all-rounder for everyday use, can recommend with confidence.",
            "I was sick of a well known brands handsets slowing down after updates and new models due out. After sticking with them for years I thought about trying a different brand. Beleive me this Phone easily rivals an Iphone 8 which is considerably more to buy. The software is just as fast if not faster. And the camera is even better. Believe me this handset is ridicously good for the price! Wish i had bought it sooner",
            "Good phone for the price. Battery lasts 1 day with lots internet browsing",
            "I’ve always had an iPhone but noticed that the battery life is getting ridiculous. I researched phones and had a play before I committed to getting it. Unfortunately you lose your history- photos didn’t all go over. WhatsApp & Text history stays in the Cloud, I hated this. Argos refuse to allow you return the phone if the box has been opened. O2 and EE will allow a change of mind period of about 2 weeks but not Argos. I’ve now bought an iPhone 8 and my life is complete again.",
            "Pros: Fantastic camera, pretty powerful, nice screen\n\nCONS: Terrible battery life and very quiet for calls (loudspeaker, headphones and earpiece)\n\n\nSo its not that useful as an actual phone. Wouldn't buy again for the reasons stated, but the camera really is great",

Would be better if it had the fingerprint unlocking on the front of the screen too but it's probably just something I need to get used to.\nFab phone for the price. I am normally a Samsung user, but I couldn't justify spending so much on the galaxy range. However when comparing handsets this phone is lighter and cheaper in quality but I feel its still worth it!",
