I watch videos on it regularly and it works really well. Battery lasts for nearly three days and gets charged very quickly. I had to buy a 20 W charger as it came without one. I like face recognition more than finger print as finger print recognition didn't work sometimes. In overall it's a great phone, I think.",

However, I was recommended this iPhone from my wife and daughter who said I won’t be disappointed as things have changed with Apple and they are much better then they used to be.   So I purchased this phone and have to say, the battery is excellent, very impressive, the screen and sound are great as is the pure performance overall, very quick and responsive, the latest version of IOS allows for greater customisation and it all works well.\n\nVery pleased",

            "Great phone and easy to use.",
            "Didn’t think I could justify spending a lot on a new phone but I can now say after using it for a while it is worth paying for a phone that works first time every time.  Larger screen size makes it more useful, I reach for my phone rather than laptop or iPad.  I don’t make many calls but have spent a lot of time using the other features.  Would definitely recommend",

            "I do recommend buying this iPhone",
            "The phone overheated in the first week using only maps in -3 degree weather.\n\nThe OS is lacking simple things like setting individual volumes. I mean really? \n\nThe battery is poor no matter what you read elsewhere. \n\nThe signal was always terrible compared to my old cheap android. Never got more than 1 bar and calls crackled.\n\nSupport for apple is great, but ultimately they can't make the phone better. Mine was returned. \n\nNeed to spend MORE on a charger. £30+",
            "Easy to use soon got used to face recognition",
            "No complaints, was looking for a new phone that was fast, has a long battery life and a good camera.\nThis was exactly that!! It also looks very stylish and smart, a simple but classic design. \n\nWould recommend to a friend, it’s suitable for anyone! 5 stars.",

            "Excellent design, good size & a great phone for the price",
            "Best battery life of any iphone I have owned, very quick to use and sharp and clear screen. Only downside is it`s inclusion of a not so good music player, which is very tinny and scratchy sounding. I set the bass in settings and it made a slight difference, onus on slight. It is also rather heavy, most likely due to battery size, all in all a very good phone, if music isn`t be all and end all for you",
            "Nothing to say it’s an awesome iPhone",
            "Very pleased with my new phone and very well priced.",

            "Nice looking phone in red. Slightly bigger than my iPhone 6s but still small enough to fit comfortably in a pocket.  Face ID is a great feature apart from contactless shopping at the moment due to wearing a mask, so need to use passcode.",

            "The only negative I would say is that is doesn’t come with a charging plug only the usb cable which is a different connection to those of iPhone 6&7’s so we are going to have to purchase one separately as currently have 3 people in the house using 1 charger",
            "Does everything it says very clear camera I expected this quality for the price. Bought as a birthday gift for older teen great for apps, college and anything else needed. I’m happy with the purchase so much I bought another one.",

The screen is clear, camera is crisp, speed is fast, and reliability is second to none I've seen.\n\nHowever, iPhones are still plagued with battery issues and the inability to easily switch off wifi/bluetooth despite their arguments and reasons for it. That's my only gripe about an otherwise fine product.",

            "It's a phone with a very good camera but a phone nonetheless. A reasonable laptop gives better computing experience for much less money so why anyone needs such an expensive phone is beyond me. The screen size does not lend itself to watching films or TV or working and the keyboard is too small for speedy communication.\n\nMy daughter was delighted with this marketing gimmick so Christmas was a success, with only me left with the unpleasant taste for giving my money for a lifestyle product.",
            "I loved my iPhone XR .very well screen. Easy to access all my accounts using Face ID. The battery life is very good well recommended :-)I’m so happy on my iPhone now",

            "Bought for my daughter who thought she was getting an iPhone 8 this XR beats the price",
            "This device was bought whilst on offer which brought the price down to level where I would buy. The XR as expected is very good, super fast with a very good battery compared to older iPhones. The design and hand feel are good and whilst this is not a flag ship model it feels and looks premium. Overall very pleased and would recommend.",
            "The XR has longer battery life which is essential with all media and apps we all use nowadays it also features WiFi charging I bought a charger for £8 from Ebay which works fine and does away with the lightning lead . The Screen is a bit bigger and right to the edge of the Phone than my 6s . \nThe Camera has a brilliant portrait mode it easy for anyone to get great shots . All in all the best Iphobe I owned definitely recommend.",
            "I previously had an iPhone SE, which was great but getting a bit tired and it was time for an upgrade. The phone itself is great, quick, great camera and all the standard iPhone features. I was a bit worried about the lack of home button, but I never even noticed it’s absence. The Face ID is brilliant, so much easier than the thumb print or tapping in a code. My only criticism is the size, I’m a 6ft tall woman and I’ve got big hands but it’s still really sizeable and a bit clumsy.",

            "The phone is amazing",
            "It’s kinda groovy. Upgraded recently from a 5s so this took some getting used to at first but it didn’t take long at all and I’m very happy with it. Just a really nice phone. If you need to upgrade this is the best option because it’s relatively cheap by Apple’s standards and it’s very high quality, plus the battery life is just insane.",
            "This phone is fab and good value of money.",

The battery lasts all day, the camera is amazing and it has so many upgraded features that I think are amazing, 100% recommend to anyone",
            "It runs great, evrything is perfect",

It’s not the most expensive iPhone model out there - but trust me, it does almost everything those other phones do. And is priced much lower. This is all you will need (and more).",

            "Bought this as a present as I have had the same phone for over a year now with no problems. Nice size screen and all the features you would expect from an iPhone.

            "Bought this phone to replace a v old iPhone 5s. Everything about it is so much better. My main concern was battery life but this is excellent - it can cope with more than a full day of heavy use without charging.\nThe only negative to me is the handset size - a bit too big to fit comfortably in jeans pockets, although this would be the same for similarly spec handsets I’m sure. Would definitely recommend, although I’m already thinking of upgrading to an iPhone 11 Pro which is slightly smaller.",

            "Quality of this phone is excellent! Cannot fault ut",
            "Recently bought the new I phone XR. I must say I am impressed with substantial technological advances. It is a massive step up from my previous SE model. Although it took a couple days to get used to navigation and access is very easy. I went for the smaller screen size again due to the step up form the SE and still feel it is a little too large for simple single hand use. \nOn the expensive side but seems to be worth the investment so far.",

When I got home I put it on charge for a few hours, put the SIM card went through the set up procedure , connected it to my MAC computer and downloaded all my settings and everything worked on it first time absolutely brilliant. This iPhone is not cheap but it’s got to be one of the best phones you could purchase. Well done Apple and well done Argos.",

            "I used to have a Samsung s9 and hated it entirely, it was buggy and slow and nothing was optimised properly so I decided to return to iPhone after 2 years and it was an excellent decision. \nAt launch I heard concerns of the screen but I see no issue (and that’s compared to the only good thing of the Samsung phones which is the screen), it is fast, all the apps are optimised, and the battery life is leaps and bounds better than my last phones.\nAll in all, excellent purchase.",

            "Thanks great deals and great delivery",
            "Very nice phones and compact \nEasy to use",
            "By far the best battery I’ve had in an iPhone, I can go days without charging it. I like that the phone is a bit bigger and heavier than previous thinner iPhones, however I know that isn’t for everyone. I would definitely recommend!",
            "Phone is everything apple says it is fantastic battery and clear big screen",
            "The fact you can choose the colour of your phone is a bonus.  The larger screen is great as I am actually using my phone more than my  Ipad mini.  Battery life is excellent and the HD makes watching movies a lot more enjoyable.",
            "Absolutely in love with my IPhone XR especially the Face ID feature",
            "My iPhone 6 was fantastic for 3 years, only thing that let it down was it was only 16gb, upgraded to an XR very pricey but so worth it. Feels good in my hand ,clear bright screen, Face ID is quick, great battery life,feels like a quicker version of my iPhone 6, familiar but faster and better.",

            "Best phone that is out in the market",
            "I had an iphoneX but really didn't like it as the battery life was terrible and on occasions it froze. I decided to go for the Xr based on all the reviews. This is the best iphone that I have ever had - great battery life - excellent screen - good build quality and a decent size. The Xr is also much faster than the X and I think the screen is much clearer as well. All in all a great purchase and as Argos have a 12 month interest free offer this helped with the expensive purchase.",
            "Great phone glad I purchased through my Argos Card",

            "Treated myself to a upgrade; clarity of photos are wonderful and v easy to use; extremely simple and hassle-free transfer of data and apps from old i-phone and was up and running in 10 minutes. Not got all the bells and whistles of XS or XSmax, but sufficient for my needs as I don't need any more. Only niggle is need to use same port for both wired charging as wired head-set, although option is to go wire-free for either/both but you need to buy the wire-free element separately.",
            "Wow what a phone and a upgrade from my iPhone 7. Battery last all day from 5.30 am till about 9pm  at night",
            "moved from a iPhone SE to iPhone XR, the price was reasonable considering they have exponentially increased to ridiculous levels, however plus points runs faster (don’t they always) the new animoji & memoji features are good, camera is slightly improved but if you need better camera go for XS. Battery life is impressive I’m using a quarter what did previously so lasting long time. Love the wireless charging feature very easy to use. Not a fan the way you have to close the app it’s a bit fiddly",

            "I recommend to buy one of the best smart phone ever.",
            "After previously owning Samsung Android phones this for me is a significant improvement. The lack of bloatware is a major plus, as is the excellent battery life. Face ID works great and the camera is also excellent. Apple products are expensive, but considering the future updates that Apple will provide it is probably is a better buy than an Android device, which is only likely to be supported for three years. Would benefit from a notification light.",
            "Nice looking easy to use and better value than 02",
            "camera could be better compared to flagships",

            "I was concerned by the higher price that Apple charge for their phones, but it is totally worth it. I switched from Android, and the small yet very helpful features that iPhone gives you are just so appealing that I won't be going back. Additionally it works so well with the MacBook, for example easy sharing of wifi credentials. \nFinally, I was concerned by the size of the phone in my hand, but as its very curved at the corners, it doesn't dig in  like some other large phones",
            "Iphone is always my first option. Its easy to use and super fast. I really like the red color and i can enjoy the image quality and video.",

            "Knew what I was after so no surprises still iam delighted with my purchase",
            "Not as good as the iPhone XS Max in terms of battery which is surprising considering the screen size difference. But if this doesn't bother you don't spend an extra £300 on the XS as the XR is just as good.",
            "This is my 5th iPhone and they get better with each new edition and the iPhone XR is no exception,\nI especially like face recognition and Improved battery life.",

            "Unfortunately can't compare with non-Apple products, but so far this meets all expectations from Apple.\nChose Argos as was not able to get to an Apple store and had already tried the phone from a friend.\nArgos customer service good and no waiting in the store which was clean and welcoming (in the Ashford retail park)",

            "Lovely upgrade from my last phone. Battery life is absolutely superb, and the screen is great. I wondered how easy it would be to adapt to not having a home button, but the replacement gestures are very intuitive, and it didn’t take long to get the hang of it. Face ID works really well, though not so well lying down in bed at night—so I do miss fingerprint ID then, but that’s a small thing. The only thing I really, really miss is 3D Touch. Overall though, it’s a great phone. Recommended.",
            "iPhone XR looks good",

            "The phone had a defective screen, so unfortunately I had to return this. It's the last apple product I'll ever buy. Apple devices are not as well made as they use to be.",
            "worth the price, great apple product long lasting battery and better than expected display. really fast as expected and the red just looks amazing",
            "Great phone! I was a bit nervous ordering this over the iPhone XS but for the price and what the phone has it is a great purchase! Only negative would be the size of the handset as it is difficult to hold in one hand and reach across the screen, but apart from the I would highly recommend.",
            "My little boy was gobsmacked with his present apple iPhone Xr it does exactly what it says on the tin thank you Argos for the smile on my little boy’s face one truly satisfied customer",

            "Great iPhone for the price to from this the rest of the x series really don’t compare , camera is amazing however portrait mode a bit flat however, Face ID is suprising how good it is at recognising even in bad lighting . Colour is great and makes it stand out from the majority which is nice, if considering the x and can live without the dual camera this is the one to go for",
            "My son absolutely loves this phone, it can do no wrong!",
            "Great upgrade from an iPhone 6",
            "The price of the phone really worth it because of the lots of good features and beautiful design",
            "I bought this phone as I wanted to go back to apple after being an android user for many years, my sister recently bought an XR and I had heard no complaints from her so I went ahead and bought this phone. Firstly, the design is beautiful, I have the blue version and every time I turn my phone over, I just can’t help but admire the shade, the screen with a notch isn’t that big of a deal considering iOS implements the notch so well that it doesn’t make it too bad. Love it",
            "The phone has everything that I need to use it for",
            "Upgraded from IPhone 7 as wanted bigger screen. Tried android phones but went back to IPhone as found it simpler to use. Lovely phone, might be too bulky for some, but I don’t mind it. Chose white as thought it would go with anything and everything.",
            "After checking out the XS and XS Max decided on the XR. Next choice was colour, went for Red.\nGreat phone, nice size, and great screen. Very impressed with the battery life and speed. Highly recommended.",
            "Great value for money",
            "I am an Apple fan so when it was time to update my phone the XR made sense. It is priced below the XS but is packed with the same features and has the same A12 chip. It has a great screen size as there is no longer a home button to make room for. The new gestures used to replace the home button are intuitive and don’t take long to master. The camera takes great photos and videos (in 4K). There are cheaper imitations out there but apple win hands down on quality and a slick operating system.",
            "It’s really excellent good phone",
            "Excellent phone do like apple and the wife is very pleased with it as it is slightly bigger than the other one she had battery life is very good so overall very pleased.",

It's excellent biggest screen really close to the edge no big borders around the phone easy to use software is so much better than my last apple. So yes I would get this phone I would recommend it to a friend and I would  Argos service all the way through was very good no problems in stock good value for money",
            "This phone is stunning and the battery last ages its quick to charge aswell i love the colour it was my first choice , i would recommend this highly its the best iphone i have had to date",

            "It’s a very nice phone, it’s fast and the battery is amazing!!!",
            "Upgraded from iPhone 6 as it was very slow. This one is much faster, battery life is 1.5 day, good camera and bigger screen. Like it, but a bit pricey.",
            "I think it’s worth the amount paid.Features help in no doubt loss of data, if stolen or lost.",
            "Good price \nNeeds more stock, difficult for me to get",
            "Phone works great and it was really easy to order and collect",
            "It’s a great phone in all aspects, had my last iPhone for four years and didn’t think I needed another one until I dropped it and ran over it in my car.\nTotally amazing,updated apps for face recognition so no more sweaty thumb issues!\nArgos service amazing as usual with quick click and collect!",
            "Great phone. Upgraded from 6s so all the new camera features are appreciated",
            "My teenage daughter loves her new phone, it does everything a teenager wants.  It gives and asks for nothing in return!",

            "Love the new phone and its features, great prize too",
            "I upgraded from an iPhone 7 to the XR and am not disappointed! The battery life lasts me all day (and then some) without the need to charge in between and Face ID is a welcome addition - especially as my fingers seem to hate fingerprint readers of any kind! The camera is pretty special and the portrait mode is a nice feature. Would recommend to anybody.",
            "I love this phone I was worried about not having a home button but not missing it one bit. \nNice large screen super fast system so what else can I say oh yes and a super long lasting battery!!\nIf you are on the fence about this model get off and buy it \nYou will love it. \nPs my old phone was a iPhone 6",
            "Top tec without so much as a button \nMy daughter loves it!",
            "Great phone super photos and really fast on the net",

            "This phone is great.\nPreviously had an iPhone X which had major issues,\nThis is much better and great value.",
            "Another fantastic apple release, this model is great as it’s size sits between the Xs and Xs Max has almost all of the same features but is priced much lower. The red product is normally a special edition but is available as standard for the Xr. Brought for my wife as a present and she loves it having replaced her Iphone 7 it feels like a big upgrade. Highly recommend if you’re looking to upgrade your older iPhone or move over from android :)",
            "This phone is a fantastic upgrade from a 6s plus. just got to get use to the fact it has no home button and therefore the functionality around that is slightly different. There is however so much information on this via google that it doesn't matter and you'll soon get used to it. The battery life is far better too to the point it will last at least 3 days if just used as a phone and around a day if doing moderate gaming. I would recommend this if upgrading form a 7 or below for sure.",
            "Bought this as a Xmas present for my daughter, she absolutely loves it, especiallly the camera quality.",

            "I thought long and hard about upgrading to XR from iPhone 8. Many because of the Face ID and size of the phone. I like my phone to be pocketable and XR just fits into jacket pocket still. Face ID is surprisingly accurate and don’t miss the fingerprint. The battery so far lasts about 2 day dependent on what use it for.  I tend to use 2 fingers to text due size.  You definitely need a cover for this phone as it’s so smooth.",
            "Good phone for its price",

            "Five stars would recommend to everyone",

            "I can't complain so far I'm pleased or I comment too early",
            "What can I say, I downgraded to this from the XS Max. This has 95% of the features of the Max and in an easier sized product with an assortment of colours. It's the best iPhone I've owned.",
            "This phone has a much longer battery life and a much clearer and detailed display! However was difficult to get used to after owning the 8 as the X has no Home button! Overall once you get used to it the phone is amazing!",
            "I'm really happy with this purchase and recommend this phone over the iPhone XS. it is significantly cheaper and has a better battery life. you don't notice any difference in this phone and the iPhone XS other than this being slightly bigger, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion.",

            "Bought this as an upgrade from an iPhone 6 and the difference is amazing. The screen is far bigger and looks amazing, the phone overall is much faster and the battery life is a huge improvement. The phone is obviously much larger and therefore heavier but it doesn't take long to get used to it. Very impressed.",
            "Great camera on the iPhone xr",
            "Nice phone with latest version and large screen",
            "For once a good value product from Apple",
            "All the benefits of an iPhone X but at a reduced price \nThe main difference between the XR and the XS  is the screen but to be truthful. It’s a great screen and looks excellent",

            "One of the most ingenious products in the market.",
            "I’ve fitted otterbox case & glass screen protector expensive (so is this phone) \nDon’t understand people buying cheap covers",
            "Pros: -bigger screen\n-Quick\n\nCons: -missing Touch ID \n-missing %battery symbol on screen without sliding down to another screen\n\nThe phone takes a few days to get used too if your used too the older iPhones.",
            "Fantastic iPhone definitely worth the upgrade if your coming from an older iPhone. \n\nBattery is fantastic last all day and Face ID really good. Just he right size screen too would highly recommend !",
