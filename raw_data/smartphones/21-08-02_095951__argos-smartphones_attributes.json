            "This was bought to replace an LG which lasted for years this Sony Xperia L4 most definitely didn't disappoint battery lasts for about five days without recharge (after initial 12 hours which all Android have) it has a brilliant camera and photos can be edited.

            "The price was considerable and good for the product u get. I'm normally happy with Sony products because they are normally really good but cheap at the same time. One thing to maybe note is that if you don't like phones that have a shorter width then u probably wouldn't like this one because it has a short width. But overall km happy with the product.",

            "I always used to buy the top tier Sony mobiles on contract, this phone is a good replacement for my ageing Sony Xperia xz premium. Phones do not last forever, no point I realise now buying flagship phones when a phones only as good as the non removable battery in it. Now I bought this outright and for the price it's simply the best on the market, accepted planned obselecance buying cheaper throwaways is how it is now. A new battery cost more than my old phone was worth so I bought this!",

            "The phone is exactly how you'd expect a flagship Xperia to work, its quick and I.dont find the screen that dull considering the bad reviews its had about brightness. There was no issue collecting from store.",
            "needed a upgrade as my trusty XA2 was on its way out, good looking phone well packed with the apps and specs needed, got used to the additional length this phone provides quickly and still fits in jeans pocket.",
            "Had to wait for stock to come in Sony L4's seem to be popular. The phones as I expected well made a reasonable size and price. I'm hoping it will provide good service as previous Sony phones have.",
            "Great value, great upgrade from my L3, and able to pick up the next day covid safe!",
            "Once you get over the gaudiness of the screen size it's actually a very good phone, you might have a couple issues with resolutions and full screens on some websites but mostly a good match for just about anyone.\nWhile the screen is large the bezel is very small so it works out to be of a comfortable size",
            "Really pleased, looks nice and is easy to use.",
            "A good phone not the fastest one about but if you want a good smartphone without paying £1000+ then you won't be disappointed",
            "For some reason the fingerprint doesn't work also there isn't even a setting for this ?",

            "Got this new mobile for my wife she not too impressed unfortunately as it's very smooth on the back so it's a bit slippy and easy to drop and we had fantastic home WiFi and everything in the house connect's but this phone is not great always losing connection so not too great wouldn't buy again may have to return",
            "I purchased this phone as my Sony phone was getting a bit old. I found it easy to set up, transferring content from old phone to new was easy. Easy to use and battery life is better than my older phone. Would recommend.",

            "Is good phone where you can’t go wrong in terms of accessibility and having photo it does what exactly what it said.",
            "Bought this for my young daughter as her first phone as I did not want to break the bank on other more expensive phones and it’s perfect with a great battery, large screen and looks amazing. My daughter loves it as it’s just the same as more expensive phones and with the offer Argos you could not go wrong.",

            "Excellent service at the store and item was in excellent condition.",
            "It's ok for basic features little slow when moving",
            "Bought this phone to replace a Samsung Galaxy which had given up the ghost. Phone offered same specs as a more expensive Samsung so It was a simple choice. Easy to set up and use (even for a 75 year old!!). Only problem I find, and I suppose it is the same with most new phones, I don't seem to be able to get rid of all the annoying news articles etc which keep popping up. However, it is a good phone which works very well.",
            "Does everything and I love it",

            "This is my second Sony smart phone. The last one lasted six years. Built to last great phones",
            "buy it is good price and good quality",
            "Great budget phone, does everything I need and more, built in mirror cast makes casting easier than other popular brands, battery is long lasting even with apps running in the background. Screen is large enough for watching videos or playing games and the phone is just the right size for holding in my hand and fits easily into my pocket.",
            "Can't really go wrong with Sony.",
            "great phone for the price does everything i need it for",
            "replaces an older Sony Xperia Z4 and this is even better. Easy to setup with good audio and camera.",
            "I have been using Sony for the past six years but this one is not the best. I have Sony L4 phone for less than three months, plug it to charge, when I took it off the charger I realized the phone is bend. I contacted Sony but they asked me to pay for the repair costs which is not my fault. So disappointed and am not using Sony anyone.",
            "Performance is not bad considering the price. Screen is a little narrow, hence keyboard keys are too close. Not too heavy. It won't connect to my car via Bluetooth, which is very annoying, otherwise happy with it.",
            "Really good quality for a good price!!",
            "Brilliant mobile for the money can't fault it",

            "Well worth the money. Solid Phone and does the job as well as any premium phone.",
            "This new phone is an updated version of my Sony Xperia and it looks great. Also the storage is plentiful and photos look really crisp.",
            "From ordering online to picking up from store - hassle free, excellent customer service.\nExcellent phone, far better and has more features that i first thought. the split screen is awesome!",
            "The model is perfect to me. Great camera and battery.",
            "it is too soon to soon to find all the does and dont's",

            "Brilliant phone well worth the money",
            "The phone is reliable and is responsive, basically a solid smart phone for a reasnoble price. Runs all my apps.",
            "Good smart phone available from stock and at a competitive price.",
            "I purchased this handset for my son and have been very impressed with the performance. It has handled apps and streaming as well as high end handsets at four times the price. The handset is comfortable to hold and the screen is great for streaming. Would definitely recommend.",
            "The phone is fantastic. Great camera highly recommend",
            "Got 2 of these phones now for my kids. Great phone just as good as the premium brands out there but a lot cheaper.",
            "This is an inexpensive phone, a little bit large for cargo pockets on work trousers, but overall seems a decent phone and good value.",
            "Good product like the phone slim and good",
            "This was fairly easy to set us from old experia. My old phone was dying.  This has pretty decent battery life and all seems good so far. Good price too considering what I paid for my old one.",
            "Have always used Sony products and needed to upgrade my M4 Aqua mobile due to lack of memory capacity. \n\nVery easy to set up and use, this is a very good mobile phone and the system does not 'eat up' all the memory. Very sharp screen as you would expect for Sony.\n\nOnly downside, but not a major problem, the battery life could be a bit better. All in all a very good buy and excellent, speedy process buying via Argos.",
            "I bought this Sony phone as a upgrade to my old iPhone but was very disappointed with it as it had a faulty so I decided to keep my old phone and sent it back to argos and got a full refund",
            "Well worth buying 64G for extra storage.",
            "I would definitely recommend this phone",
            "Similar to my previous two Sony phones. Don't like the position of the on/off and volume buttons on the side. Should be higher so as not to interfere when holding",
            "Not happy as you are advertising them as dual SIM, but I discovered after purchasing it t that it's is in fact single SIM,",
            "Love it does everything I need it to",

            "Great phone slim design fits in my hand, I really like Sony phones had the Experia 1 over 3 years ,only problem I had was ,it wouldn't down load apps ,took it back to factory settings ,working perfectly, really like it , definitely recommend,",
            "I needed a new phone quickly and chose this on the basis I very much liked my previous Sony phone.  This phone builds on what I liked and has some new software features that are good as well and its easy to find your way around.  When you first see it it seems quite big, but its easy to handle and you very soon get used to it.  Would recommend. Argos service first rate as usual.",
            "Easy to use and good value.",
            "Great phone for price, Sony are never a let down for me. Great storage, camera and easy to use.",
            "Low cost price phone with good quality. Some phones out there are so expensive and have less features than this phone. I recommend if you've a low budget but want a decent phone. I do think one improvement could be the internal storage, but I was able to get a MicroSD card for this and still not have to pay even half the price of most of the phones out there currently. Camera quality I wouldn't say is as good as other phones currently but isn't significantly terrible considering the price.",
            "Would recommend excellent quality one of the best phones iv had",
            "Excellent phone, nice sleek design and very responsive. Phone cases are hard to find but I managed to get one from an online shopping site. A must have phone on a budget..",

            "greatest ,,,,,,,,,,,,",
            "Bought to replace an ageing Asus Zenfone running Android 4. Didn't want anything too fancy just a basic Smart Phone which would run all available apps quickly and efficiently. This fits the bill. The battery life is especially good, as is the 21:9 screen. Purchased the (in my view) much nicer blue model.",
            "Depends on what you want out of a mobile. The camera isn't bad but If you are looking for a top spec camera then look elsewhere. As I use a good compact camera I'm not really bothered. This phone however still features the little old style multi coloured notification light which is invaluable when I'm at work . Sadly a lot of manufactures are omitting this feature. Its a slim tall phone and looks more expensive than it is esp. the blue one",
            "Very surprised with this phone a lot better than the dearer ones",
            "Very good quality, easy to use, only downsize is no backing case_very slippy",

            "I have always liked Sony mobiles and this one has lived up to expectations. Fits well in the hand, and does everything I need to very high standard",
            "This is a great phone. Easy to use",
            "Great product, but Argos only stock the single sim xq-ad51, not the dual sim xa-ad52 described.",
            "Love this easy to use and perfect for me",
            "Makes my iPad safer to use",
            "Great phone great value for money",
            "I bought it to replace my previous Sony phone which stopped working.   It is very easy to operate even though it  does much more.   It is light to hold and clear to see. I am pleased I chose the blue colour, very nice.",
            "I like the phone its a good phone good camera for taking pictures",
            "Excellent battery life, about a week.  Love the storage, much better than my old phone.  Argos service secure and easy to collect from Store.  A local phone shop were most unhelpful so would recommend Argos first!",

            "This was and upgrade to my time served Sony Xperia M2, owned for around six years. Still working quite adequately truth be told. The L4 was relatively easy to fire up and set up. The big disappointment has been the carrier signal. My area is dogged with poor signal (Virgin mobile customer) and the L4 is struggling more than the M2 was. It can only be down to the set's antenna. All in all a capable mobile but feels like a little step backwards.",
            "Needed a replacement quickly, transfer of data and settings easy and slick Xperia to Xperia",
            "Sony xperia is a really good phone. I had Z2 witch worked great for 4 years and now I'm glad to replace it with a new model at an excelent price",
            "Always buy Sony Xperia but not too impressed with this latest purchase",
            "Like being able to use the larger font so I don't have to take my glasses everytime to read it",
            "Sleek slim design, works perfectly",
            "I brought the phone for my son it is a lovely slim design and many great features. Would recommended this phone",
