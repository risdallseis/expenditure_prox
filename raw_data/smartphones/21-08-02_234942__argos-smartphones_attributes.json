I wouldn't say she took to it like a duck to water but she managed to remember how to use it the day after I showed her. It is a really basic phone and I didn't go into things like photos or text messages. She can make and receive phone calls so I'd definitely recommend this for technophobes.",

However I was disappointed that the volume is not as loud as my old one, the font size is smaller, and I find the white on black text difficult to read. The torch which was the deciding factor is likewise disappointing.",

He needed to communicate with family and this basic mobile phone has enabled us to talk to him. Simple to use answer with the green button end with the red. Incredibly simple to program in numbers and a very easy to see screen. Battery life is outstanding over a week. There is even a camera too, basic but does the job. Highly recommend this basic phone.",

Can insert a micro SD card in order to save and export photos. Battery charge life is excellent.\n(The phone gets a 'Which' best buy rating).",

Attempting to access the internet on my mother's old phone was a massive waste of time; not worth the bother. Smart phones I found much more intuitive.  Which is bizarre, given the intended market.  However, I found this phone much improved over past models, it feels much more streamlined.  It has brilliant short cut keys. The internet is ignored; not a bad move.",

She is able to push the buttons but I had to purchase a non slip case to stop it from slipping through her tiny hands. All ok now. Simple phone to use and does the job",
            "Bought for my 90 year old mother.  Have programmed my number into button 0 so that she can just press that without doing anything else to contact me. Just needs to keep it charged. There is an emergency button on the back which can be set up to text five people in turn until one replies.  Size of the text on the screen can be set to large so it’s easy to read. Functions easy to navigate and use.   Have set volume to highest but mum still has difficulty hearing when using it.",

On a separate note, I ordered a SIM card to come with the phone, but it never arrived, so had to get another SIM car from the Supermarket.",
            "Very disappointing. It takes at least 6 keystrokes to call anyone in the phone book. Yes there is quick dial but this requires a long depression of the right key. My 91 year old mother in law struggles with this and if she ever presses the wrong key she’s lost.\nWhat really old people need is a phone that is switched on with one key depression and ring somebody with the next. They don’t want Texts, alarms, torches, radios, cameras etc.",

            "A usefully designed basic mobile phone, ideal for my elderly father.\nWe like the balance of screen size, number/key pad and the extra features such as the shortcut keys. The menu navigation can be a little frustrating, but in time with practice it will be fine. The speaker and ringer volumes are good, but not especially loud, so someone really hard of hearing may struggle.\nSeems to hold its charge well and is quick to charge.",

She is able to navigate the names button to find her contacts. The arrows on the front can be used for navigating or turning the volume up or down. It's a nice size too. Well done Doro!!",
            "The Doro 1370 is a basic, simple to use phone, just for calls & texts. Good for older people who don't want to get involved with a smartphone! It doesn't seem to last for ever (my husband has had three in two years), but at least it's cheap to replace and you just put your SIM card in & it's ready to go.",

Also like the larger keys and screen compared to the old mobile. The phone has a camera. Bought a micro SD card for storage.\nOne minor disappointment is that the user guide says the phone can be connected to my computer using the USB socket, but I cannot find a socket on the phone.

The design of the phone and it's features are the best out there, the screen is perfect too. The only downside is here seems to be software issues. Things like switching itself of when sending a text. This phone has great potential however the software needs looking at by the manufacturer, and I'm sure it's not just me, in fact m sure.",

Good sound, clear display, easy to set up and use, nice big buttons.  Perfect for my requirements.",
            "This is as good a basic phone as I can find - very few others seem to have contrasting numbers and background. \nIt is a great shame that a charging cradle seems not to be available even from the manufacturer. \nThe phone seems intended for simplicity of use but the only means of charging is a rather fiddly plug in cable rather than a much simpler to use cradle.\nA potentially great product spoilt.",
