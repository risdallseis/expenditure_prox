Given the chip inside will get updates \nfor years to come. Battery life not amazing but very fast charging to makes up for it. To be honest miss the smaller phones. This one is so nice to hold in comparison to mine.",
            "I had iPhone 6 before this phone for 5 years. I loved it. The only problem was small memory and was making phone slow. This phone it’s very similar to previous just more memory and faster with more programs but looks exactly like iPhone 6. I love my phone!",

            "Works as expected. I thought the battery life would be better but it lasts all day so maybe I am expecting too much. Nice feature now that did not happen on my last phone, ok it was old, was the transfer of data between the two. Saves lots of time and simple enough for me to do successfully.",
            "I knew exactly what I wanted as had the same phone but an older version, for me possibly the simplest IPhone I've ever used. Was a little disappointed they have changed the size meaning I had to buy a new phone case. But for a new person to iPhones a great way to start. Argos's same day delivery was excellent especially during the lockdown & reasonably priced",
            "Excellent phone for its price",
            "It is a defect piece. The other person can’t hear the voice. Very low and sometimes they can’t hear anything. So I have returned it within 2 days",
            "Excellent service and phone",
            "With all the features of the iPhone 11 but at half the cost it's a no brainer. Yes it looks the same as an iPhone 6s but olon the inside it has the chip set and features you need . Brought 8 so far for company phones",

            "Needed a phone quickly and could pick up on the same day from argos, does the job perfect",
            "This iPhone was recommended to me by my nephew as an upgrade from an old iPhone 5c. For an iPhone, it is excellent value and being someone who is not brilliant with technology I love the fact that he has a front button so that I can use Siri to make phone calls very easily. All I have to say is phone Mr XXXX on mobile on speaker and it will connect.  It also allows me to make phone calls on my iPad via the phone.",
            "Fab value for money, so much cheaper than the other iPhone models, but still with a fantastic camera. Personally, I also prefer the smaller size of this model in comparison with the newer, bigger models as it makes it easier to hold.",
            "Loved my 1st gen iphone se which I had for over 3 years and this is a brilliant replacement. About the size of an iphone 12 mini and looks really smart......especially in red. Does more than I actually need and, at 64gb, is twice the storage of my old phone. Really pleased that I made the choice to buy another se and would highly recommend it to anyone!!!",
            "Made the payment for'click and collect'  and picked up the phone in half an hour.\nUnfortunately, about the Iphone, I never saw in my life to buy a brand new phone, spend around £400 and the phone has NO CHARGER, NO EARPHONES.  I understand not having earphones, but to sell a phone without charger, in NONSENSE. Looks like Apple is the Great :))",
            "Bought for the wife. She seems happy with it. Seems to have a more up to date processor etc. \n\nI personally would not buy a phone manufactured by a company who admitted to slowing down phones intentionally but that just my stance. I would never recommend an apple product as I personally feel it you get better value for money with an android handset.",
            "Easy to transfer from iPhone to iPhone. Better price then newer iPhone models and does everything you need it to.",
            "Bestseller and good Product I got same phone for my son last year and it’s very very good and I bought same for me few weeks ago",
            "Easy to fit in pocket and use one hand for browsing. I recommended.",

            "The phone is great . Just not had my nectar points added like it said I would",
            "Great phone never liked iPhones always I had Samsung’s and this is the first iPhone I have rated would recommend going for this iPhone",
            "Usual quality from an apple product, slightly bigger than the old one, looks smart",
            "This appears to be a very good replacement for my old iphone . Does everything I need it to do.",
            "Phone is fab and does all I need. Doesn’t come with a charger plug and the charging cable is now different to every other USB device in most households! Apparently this is quite common now so don’t forget to buy a charger that accepts the new charger cable when you buy your phone!",
            "Great price and fast collection in store wife loves it as it’s new chip makes it a lot quicker and seamless browsing compared to the iPhone 6s would recommend and nice size to fit in your pocket",
            "My partner loves his new phone. East to setup and use.",
            "I moved up from an iphone 6 to this iphone se - iphone 6 was on its last legs (had it from new).\nI didn't want one of the bigger iphones because of arthritis in my hands.\nThis iphone fits the bill. Improved screen quality, clear sound, camera does everything I want it to do.\nTransfering everything to the new phone was a doddle using itunes.\n\nGood all round.",
            "My old iPhone 6s had served me well, but I fancied a change. I didn’t feel I needed the big screen of the iPhone 11 or 12 as I have an iPad Pro and this phone had everything I needed. The portrait mode is great. I would definitely recommend this phone.",

            "Staff was friendly and very helpful",
            "Just what I needed. Had all the features I required, recharged quickly and charge held all day, plenty for my use. Good price, and fits easily into a pocket . Recommend if you just need a small hand held phone that is recommended on many comparison sites",
            "This phone does everything I need from a phone and looks good too",
            "Fantastic phone, smaller size which suits.",
            "I was very happy with the product but I wasn’t happy with the amount of time I had to wait for a VAT receipt if you could speed that up in the future would be appreciated thanks",
            "Great phone bought this as a replacement for my young brother in law who’s iPhone 6 was beginning to show the test of time with freezing. He is so far loving it and that’s always good for a quite household! 10/10",

            "Great phone , quite expensive but I phones are.\nIf you want a really good phone then buy this.\nThere are a lot more expensive I phones out \nthere, but I doubt if they would do a lot better\nthan this.\nThe camera takes excellent photos as well.",
            "Top notch phone from Apple.\nHandy size , not to big.\nAll the tech you need in one place.\nVery Happy with purchase.",
            "Ordered and collected in store straight away. Great phone as expected just what I wanted to replace old iPhone, simple set up, would definitely recommend.",
            "I needed a replacement for my previous device, given that I a company device I did not require anything overly technical.  The device itself has a good size and weight and has impressive battery life. Screen controls and sharpness etc are exactly what I expect even from the lower range Apple device. For the cost and may purposes this is a great purchase",
            "Got this iphone for my wife- excellent purchase. Big upgrade on her previous phone.",
            "The quality of it it’s fantastic, I really like using it and I enjoy. Way better than my previous mobile and it’s easy and quick to set up and understand.",

            "Not the first iPhone I have purchased, but the keyboard is so much easier to use on this model. Nice size and easy to use and read.",
            "I love the colour and the sleek design allows you to fit it into pockets!",
            "As I tend to use my phone more as a phone than anything else then the smaller screen of the SE didn't put me off at all. Indeed, the smaller form factor of the phone makes for a much more hand and pocket friendly bit of kit. Since it has pretty much all the inner working of the iPhone 11 it's fast and up to date. And at £300 less than the 12 mini it's a winner in my book.",
            "Good camera quality and great value",
            "Was purchased purely to be used as a video camera and compared to professional 4K dedicated cameras, is an absolute steal. I use it with FiLMiC PRO software which allows me to create hiigh-quality content without the high-quality budget. \n\nAlthough it’s not used as a phone I am an iPhone user and can say this would also be a fantastic cheap smartphone option.if you are not in need of the latest super-powerful hotness.",
            "Quick and easy to purchase\nSo quick to set up \nA bit pricey but need it fast as smashed screen in old phone",
            "Purchased the iPhone SE to replace my iPhone 8. Perfect for me as I don’t like the larger iPhones & my daughter uses the SE for work.\nCollected quickly & entirely safely so very happy.",
            "Great phone for its size. Really comfy to hold and use. Only downside is silent switch rattles. Camera good quality for normal lighting.",
            "Having owned apple phones since the start this one is the best its fast and compact. Don't be fooled by the term budget phone.For Apple yes it maybe classed as a budget phone in comparison to the latest 12 mini that is but it still rocks and is well worth the £ The camera works well whilst I use multiple applications for work and you get the added bonus of having the selfie mode, good for those close up shots where you want the depth of field to blur the background.",
            "A fantastic phone easy to use and excellent for transferring all data from old phone to it",
            "Not got it yet as it’s for my birthday March 1st but I think it will be good and I have pals who have iPhones who think they are the best",
            "The only issue with this phone is that it comes with a lightening charging cable but no plug. It’s not your normal usb connection either so you can’t use an existing plug. It’s something to be aware of if you don’t have a spare charging cable at home.",
            "Great item, Wife is more that happy with gift, easy to get on Argos web site click and collect, phone was ready to be picked up with in minutes, Very easy system to use.",

            "I bought this to my boyfriend and he is happy",
            "Easy to set up and use very impressed by camera",
            "I am more of a fan of Android phones than I am of iPhones but I kinda needed one for work as most of our systems are Apple oriented and I didn't want to be lugging around an iPad the whole time.\n\nYou are probably not going to get all the bells and whistles with the iPhone SE as you are with the other model that came out last year but it does an equally as good a job but at half the price, if not more, of any other brand new iPhone.",
            "I like how we can order now and just collect in store. It save a lot of time and effort’s.",
            "This phone is so real and it’s so kind of you guys to get it straight from apple store and it has 1 year guarantee which is so amazing!",

            "It’s a nice phone & small for me to hold",
            "Good phone, little pricey but worth the money",
            "The phone is good for the price \n\nNice size \nSmart looking\nFunctions well\n\nCamera isn't amazing but good.\n\nDon't get a plug for charger or headphones with it which is disappointing",

            "The iPhone SE 2020 is exactly what I needed.\n\nIt doesn’t go in the same direction as other comparable price phones (most notably running Android), which often use one gimmick to attract customers (an amazing camera, in-screen fingerprint reader OR a very long battery life), but are very otherwise bad to mediocre in the other aspects.\n\nInstead, Apple decided to come up with a phone that works straight out of the box, and offers good quality for its money, in all its aspects.",
            "Love my Apple phone lovely to handle wish got one long time ago",
            "I cannot stand the increasingly larger and larger phones that seem to be the only things the Android brigade are peddling at the moment. And yes, this latest iteration of the long standing iphone SE has a slightly larger screen than the original model- but like I always say, \"never mind the size, feel the quality\". If I had the foresight to have bought a larger memory iphone SE and not the now paltry 16GB model, I would not have upgraded at all. But this is the least worst option.",
            "Super easy to set up and transfer data from previous phone, good size - not too big and not too small .",
            "The iPhone is very good and easy to use but the charger doesn’t come with the iPhone",

            "An affordable up to date phone great features sleek and robust excellent speed",
            "After research I opted for my an Iphone SE 2020,replacing an old phone. Easily ordered online & collected by a family member from the local Argos store the following evening. Good price (compared with other suppliers) and perfect for my needs. Could have gone for a new package with my service supplier, but by buying the phone outright and transferring my sim card, this method was simple and marginally cheaper overall. I'm in my late 70's and found the whole experience relatively simple.",
            "Great iPhone for its price. One of the more affordable models and it’s just an all round decent phone",
            "Bought this for my daughter ,she is really impressed with it .If my teenager is impressed with it must be good .I know how fussy teenagers are these days .Would recommend.",
            "I dithered about upgrading from my old 5s, even though the battery was coughing up blood. This is the first iPhone that I've bought  brand new. The transfer of data was painless, and only had problems with two app which was largely my own fault. I'm getting two days use before recharge, with lots of apps, light use, and low power Bluetooth for Covid app. I begrudged having to pay £9 for a lightning to headphone lead but otherwise happy. NOTE. It’s not dual sim as advertised.",
            "We recently bought two Apple iPhones se, and we are both quite happy with them, (not high users). easy transfer of our data from our old iPhones.",
            "Dropped previous phone down the toilet and needed new 1, seen this iPhone se(2020) for little money, ordered at 9.30 and was ready to collect instantly, highly delighted. Usual high standard from Argos!",
            "For anyone wanting a smaller phone this iPhone is great. Had no problems at all. Even my daughter is amazed by it and she has the new 12.",
            "Phone is full of apps and is very fast,",
            "Iphone SE is fantastic - very much plug and play worked quickly once data, etc had transferred from old phone to new one.\n\nGreat service from Argos.",
            "The iPhone SE was a phone I’ve been wanting for a while now. Buying it from Argos was quick and easy! Was the perfect Christmas present to myself!",
            "More than happy, so easy to change from one phone to another. Excellent service from Argos.",
            "Dropped calla frequently I used it for 4 days and had to give up as it dropped calls frequently and had quite poor call quality. \nNoticeably the battery life is terrible, my old phone lasts well over a day, nearly 2, the way that I use it; but using SE the same amount or less the iPhone SE was flat in less than a working day.",
            "This product A13bionic chip as in the iPhone 11 is the fastest for a phone like that it’s 4K camera quality is the best",

            "Bought at local Argos, easy collection. \nProblem with phone as SIM card holder cracked. Poor design as very thin. Phone replaced with no quibble\nThank you",
            "A great value iPhone. Stunning in red.  Well pleased so much better than my old Samsung.",
            "Does the job and looks like an iPhone 7",
            "same spec as the new iphone 12 apart from the camera. very fast, just half the price",
            "I bought this phone for my husband as his old iPhone 6s wasn’t keeping its charge & he’s very happy with it.",
            "Seems to fit the bill of an excellent and efficient phone",

            "Excellent phone. My daughter loves it. Does everything you need, at a fraction of the cost of a iPhone 12",

            "Have been look to buy a new sim free phone for Christmas 2020! My old phone was 5years old and so good due to lockdown was worn down by my teenage son! So I’m overall very happy would definitely recommend this phone",
            "This phone is great. The quality of the screen, and especially the camera and the sound of the speakers are just amazing. However, the battery doesn’t last long and the phone doesn’t come with a charger, which is nonsense. Also, it is difficult to hold the phone as it’s really slippery. Without a case, you’ll definitely let it fall down at some point. But in general it’s an awesome device. I would definitely recommend it.",
            "Good product, easy to use and just the right size.",
            "Better price excellent phone",

            "Brilliant !!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "Decided to upgrade to the new SE and not disappointed. Easy transition as very similar if not identical functionality to my old 6S but much faster, better camera and with hugely improved battery life. Has all the functionality but at a great price.",
            "My last phone sound/microphone had died. So this was nigh on a strap swap. Very happy with this new phone and the sound is superb. Easy to use and clearer pictures. Recommended phone.",

            "I’m very happy with everything was fantastic",
            "It was a pristine unboxing with a very good delivery service which gave it a certain touch to the purchase.\nPerfect",
            "Very good phone , amazing powerful processor and great battery back up. Only draw back is they should have provided a plug in charger socket.",
            "The honest good price paid at Argos for a competing Apple  iPhone device. It should be said loudly.",
            "Worth every penny and Apple do not fail to please with this iPhone SE 2020. Best features include a decent camera, finger print recognition and all the usual excellent iphone features! A handy pocket sized, slim phone that looks and feels great !",

            "What can you say... it's an iPhone... and it's Red....Beautiful !!",
            "The iPhone SE retains the old big bezel design, but is still an excellent smart phone and a genuine bargain at under £400. The screen is sharp and the camera is very good, but without the wide angle found on the new iPhone 12. Having the home button has actually been very handy when wearing a face mask vs trying to get Face ID or PIN codes to work. The iPhone SE is super fast and will continue to receive updates for years to come. If it only still had a headphone jack it would be perfect.",
            "This iPhone is one of the best battery life is the best and the camera is really good for taking photos. I am really glad i purchased this iPhone instead of the more expensive iPhones this is just as good.",

            "My iPhone is great no problem",
            "Good all rounder, was bought for my 13 year old step daughter as her first brand new phone. \nDidn’t know the lightning cable had changed and no plug comes with the new ones now so that will teach me to read the descriptions. Could have been made clearer in the buying title hence four stars",
            "It’s Apple so you know you’ve bought a good product, my mum is very happy with it",
            "Really easy to use and swapping info from old iPhone to new one was completed in 15mins. Definitely recommend.",
            "This phone replaces an earlier model of the same. The features are great and just what I need. Great phone; slightly bigger than last one which takes some getting used to, but otherwise all good.",
            "Good for the money my partner likes it and is alot better than his old phone. Works fast and has plenty of storage",
            "Within technology there are so many different options, but I think I phone is so easy to use, it’s easy to setup all pretty straight forward. This specific iPhone is just like the 11 but smaller, not a phone of huge phone and so this one is more compact but also a better price. This was definitely a great purchase!!",

            "Very easy to use and good quality product",
            "It’s a phone. It does the text messages. It does the voice calls. It does the emails. It probably does more. It’s got the interweb.",
            "Lucky model!! I highly recommend it to all!!!",
            "Could have been better display on advertisement that you will need to buy a new plug to charge it as you dont get one and the fitting is no longer a usb plug like older iphones",
            "Great product from Argos but not happy that apple don’t use u s b attachment and you have to buy a fast charger off them because it’s not supplied with the phone",

            "The picture of the SE on website shows the newer version of the phone without the plug but I’ve received the older version with plug and headphones.\nIn general a very good phone.",
            "Great iPhone for much less than the standard models",
            "The iPhone SE was made with the iPhone 11 specs inside with one camera instead of the iPhone 11 dual camera system\n\nBrilliant iPhone with a processing speed which is more than enough for a Teenager always recommend iPhones anyway as I dont get on with android",

            "My new IPhone SE 2020 is an incredible addition to the iPhone family, it’s small, light weight and has a fantastic battery life! I would most defiantly recommend this phone to anyone, as this phone may be an SE but it is mighty indeed!",
            "Great apple product very happy",
            "I didn't want a large phone and the size of this is good. It has all the functionality that I need  and charges from the wifi pad and quickly. However there is no USB cable with it for charging. My only real criticism is that the battery doesn't last as long as I had expected - its not bad but I had thought that more progress would have been made here. The phone replaces an Apple 7 in which the battery failed me so it is a bit of a sensitive issue for me.",

            "I love iPhone products so far, but this iPhone feels like it’s been dropped. It doesn’t have the same feel as other iPhones I have used. Has a slight creaking noise when I press certain buttons, the home key feel like it doesn’t press down properly. But all in all a good phone.",
            "A good value phone, with most of the bells and whistles of higher models. Great shade of red. Really happy with the purchase .",
            "Great phone, this one bought as a birthday present- recipient delighted",
            "Great phone and the battery seems to last a while but that could be because it’s still new. Very similar in size and workings to my old iPhone 7 apart from the camera is a lot better. Overall happy with my purchase",
            "Great phone for the price. No complaints.",
            "It's a gorgeous red colour, it's an iPhone, & for a teenage grand-daughter anything else is a compromise too far!

            "I am pleased from the purchase.Good price, quality item.",

The phone feels lovely, great quality photos and fantastic software some might say it’s an iPhone 11 in a different coat, well worth the money. Ideal for older user or teenager or actually anyone who wants a decent phone for great value",

            "Chose this when my i-Phone 7 died. It's great. Very similar to use but more up-to-date, still small and lightweight compared to other models. I can't fault it - it really is a mini-computer in your hand, ready to go at the touch of your fingertip and the battery lasts quite a while although I'm not a heavy user. This is my go-to gadget for getting on the net when I want to quickly check my bank balance, browse E-Bay or Amazon or dash off a quick text or email without getting my Chromebook out.",

            "Excellent phone Dave me going to the Apple shop so easy at Argos",
            "We bought this as a previous iPhone 6 had died suddenly. The good news is that it is very similar to use, and it was easy to transfer the data and apps from the old iPhone. It is also compatible with our iPads and Macs.\n\nHowever, it is expensive compared with the competition and experience with previous iPhones suggests that the price does not guarantee better reliability. Battery life is no better than older iPhones. It needs charging daily and we are not heavy users.",
            "It is a great phone really pleased that I purchased it",
            "very easy to set up and use. Like the inphone instructions for use. Much easier than reading a separate manual.",
            "the phone is worth the price! the quality and feel of the phone is great.",
            "An excellent upgrade from my iPhone 6s. Same size, a little thicker, slightly heavier and a much better camera (although the old one was very good too) all in all a fantastic iPhone at a fantastic price.",
            "I brought this to replace my 2016 SE phone and it’s everything I need. It’s so much quicker than my old phone and was really easy to set up even for me and I’m rubbish at technology!",
            "Very happy with the phone. It has great features",

            "Brought this as a gift for my wife, she needed a neW phone but didn’t like the ones with the face reader to unlock due to wearing masks it doesn’t work that well. This phone has the latest specs and also has a fingerprint reader and a good price in comparison to the other new iPhone models. Wife absolutely loves it and was very impressed with the storage and speed of use. She had an iPhone 6 before and is over the moon that she can keep using her old case as well.",
            "iPhone SE is a good phone and was a replacement for my iPhone 7. The additional features are not very noticeable and the battery life is very similar. I’ve got double the memory but that wasn’t a problem with my old device. The processor is supposed to be faster but I’ve not noticed it. I’m hoping to make use of wireless charging as I’ve managed to break the charging ports on my last two phones (I changed them but it’s a tricky procedure). I didn’t want a large screen phone and this is adequate.",
            "Brilliant piece of kit so simple to use but a classic. And the product red just finishes off ! Money well spent .",
            "Bought for our grandsons 18th birthday he is over the moon with it",
            "Really nice phone, very smart and affordable. Great Camera",

            "For the price I paid it is the best phone I have ever bought. The battery life is brilliant and well it is so much quicker than my old phone.",
            "I’ve just moved from an iPhone 5 to a new SE and it’s marvellous. Size is slightly larger but slimmer. The good thing is that it is still as convenient to carry. All the functions are the same but better plus I still have a button to press so I feel in control.",
            "I was using iPhone 8 and never liked 11 or XR but this phone is amazing with all the best features.. I would definitely recommend this..",
            "The new iPhone SE is a brilliant addition to the iPhone range. If your after a slightly smaller version than the norm but with the same computing power this is the phone for you. It is easy to set up looks good and is easy to use whether you are new to iPhone or just wanting to upgrade without blowing the bank account. Highly recommended .",
            "This is my first experience of a new iPhone, so I'm impressed by reaction speed mainly.  Brilliant camera that records in 4k. An introduction into the apple ecosystem at this price point is fantastic. Highly recommend.",

            "My daughter loves it! She's happy, I am happy. This is all that matters!",
            "As you would expect from Apple - a great product. Built like a brick outhouse and should stand up to the rigours of daily life. Small enough to fit in a trouser pocket so very convenient. Poor battery life though",
            "I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is quite happy with it. Is more faster than the Iphone 8 that he had and the apps work much better.",
            "Bought as a gift for my granddaughter.\nShe is delighted with it, great features at a reasonable price for an iPhone.",

            "I've just taken the leap and moved to Apple from a Samsung Note. Iphone 11: It's not an Android phone, but that's not a bad thing. Not as intuitive and feature packed as Android but very fast and smooth. Adapting to the IOS ecosystem is worthwhile because it's a different experience that takes a bit of effort, which is where the satisfaction comes. It's a Zen thing.",
            "Fabulous upgrade! All the perks of the 11 in a smaller package! Charges quickly and it’s so fast! Highly recommend!",

            "My daughter love this gadget x x",
            "Usual Argos good service from ordering to pick up. Phone does what is needed for, calls, texting, surfing and social media. I like Apple over android for security and the SE is a good value phone. Prefer the home button and finger print opening to Face ID of the iPhone X -11 No complaints.",
            "The new iPhone se is worth. Good price and amazing features. I recommend to everyone. And Argos delivery was ultra fast. I’ve order at night around 11pm I was with my new phone in the next morning.",

            "I have gone back to apple I phone as I could not get on with the Samsung phone. \nGlad to be back with I phone but I do wish the battery life was a little better. \nThe iPhone SE is somewhat less pricey to the more up to date iPhones but does the job and is everything you need from a phone. I would recommend the iPhone SE",

            "Very good to use enjoy",
            "Changed from Samsung S6, found this super fast and intuitive. Perfect size for one handed use, love the quality and I haven't wished the screen size is bigger at all.

            "Battery life and design fab",
            "Probably Apple’s best value product to date (after the 10.2” iPad). Some won’t like the smaller screen size, some won’t like the “chin” with Touch ID button but for those who prefer a smaller phone that can be used with one hand and fit easily in a trouser or jacket pocket then this is great. I don’t game on my phone but given the processor it shouldn’t be a problem. Do bear in mind though that this has a smaller battery than the 11 series.",

Bought this on buy now pay 6 months later. Ordered and paid online via Argos then went to Sainsbury’s (argos In store) to\nPick it up. It’s a really good phone design, features everything about it. As always with iPhones very easy to use. Definitely need a cover for it though because it’s so slim it could skip out of your hand.",

            "It’s very smooth to touch and it works rlly fast ,it’s not to heaver either",
            "It runs like a iPhone 11 his iPhone watch works like a dream everything he wanted",
            "Really good phone, it’s fast, it has a camera. Basically “it’s the best you’re going to get for the same price tag” - some video reviewer on youtube... he was right.",

            "I bought the iPhone SE to replace my old and very tired iPhone 5s and I am really only an occasional mobile user. Compared to my old iPhone this one is super quick to respond, easier to see the screen when outside and calls sound loader and clearer. The Touch ID has worked flawlessly. I haven’t really tested the camera. I have noticed I only seem to get emails through when I go into the email app, as far as I know I have set it up the same as my old 5s (it received emails without opening app).",
            "Very good iPhone for the price",

Works well, great pocketable size, long battery life and good camera.\nRecommended\nArgos experience was easy and worry free with click and collect at local store.",
            "Delivery in time, good price in the market",
            "very good lovely red",
            "Replacement for a iPhone 7+ - whilst in theory a downgrade - the SE has all the features needed plus a significant improvement on its previous incarnation.",
            "I bought this for my girlfriend as it's a similar size to her previous one. Easy to transfer all info from one to another, and as a plus, it has wireless charging.\nCheap for an iphone, but expensive in comparison with a top of the range android.",
            "Although the iPhone may have the same body shape and features as the iPhone 8, it's a great price and it's way more better than the iPhone 8, as in like the camera and the performance wise. The camera is the same as the iPhone 11 but except it hasn't got night mode. It does include a dark mode feature. The sound quality is great, clear sound, great bass. If you want a cheap but brand new iPhone that just relased, i recommend you purchasing this. No More AUX slot.",

            "Great iphone really impressed. My daughter is so happy with this phone. Definitely worth buying..highly recommended.",
            "Most phones are 5.5\"+ in size so it's good to see a phone which is pushing against the curve and not making it too big",
            "Picture quality is amazing x",
            "The wife was very happy.",
            "Very pleased with this Iphone. Lovely size and very easy to navigate especially for a technophobe like me   So much faster than previous 5s and with iOS 13 can now download all my apps I need.  Bit disappointed with battery max 2 days but would definitely recommend this phone.",
            "Bought this phone for my daughter and shes never been happier. The red stands out very nicely and is not too in your face. Battery lasts the whole day and the camera quality is extraordinary.\n100% would recommend",

            "Ordered online collected in local Sainsbury store with no problems at all. Not a fan of too large a screen for mobiles so the iPhone SE is a good fit for me, does everything I need at a much better value for money price than a iPhone 11.",
            "Perfect cheap version of an iPhone. Worth it for the price. I’ve had no problems with it yet. \nI’ve always bought iPhones since iPhone 3GS this is the first cheap version I’ve bought. And Compared to the rest it’s well worth it",
            "Phone is nice, slim body and nice to hold, usual Apple quality and I like the size. However it is a bit disappointing Apple did not put a more powerful battery in this phone, I know the system is well optimised but the battery could be better. It just about lasts a day but a heavy user would struggle with this battery.",
            "Had to buy the phone to pair with my new Apple series 5 watch. Love it as it’s much quicker than my iPhone 6.",

Especially for the price.\nIf you’re thinking of switching to apple or upgrading from an older iPhone, I would definitely recommend this one, the battery life is superb, the processor is super fast, and although the screen isn’t quite as high resolution as some of the more expensive iPhones, it’s perfectly suited to browsing social media, and doing all of your daily tasks! Definitely worth a look",

            "iPhone SE is just great to get back to a phone that you don’t need juggle in ten pairs of hands to use, great camera, 64gb which was enough for me, sleek and like I said, back to being a phone size not a big tablet",

            "It's worth £1000 with these specs so you can't go wrong! For me the battery seems pretty good, features are exceptional, the design is lovely and its Apple so you know you're in safe hands. I guess the only downside is the bezels (however these are forgotten as the iPhone has a dark mode option while on, and while off the iPhone is completely darkened in black.",
            "I bought this as a replacement for the 2016 SE model. 2020 model is lighter, bigger, better screen and battery life. Very pleased with it.",

            "Perfect replacement for my old version 7. Argos delivery exceptional, especially texting alerts close to delivery arrival.",
            "Converted from android to iPhone and won’t be looking back. Was previously put off by the high price of iPhones as I could not justify it for a phone however the SE(2020) has all the Newest iPhone Updates, great camera however has the benefit of the home button and is vastly cheaper. No sacrifice on quality. Argos’ next day delivery was an added bonus.",
            "Updated to this SE 2020 Great phone very clear good all round purchase",
            "I recommend new iPhone SE2. Previously I used iPhone SE old version and I think new SE is a very good solution for people who love apple's design and like to use the newest technology",
            "The phone is beautiful, the color is excellent. Very light",
            "Really good value for money and the camera is fantastic!!",

            "Does all you need . Great quality great camera battery life holds for days if not used",
            "The best is the price",
            "I had an iPhone 6 and prefer the small form factor and the old fashioned home button with Touch ID. I feel it’s far easier to use Apple Pay with Touch ID rather than Face ID. Much faster than my old iPhone. Same day Pickup from local Sainsbury’s was a doddle. No queue in the store.",
            "Best iPhone I’ve had, battery life is amazing!",
            "Great phone, great service from Argos.\nThe process they have in place for social distancing when collecting goods worked smoothly and kept everyone safe.",

            "Very good and new system",
            "Great phone fast and battery lasts long, had the iPhone 7 and went to this phone because it had the internals of the newer iPhone but in a smaller handset, which I liked.",
            "Nice phone easy to use feels nice to hold and can do lots with it.",
            "I only wanted a small phone but also to be up to date with the latest technology. This phone is a good price and I love that it is smaller than some of the other models.\nVery happy with my purchase.",
            "Good service,great phone. Arrived on time and I was kept fully up to date on progress.",
            "Brought this for my mums birthday! A nice upgrade from her iPhone 5. She lives the phone, it looks very smart and the red is a lovely red!",

            "Good quality simple iphone and cheap compared to other models. No issues with it",
            "Wasn’t sure about this due to the low price but get buying this is such a bargain! The same as more expensive iphones only difference I’ve noticed is no Face ID, which I knew about before. Very good phone for the money and without a doubt better than the iPhone 7/8. Battery is life very disappointing for a new phone but that is all. Wouldn’t let that put you off!! Great camera too!!",
            "good camera good phone all round",
            "The latest iPhone computing power and tech in an iPhone 8 body. It has the compact style and iOS power for a fraction of the price of the big screen versions. The screen is about 20% bigger than the original SE, which these days is handy. But it's still small enough to be comfortable to hold and fit in a pocket or bag. A decent sized phone that takes great pics and runs all the apps super quick. it's really good value.",
            "If you have to have an iPhone, this one is solid and cheap. However, the battery life is not excellent (as expert reviews suggest). \n\nAlso, transition from Android to iOS is not without problems. For example, some contacts didn't get transferred, and if I add them to iPhone again, next day they are gone. Plus there are other annoying issues like on all iPhones (such as impossible to use a custom mp3 as a ring tone, whatever I do, whatever tutorials I follow).",
            "Feels great looks great",
