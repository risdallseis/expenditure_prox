Which is alot better than charging twice a day with my old phone.\nThe camera is alright it does what it needs to do.. the only time I'm not satisfied with the camera is when it comes to evening time, even with the flash on the pictures doesn't come out decent but alright.\n\nGive the phone a chance it might be perfect for you. \nIt's decent for the price.",
