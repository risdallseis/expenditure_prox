It's a big screen phone which is actually the really disappointing thing, as there's 9mm gap at the bottom, between where the actual 'viewing' screen ends and the glass screen ends. Why they made it this big when you can't view on the full screen i don't know, probably a selling point ! (See pic)",

            "This is the second Motorola smartphone I've had. I accidentally smashed my last one (my fault) but was happy to buy another moto phone. This is a new and improved model. The battery life on these is really good, and the screen is bright and large enough to make it comfortable to use. It's pretty much standard Android pre-installed without loads of manufacturer's apps that I don't want anyway. I've successfully installed all my regular apps, and got it set up quickly. The camera seems pretty good - you may get better on more expensive phones, but this does produce nice sharp images, and has a great macro mode for really close up. It's got a healthy 64GB of storage which can be expanded by adding a memory card. I like the graded blue colour of the case too. Altogether I'm very happy with this purchase.",

            "I bought this as I needed more capacity on my phone. Battery life is a bit disappointing if you actually use apps and browse , If used primarily for phone and texting the battery hold up . \nQuite slow to charge",
            "I bought this for my Mum as she was using one of my old mobiles so I decided to get her up to date. She Loves this Motorola G8 Power Lite,  in fact I would probably invest in one or similar for myself, so much packed in for a low price.",

            "This phone was bought due to the long battery life. It is a good size phone with lots of features . I think you need to have some knowledge of mobiles to use this to it’s fullest. Bought for my partner who is struggling to find the basics-ie how to make a call, message . With a little bit of tuition he is improving",
            "Wasn't expecting much for the cost, I was replacing g4 work phones and couldn't believe how much better the budget phones have got. It is a large narrow width phone and has everything you would want, set up was easy using the Google prompt preset into the phone on start up. I knew the processor was not the latest but you can navigate around the phone no problem with no glitches. Would recommend.",

However I needn't have worried. It was really simple to transfer all my 'stuff' and just followed the instructions on screen. I love my new phone and got a lovely case off ebay for it. The camera takes great pictures and I use it a lot with my family when we're out and about. There's plenty of storage which was a problem with my last one. I can listen to music and its clear. Basically it does everything I need it to do. Oh and can use it as a satnav also! Would highly recommend it. It is slightly larger and that took a bit of getting used to when making a call, as its also a bit heavier than I was used to. But all in all great for the price. Very pleased.",
            "Very happy with this Fone and battery eis great as promised",
            "I bought this last month and it provides me with everything I need.",
            "These phones can give the expensive phones a run for there money, quick to load pages and battery life is excellent I would recommend anyone to get one of these little beauties",
            "My previous phone had water damage so needed a new phone quick,  I have had Motorola g phone before in fact the the last 3 in the series.  It may be the price I don't but but this is a step down from previous models.  The camera quality is terrible.  Even in daylight the photos come out dark and need editing,  The camera is extremely laggy, it takes forever to take the shot and the pictures are not crisp and clear you have to edit every single photo.  The speaker is at the back of the phone so if you lay phone flat like most people do it muffles the sound.  The whole design of this phone feels off.  I needed as an emergency so will keep it because of the price, but really not pleased with.  Its a very basic starter phone at best.",
            "Good phone, long battery life",
            "This is my third Motorola phone  won't buy anything else. Terrific value and you don't feel so bad about renewing every couple if years, as only costs £1 per  week! Large memory, terrific camera, fast processor, long battery life. Highly recommended.",
            "Not the most expensive phone on the market by a long way, but why pay for speed. memory, apps and other facilities that I don't need. This phone does exactly what I want, and is easy to use. The transfer of apps and data from my old (damaged) phone went seamlessly, and I became used to my new one in no time. In my view, this is my best phone yet. I make video calls, text, take photos, measure the distance I walk, check emails, look stuff up on Google, and much else besides. Well done Moto!",

            "I am getting to grips with it but it does too much for my liking",
            "I bought this phone because it has a large screen and a long-lasting battery and, sure enough, it has a large screen and a long-lasting battery.  I use the phone for texting, phone calls, and a few utility purposes like banking, checking train times, reading the news and weather and listening to BBC Sounds.  For the price I paid it looks good (to me) and I think it represents very good value.  I hope it will last me for several years but if you need a state-of-the-art bit of kit, then I suspect you will find this phone wanting.",
            "I bought this a week ago as the price was WOW. It is really wow, for the lowest money I paid, I got extremely good quality phone with enough memory and power to play games, etc. thanks Argos!!!",

Although I'm still getting used to my purchase I can honestly say lovely phone an great service from Argos.",
            "This is a decent smartphone, considering the price. Things that I must mention - the battery lasts for ages, one charge goes for 2 days with moderate use. The screen, camera and common features are just standard as other androids. One slightly off-putting thing is the speed. Before this phone, I had Samsung S7 and S8. Compare to those phones, the average response when I am trying to open a new app/working with multiple apps, is sluggish. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.",

The phone wouldn't let me change the ringtone or notifications. It sometimes wouldn't let me swipe the screen or access emails. I returned it to the store. Would not recommend this phone",
            "This phone does everything that 99% of users will ever need. There's 44GB of free space straight out the box with no bloatware at all. It's fast, responsive and the screen is huge. The camera is great for video calls and it has 2 full-size SIM card slots and an SD card slot as well. Despite having a big 5000mAh battery it only lasts the same as my 3000mAh one and be sure to use the fast charger it comes with or it takes 5 hours to charge! Overall, a brilliant buy that'll do everything you need.",
            "Comes with a handy cover to protect from drops very handy for me. Also comes with charger but no head phones. Just wish it would charge faster but the battery does last a lot longer",

The voices are really clear and good sound quality. An added bonus is it comes with a strong, clear phone case attached. \nI am so pleased I bought this. A great buy at a very affordable price.",
            "have been a fan of Motorola phones for a long time because they are generally well designed, reliable and value for money. The G8 power lite doesn't disappoint and considering it is just under £100, it is excellent value. The screen is slightly larger than my G7 power, it has 4GB RAM and 64GB storage so plenty of room for apps as well as photos and music. The 5000mAh battery lasts for a couple of days with reasonable use; games, streaming etc. I could say more but no space!",
            "A good phone . I bought as an upgrade to change my old Motorola g7.",
            "The phone was easy to set up as I bought it to replace an earlier version. It has useful features such as finger tip recognition, torch, etc I find the wake -up a bit slow though that may just be a settings issue I have yet to discover. I found the absence of a user manual guide (or a pdf file I could download) a disadvantage - even though the HTML online is useful and has all the information, it requires wifi connection or the use of your mobile data - not so good if you are a payg customer.",
            "google android controls the user - I paid for the phone yet it belongs and the data content\nbelongs to google that it sells on. Must switch off the location and disable the apps- turn off the noise- make it your phone. It even knows when you are on another device!!!",
            "This is an impressive phone which performs solidly. It wasn't too bad to set up though the lack of WPS was frustrating as was the fiddly sim card slot.\n\nGetting photos etc transferred was straightforward and it has a good battery life even with heavy use.\n\nI especially like the font size variations as my eyes are not as good these days. \n\nOverall, a smooth, reliable phone.",

It a nice big size, the battery life is very good last me up to 3 days and I haven't yet found any fault with the phone yet.",
            "I am very pleased with this phone especially the battery.",
            "I bought this as replacement. As soon as I saw this I knew it was exactly what I wanted and I haven't been  disappointed. The colour is gorgeous  but it is so easy to use. It is bigger than my old one, also a Motorola, but I am so glad I made the decision to buy it. If you are looking for a reasonably priced  smart phone, you won't  go wrong with this one.",
            "Needed another comparatively cheap phone and this one fits the bill. Fine so far. Getting used to it. The other cheap phone is slowing down and the battery life is getting shorter after only 6 months. Maybe it is cheaper in the long too get these value phones even if they need replacing more often as we all know what new I phones etc cost. Do buy this phone it is OK quite fast dual sim and will these sort of things go up?",
            "Its nice worth mobile to use great charging capacity less weight too...",

            "Very pleased I bought this. Helpful that the battery was partially charged straight out of the box, enabling quick start up. The battery lasts well for me - approx. 5 days. The main camera seems good. The protector case that comes with it is a nice touch. The only negative point I've found is that the screen is annoying and flashy when you first turn the phone on - I just turn it face down and ignore it while it's doing that. But I rarely turn it off, so no big issue. Happy with my phone.",

I was a bit dubious of the colour but all the specs fitted my needs so I purchased. I'm not disappointed, the screen is larger than previous which took a bit of getting used to but otherwise excellent. Oh and the colour (for those of you are interested) - sooo much better than I thought.",
            "Love the phone, easy to use and very good value",
            "For the price I paid I couldn't be happier. it runs apps such as discord, steam & Xbox gaming apps like a charm. The battery lasts very well.",

            "Got it for my mum for mother day she love it",
            "I love Moto phones and this one did not disappoint. A solid almost phablet with protective cover included. The phone really is very big and a little heavy. The 64GB is a good size. Phone speed is acceptable but not snappy. The camera is ok. The one disappointment was that it charges with a mini-USB not a USB-C but that's the only niggle. Otherwise deserved 4 stars.",

So good price, functions well, and charge lasts a long time.\nCamera isn't too great. It brightens all of your pictures and you can't really turn it off, but I'd say it's a decent tradeoff for the price/other features.",

            "Great easy to use phone.",
            "Purchased this phone based on its spec (64G) and other reviews and then changed my contract to sim only (lower cost and better data).

I like the idea of different quality photos but want to know how to do it   Oh for a paper instruction book.  I think we should have the option of a manual at point of sale.  On the up side, I can answer calls on this, I haven't been able to for a while on my old faithful G4. I'm an oldie, but I'm getting on ok with my G8 power lite.",

            "After listening to my wife complaining about her old mobile for about a month I decided to buy her this new MOTO G8 for Valentines Day \nNot much more expensive than flowers and chocolates but will keep her happy for a lot longer    Thank You",
            "Still getting used to it. Battery life is great. Notification settings are over complicated. Pretty happy so far.",
            "This phone is practical with 3 day battery; transfer from old phone was remote so all photos and features were transferred overnight from a previous android; I also bought a cover with flip closure which acts as a wallet in covid times as a slot for my bank card.",
            "This is a really good phone for the price.  Easy to set up big clear screen and quite fast . 10/10 I can't fault in any way",

            "Battery keep longer than I expected.",
            "I needed a new phone fast and fortunately Argos had this Motorola in stock. The design is sleek, it comes with a protective case and the responsiveness is great. The battery life is excellent. Once it is fully charged it lasts for about 3 days straight. I would highly recommend this as a top end budget phone. It has 32gb internal storage and i have added another 32gb sd card. Enough said.",

            "The only thing that lets it down is the processing speed\nIt shouldn't be using outdated processor for a bang up to date phone. Still, for the money it's a good buy unless you need enhanced performance.",
            "Very good phone does the job. \nWell worth the price. \nNice design.\n\nMinus if you spend a bit more you get much better specs so it is better to upgrade.",
            "Excellent for the price. Large screen which I never had but I am really glad I went for it. Advantages with this model are large storage, long lasting battery life and simple set up. The camera is not that of an expensive  phone, but if that is the most important facet of a phone to you then get a phone for that. The camera is still very adequate despite that. If listening to music is your bag, the sound with headphones in particular is very good. This is a fine phone for the price point.",
            "Compared to the more expensive phones out there you can't go wrong with the Motorola G8 Power light, brought it for my son for his birthday he absolutely loves it, at first the screen did seem rather big but you'll get used to , now he is also getting his girlfriend one now because they're so impressed , nice sound clear , screen and fast what more can I say.",

            "A really nice phone, very pleased with it so far. Good battery life, charges really quick. Great camera, big memory. The only thing I'm not keen on is when someone calls it doesn't come up on the screen, I have to swipe down to see who's calling and it's not easy to see. Just a matter of getting used to it I guess.",
            "The phone is amazing not even considering the cheap price tag.\nIt performs without any fault, the screen is crisp and perfect for video watching.\nThe battery lasts a full day on an almost nonstop use.\nI am so happy with it and would recommend it to anyone.\n\nI also got a phone cover included with it which was a very welcomed bonus.",

            "Bought it for mobile tethering. My partner already had Moto G7 Power and decided to take this G8 Power Lite instead and use the G7 for the tethering. Initially it seemed like a better phone (which you'd expect from a newer model) but after couple of weeks of usage and research it's definitely not the case. It's great for the current price for sure, but definitely a step down from the G 7 Power.",

            "Great phone. Easy to use with the large screen. Pictures are perfect and videos clear with great sound. I don't use it for a lot so don't have many apps installed so can't really tell if the battery lasts as long as what it say it does but after playing with it constantly for four days it still had 30% power. Takes a while to charge but well worth the price in my opinion.",

            "This is a larger format phone and good value for money at the price. The large battery is great for long life/heavy use but if uses a standard micro USB not USB-C to charge,\nIt comes with a soft plastic case (doesn't cover the screen) which was a bonus i didn't see in the spec.\nCamera and screen spec are normal for this price range but have presented me with no problems at all, the screen is bright and clear but i wouldn't choose if if photography was my hobby.",
            "Great phone. Brilliant camera and video. Amazing value. You will not get a better phone for your money anywhere.",

            "I have an iPhone and bought this for my girlfriend who prefers Android. She’s super pleased with it - it looks really good, great size, beautiful big screen, takes good photos and has a really good battery life. Would’ve liked to have wireless charging and face recognition lock but the fingerprint lock works well and for the price it’s really decent and can’t really complain.Bonus getting a clear case with it but doesn’t come with headphones.

            "I held off from buying this phone for a while and looked for others as was aware it was pretty large and quite heavy. I eventually bought it due to the price, RAM, GB and battery life. Overall im very happy with it, it is big and quite heavy (i have small hands) but i have got used to it and now i appreciate the large screen. It was so easy to set up, has a fab battery life and looks pretty smart too. For under a ton you cant ask for much more.",

            "I have been using this phone for a few weeks and I love it.\nI don't have intense phone requirements but I am on it a lot and the performance is faultless. The battery lasts me two days of pretty heavy use, and it charges up very quickly.\nUnfortunately, it didn't come with a screen protector so I have invested in a few.\nThis was about as much as I wished to pay and I'm very happy with the value. I've been using this brand for years and I love it.",
            "Purchased as a relatively cheap new 'smartphone' primarily based on the price and advertised battery life. The battery lasts more than a week if you make a handful of calls and send a handful of text or whatsapp messages. Video playback is quick and picture quality good.Downsides - you have to give lots of permission and privacy away to use features of the phone; to use the good camera you have to allow Google to take pictures when they want (!!). Big screen means two hands needed for typing.",

            "Bought this to replace an old mobile with failing battery. Very quick to sync all contacts etc from the other one. Good memory (64g) and have had no issues since purchase. The colour was supposed to be blue but looks blackish. \nRecommended.",
            "There's not a lot you can't do with this phone.  The battery is a good size too so the number of times it runs should be much less. It has a nice feel to it and the screen is very clear. There's a high res camera. Having Android 9 it performs in the same way as many others which cost over twice as much. If I have a concern, its the length of it but that's what a big battery brings.",

            "Bought this for my daughter to replace an old Moto E4 which was getting slow and kept running out of memory. She seems very happy with it, it is much faster than the E4 and she hasn't run out of memory yet. I was slightly surprised that it uses micro USB and not USB type C.",

Quite a big phone but my child says quickly get used to size.\nGreat battery life and storage space.\nBeing used to aid home schooling as no other electronic means and no issues switching between apps.\nWould recommend buying but check the size first as it is quite a large phone.",

            "This phone exceeded my expectations. The plug part of the charger doesn’t fit my standard UK socket at home but I had an old phone charger which I use. Apart from that I find the screen and the camera pretty good. The battery will last more than 5 days if I don’t use the phone. Under constant use I still get more than 24 hours.",

Had to contact Motorola after having the phone for only 5 weeks about this problem. Went through some trouble shooting resets and seems to have made a difference. Not happy with having to go through this as previous Motorola phones had worked well and lasted long. Maybe I just got a bad egg or Motorola are not what they was..",

Have spent about 3 full days transferring and personalising new phone. Endless forum reading to find out how to do stuff. Had the time otherwise would have paid up for wondershare. App locks don't work properly, no wireless charging and worse thing no Otter box case to protect it . But in the end I'm glad I've swopped.",

Very easy to switch all data from old phone, even I managed it! I did have difficulty finding a case for it though. None of my local phone shops could supply so had to go online for one. Good battery life of at least 2 days for me, though this depends on what you have switched on. Overall I am very happy with it and hope I get as long a time with it as my last Moto.",

            "Bought as a replacement phone after a more expensive phone got water damage. For its price its excellent value. Big large screen and comes with a clear plastic back protector. The camera does well for general photo's & a good amount of storage. It's biggest draw back if you want to watch media or listen to music is the speaker on the rear so loss of sound quality and you can never place it down on flat surface when listening. Not a problem if you want to hold it all the time or wear headphones.",

Other than that I think it's a really decent phone although battery life isn't as amazing as reviews would have you believe. Nice that it came with a case as well.\nIn short it's a decent phone for a decent price!",

            "I moved from Apple to Huawei a few years ago and have no regrets. My Huawei was getting a bit slow so settled on the Moto G8 Power Lite mainly because of 64gb memory, 4gb ram, price and reviews.\nSo far so good, it's responsive, easy to navigate, great camera, do not disturb feature is good as I don't have to remember to put my phone on vibrate at night as you can set it to switch automatically at whatever time you like. I haven't come across any negatives yet and therefore would recommend.",

Big screen, big battery, modern operating system, fingerprint reader and a decent camera with macro mode. There are phones out there with better specifications but why waste money on a name when this will get the job done, sim-free, pay as you go, no great monthly bills.",
            "The phone looks good and feels good.sleak but big so you can easily read the screen.\n\nEasy to use.\n\nBattery life not the best considering the size and when the battery had started to run out it brought up Chinese writing and needed a factory reset to bring back on line so may change the score of this repeats",

            "This phone is really well priced for its specification \n.The battery life is as good as the as promoted, the phone only needs charged every other day at worst. \nThe size of the phone may put some people off it as it is larger than most smart phones.",
