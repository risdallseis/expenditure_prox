It's still good for the Vaccination passport as long as you remember to print out a paper copy at home and not expect to bring it up on the phone at the airport, it probably wouldn't work without a wifi connection.\nOtherwise a good phone for the price.

On account of the family constantly sending pics, I've put a 32Gb SD card in the phone so that the pics don't use up too much phone memory.

            "Not being a very 'teccy' person, I wasn't a massive fan of smartphones but did require something which had the capabilities of handling 'Whatsapp' application for work purposes. Having done a bit of research, I decided I didn't want to take photos from 10 miles away, but wanted a phone built to decent standard with the latest features, and also future-proof to an extent. The Alcatel 1C being the next to base smartphone in the range ticked all the boxes.",

            "Great first mobile for our 11 year old, he's downloaded lots of apps so far without running out of space though some surprisingly incompatible. Camera seems a bit poor, always seems to have screen on max brightness so difficult to know how good battery life is. Used it a fair bit daily though - calling friends, playing games and youtube videos (all responsibly!). Serves its purpose well -cheap SIM free phone that will help get him to and from school safely and keep in touch with friends.",

            "The phone is ok but it's frustrating to type msg correctly. The camera is also not what I expected. I think it's not worth of money. The box was not sealed when I received it so I hope argos can return my purchase.",

            "Really annoyed following this purchase. From memory product description states compatible with any/all networks, which presumably is the case. However, what is not clear is that it doesn't take a standard SIM. Under normal circumstances perhaps relatively trivial. But when purchased for an eighty year old friend in case of her admission to hospital, and then needed for precisely this reason this fundamental oversight left her in a highly vulnerable and compromising position.",

Seems to be good quality and was easy to set up, and is easy to use. Everything (calls, texts, apps, camera, wi-fi, data, etc.) works well.

            "I bought this phone as a temporary replacement whilst mine was away for repair. It performs well for the price. The camera isn't the highest spec and there isn't much memory so it does feel a little slow at times but maybe that's because I've gone from an Samsung to this. It would probably make a good first smart phone for children but just note that because the phone spec isn't that high, some apps/games may not be compatible with the phone - I found this out with my banking app.",

As the only negatives I researched were that it struggled with too many apps, this is not a problem for me. The design is great and I can set the phone to auto turn of and on the next day.

            "This is a smart(ish) phone that does the job and yet it is at a price does not leave me obsessed with the fear of loss or damage. The move away from my cheap phone+cheap Kindle Fire combination has been along time coming, and this one was the first product that  fitted the bill. Battery life seems OK, Camera OK, ease of use- good,, Value- excellent.",
            "Nice weight, charges up in reasonable time and standby time is fine. Basically it does what I need it to do. It does have slots for two SIMs.\n\nIt took a while to find how to get the back off so I could put the SIM and battery in. (With the phone face down it's the bottom left corner.)",

I was dreading mine going for repair, I needn't have worried, apart from the Spen, which I find invaluable with my osteoarthritis, this phone is as good, does what I need it to do. Be a brilliant back up.\nI was pleasantly surprised at how good it is, being an unlocked dual sim, I can have a pay as you go sim, with a different network as a back up, fantastic.",
            "Bought two of these for my parents. Needed an easy to use phone. Ease of use was ok and easy to set up for me but there’s no manual inside to explain more to 70+ yr old. Which was frustrating. However phone is priced well. It’s good for a starter android phone.",

            "I bought it solely to use in Japan as a navigation tool with google maps. It was useless for this app as it couldn’t keep up with the pace that I was walking!",
            "I bought this for my daugher as a replacement as her other phone broke the phone it self is easy to use  but once putting her sim in will not let her use her mobile data she has after looking on line it seems a few people have the same issue",

She loves it, it does pretty much anything you could want a phone to do including internet and photos etc. Its not powerful enough for games but at this price who cares?

Highly Recommended. Go for it. !",

The Android version is not the full version so some apps don't work. Not big on memory and a little slow, but pretty good for a cheap phone.  Sound is good and battery lasts well. Data is slow when not connected to WiFi.",
