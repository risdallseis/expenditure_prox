            "My granddaughter uses  it every day,  has the odd glitch but she says it's great. Easy to use and good graphics. Down side is the battery could last a little longer, but uses it a lot on line So battery life won't be great.  But 4 to 5 hours is long enough to stare at a screen. So it gives her an excuse to put it down. That can't be a bad thing. Otherwise very happy with the purchase and i would by again .",

But if I got one again I would go for the bigger memory 32gb .  The 16g  a lot is taken up by apps already installed.\nSaying that I have not looked into installing extra mem card. Worth looking into it. \nie. Will it help much,for the extra cost of card compaired to cost of the 32g model. Overall I am happy with it.",

Isn't able to access a particular banking app which was annoying, but cannot be sure if that is down to the product or the app so won't hold it against the tablet!",

            "Great little tablet apart from voice recognition. Boots up and responds instantly but when it comes to voice recognition it is all over the place, bringing up words that bear no relation to what has been said.

The battery lasts for the duration that we require, it connects easily to the internet and also we use the Bluetooth all day to link a cars machine. We use it to browse the internet also and it's pretty quick. We haven't had any issues with any of the apps that we use. The screen is large and it's quite durable. It's not the lightest but I prefer that from a tablet.",
            "Was very pleased with my previous Lenovo tablet, so decided to upgrade to a later model.\nNot disappointed with my decision. This tablet is very fast, has great speakers and the picture quality is very good. The fact you can also increase storage means I can download so much more than on the previous version. \nGreat tablet for the money. Very pleased.",
            "Value for money, good battery life, fast charging fast and easy to use - Downside for arthritic pensioner like me is getting used to the size after a 7\" tablet - Upside is that it's easy to read the sharp natural coloured screen - Recommend buying SD card to enlarge the memory - Really pleased",

            "Really good product, using for games only though",
            "Great tab for the kids or parents. Easy to use and cant do anything  to wrong. Camera takes a lovely photo with good clarity and colour. Great for books and cartoons. For me the image response wasn't great on movies and picture often pixelated. It is lightweight and easy to handle. The battery takes a long time to charge. It's best feature has to be the multiple users and the kids can have their own account without messing mine up. A great product  from a great brand.",
            "Smart looking tablet, that is easy to set up and use. \nPre installed apps on home screen to help use the tablet\nEasy to use and move about the tablet\nBattery is long lasting and easy to charge\nGreat tablet for children or adults",
            "This tablet is of fantastic build quality, solid and sturdy screen & frame with superb sound & picture detail. It is thin and light so makes handling it easy and comfortable which is always a plus.\n\nI haven't noticed any lag in typing with the keyboard and it's load speeds are extremely quick. It has a good quality camera, Dolby Audio front facing speakers & Dual Band WiFi capability.\n\nA terrific tablet I'd recommend to anyone!",
            "This is is lightweight bight and sleek the colours a bright and beautiful and the sound quality is great easy use internet access and set up however downloading and closing apps was impossible the camera quality is dreadful between the three of us very tech savvy people none of us could get on with it my daughter was so excited to use it and after finding it lacks simple technical qualities she hasn’t bothered with it since I wouldn’t personally recommend this it’s very frustrating to use",
            "It's okay. \nPros: picture quality and sound quality are good. \nNice size for travelling.\nBattery life appears to be quite good. \n\nCons: feels cheap - slightly bendable, annoying vibration when touching the screen.\nFeels like it would shatter/ break very easily. \nNot always very responsive to touch. \n\nOverall: Fine if you want something that does the job but is certainly not all singing and dancing.",
            "This tablet is a good all round entry level tablet and good value for money. \nAlthough not Full HD the display is clear and bright enough to enjoy watching movies complimented by a very decent pair of stereo front firing speakers delivering good sound quality. \nGiven that it is an entry tablet, the slightly sluggish response is expected. \nBattery life is a strong point. My grandchildren (4 + 6 - couldnt put it down!) have depleted it several times, lasting about 6 hours of life. \nEasy setup",
            "Wow I love this tablet. It set up in minutes unlike my iPad which was an hour plus. Apps download in 30 seconds. Cameras are great and it’s fast. Picture quality is really good and the tablet is so light compared to the iPad. I’d thoroughly recommend this product.",
            "Setup was incredibly easy, there were prompts throughout and a good explanation of what each stage was.\nI think this would be a great 1st tablet (both for adults and children). It was extremely easy to navigate, light to hold and the graphics were bold and clear.\nI was happy to see that there was a parental controls and kids mode section.\nThere is an option to use a memory card with the tablet if you reach storage limit, it is also a very good price for what you get.",
            "Great piece of tech for the price, very sensitive , face recognition, fast speed, brilliant sound, and fantastic picture quality, ideal for youngsters who tend not to be careful with things, screen marks easily so would recommend a screen protector, used for watching films and social media, only problem I found was with social media it displayed it very big and cut off the beginning of the page, screen rotation was very annoying. Charge lead Length way too small, so you have to be sat at plug.",
            "I think this tab is great for kids or elderly parents. Its functionality is basic but gives good results. Personally I think the video quality is not the best as can be pixelated but wouldn't be an issue with cartoons etc. Camera takes a lovely picture and is good for kindle books. If you're used to apple or Samsung then you may be left disappointed. But as an entry tab it does the job well and the battery life is great.",
            "This is a great tablet, loads up really fast turns on in like 30 seconds. Has some good apps preloaded like Netflix, Skype and Gmail which is great to occupy and video call family during these times especially. Good camera and screen quality for pictures and watching films is great. Best app I've found so far is the kids zone! My 4.5yr old loves it there's stories that play aloud for them to listen to, ones on there too for older kids to read. Kids games and songs too!",
            "From opening the box, this Android tablet is straightforward to use. Once charged, there are simple instructions to set up, sync with a phone, emails etc.  There are a number of default apps on the home screen and everything else can be found in the Play Store.  It’s easy to navigate, no lag or touch screen issues, parental settings if needed, a fantastic all rounder for any age group. I used daily for a couple hours streaming, general online browsing/shopping, and the battery lasted a week.",
            "The tablet was well packaged, upon opening I was pleasantly surprised at how light and thin the tablet was.\nSet up was extremely easy, a few simple taps on the screen and we were good to go. You can link the tablet to your current info such as emails, documents and social media. \nUsing the tablet is again very easy to do, self explanatory enough that my young son is able to use it. It has a kids mode and is password enabled. \nThe screen is big, the sound quality is great.\nA fantastic tablet.",
            "A neat and effective tablet. It has a nano-SIM card slot. It is easy to set up, no problems setting up my e-mail and transferring contacts and apps from my phone. \nGood quality display and auto-rotate screen. \nThe quality of pictures and videos taken is excellent as is the playback quality from i-player. Multiple user facility. Battery life approx. 6 hours and about 3 hours to charge.",
            "I’ve had only ever had one brand of tablet in the past And I thought I would never stray from this brand but since having a Lenovo laptop I was excited to try there tablet. I’m very impressed so much that we no longer need the other tablet. It’s super fast to power up, graphics and colours are amazing with plenty of choice of free apps for my son from the play store. Set up was super simple and I love the fact that there is a child account option to keep the children safe while playing.",
            "The size is great, especially as kids are now doing online learning. The sound quality is good but the carema isn't great. Everything you'd expect from an android device. Easily linked to other accounts. Comes with SD card or sim card slot. 16gb memory but most of it is taken up by system files, which is rubbish. Case readily available online.",
            "I was sceptical getting the Lenovo tablet as it’s not a name I associated with quality. I was so wrong. It’s roughly the same size as an iPad but has an android operating system. If your new to android it may take a while to get used too. It’s very quick and responsive and easy to download apps. It feels quite light but I love that about it. Very easy to take out with you for the day or on holiday. The only thing I would say is if you are purchasing this product remember to order a cover.",
            "This tablet was shiny and sleek. Really easy to use and the the instructions were easy to follow. The screen graphics are excellent and watching a film was great, good picture. Searching the internet was quick and easy. This is a brilliant tablet for all ages and easy to use!!!",
            "Very impressed with the quality of the picture. Full HD from a 10.1\" screen. To the right  is a standard headphone jack plus a usbc2 port and a micro sd card slot. On the left  are the power and volume buttons while at the bottom is a connector for a dock. With regards to the sound I was impressed. This particluar model has 2gb of ram and 16gb storage.Games run well and the performance is good. \nWhat I do like is that there are few pre-installed apps, All in all, a very impressive tablet.",
            "Set up is very easy, if you have a google account. Just follow the on-screen prompts.\nThe screen size is good but the picture quality is not great. Both sharpness and brightness could be better. The cameras are OK for basic use.\nIt is not very responsive and can be slow to react to screen presses.\nThe Android OS appears to be bloat free.\nI find it to be fine for web browsing and basic tasks.\nOverall this is not a bad starter tablet and it would be great for kids.",
            "Very rhin and light\nBut once done very easy to us\nDoes not take micro or old type sim card\nGood quality camera\nHad to copy my mobile to load\nVery good visual display\nVery robust body\nQuick to respond to touch\nExcellent sound system"
