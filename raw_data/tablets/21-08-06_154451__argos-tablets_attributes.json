            "I’ve had it for 3 weeks now can’t fault it. The charger dock is still solid, which I’ve found to be a problem with most tablets, especially when young children are involved!",
            "Got as a replacement as my sons got smashed. Good for a 9yo for youtube and games. The charger stopped working after a week but they are cheap enough to replace",

            "The model sold is the 10Q which is not the same as the 10 advertised on the web site, There is no USB 2 socket as advertised. It is overpriced, I should have guessed as there are two flimsy plastic covers included in the package. The sound is tinny, my Kindle Fire 5 sounds better.",
            "Well worth the price !",

            "Well, it’s a good price for a such nice product. Then only reason I am not so happy is because, I have to return it back! After my kid being used it for twee weeks the table started making noises from inside. My kid is every sad that I have to return it back. I have decided now to paying a little bit more and getting other table instead...!",

            "the tablet is fine for checking the internet whilst watching the many hours of TV I enjoy every night. its obviously quite large for a tablet and therefore quite heavy. it can be a bit slow but thats probably due to my wi fi being in a different room. great value.",

            "Bought this tablet expecting to be able to use it for Netflix etc however within LESS THAN AN HOUR of use, I came to the conclusion that it was not fit for purpose so. I tried to get a refund however this was not possible as the screen was, and I quote \"covered in scratches\". Upon further inspection scratches of any description yet to be found. I will be attempting to return it again however if it is rejected again, I will be selling it on Ebay so potential buyers, keep your eyes open for that!!",
            "tablet is all good; for the money i cant moan",

            "I purchased this alba tablet about 3 weeks ago, I had an email offering support due to a problem with it, which occurred after a week, absolutely NO response from Argos whatsoever\nVery dissatisfied with them, the problem with the tablet is it keeps 'flickering' rapidly",
            "Easy to order and arrived on time!",

            "Good value, easy to setup.",
            "You can't expect a lot for this price. I mainly got it to do facetime calls etc, and the camera isn't really good enough for that. \n\nIt's sort of alright if you need a spare or a backup for basic web browsing and some apps. But it's been sitting unused, as it's pretty slow, so not that much fun to use. Might be a good basic kids tablet, as it comes with bouncy tablet protectors.",

            "good tablet for the price, however only wanted it to browse the internet and not download.",
            "This is a really good tablet. It has a pretty decent battery life and even if it runs out I can still watch YouTube videos while it's actually charging. The memory is double my last tablet and apps etc download very quickly. The only downside so far is the sound quality which is ok but not as good as my old tablet and the camera quality which is really poor.",
            "it has a long battery life, easy to use and plenty of space for several games.",
            "Brilliant tablet and for the price for what come with it 2 cases as well and screen protector so i think its a bargain",
            "Easy to set up and use well worth it definitely would recommend.",
            "Poor quality, nice tablet comes with 2 cases, just poor camera quality",

            "Easy point of collection.Works welland good value for the money paid",
            "Unfortunately I found out the hard way that you get what you pay for. Maybe I was just unlucky but I only loaded up a game on the tablet and it wouldn’t work, hardly ever loaded up to play. In my experience with it I wouldn’t recommend. It’s being refunded thanks to Argos.",
            "bought as wanted something to use while in hospital. found it too be a great wee tablet so far. not had any problems with it. its the first tablet ive owned, so obviously cant compare it to other makes, but im happy with it. only wee problem is cant find a screen protector for it.",

            "I bought this tablet for my sons 8th birthday, he had always used by samung tablet prior to this one. \nThe battery barely lasts a day, compared to 2-3days for samsung. This tablet has to be charged everynight, which is very frustrating. Also it takes a long time for the battery to be 100%.",
            "Too slow to charge for too little use. Charger lead connection poor and easily dislodged and also laggy connection \nDisappointed 9 year old Roblox fan asked to return in the day after purchase\nPrice is reasonable though",

            "Bought this for my 5 year old, it's a good little tablet and does everything he needs it to do; so it's good for watching annoying videos and playing games with annoying music.\n\nComing with two protective cases is a nice touch, although if it was for someone any younger you might need something more robust.",
            "Just bought  this tablet 19 March for my grandsons birthday only been used ones and making ward noise taking it back",
            "I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. The screen is a good size and the battery lasts around 8 hrs of constant use. The fact that it comes with two rubber covers in case it gets dropped is a bonus although it seems quite sturdy without them on. I would highly recommend if your buying one for a child!!",
            "easy to use light to transport on holidays",
            "For the price this tablet is brilliant, it starts up quickly & apps load just as fast, picture quality is very good with good contrast. I don't play games online so I can't comment on that, though I do watch quite a lot of online video and these play perfectly.\nFor everyday use it is perfect. The battery lasts 6-7 hours of constant use,.\nThis is the 2nd Alba tablet I've had, the last one still works, but is five years old and is getting a bit slow, this one seems like a very good replacement.",
            "As advertised.  Delivered quick.",
            "My kids loved the laptops and the covers are their favourites. It was reasonable and I ordered the same day and collect the same day. Thank you.",
            "This tablet is ok as a first tablet. Ideal for a child. But not if you don't like waiting for apps to load. \nBut then it is one of the cheapest tablets around and you pay for what you get.\nNot for me though. I took it back and exchanged it.",
            "I think this an efficient tablet. I only use it for online shopping and gaming. It's easy set up.  Battery not to bad depending on what your using it for!  It take good quality photos!",

            "This tablet is meeting my needs. I brought it for my young son to watch video n video demand app. It is sufficient and speedy is ok. 2 tablet cases are included. So it is value for money. However it is quite heavy. But it is acceptable for the price.",

            "I got this simply for doing my electric certificates. Didn't need an all singing and dancing tablet, just a functional one. This is plenty quick for my needs, memory is more than enough, connectivity spot on. \nBasically it does what it says on the tin. Love the fact you get 2 yes 2 silicon type covers, perfect for me as I've dropped it once, protected it no problem. For the price you can't complain or go wrong. \nThe camera is not the best in low light, but perfect for my needs",

Got this tablet for my son after an accident with his previous... big screen great for watching movies or Netflix and has plenty space for his face games like roblox and bed wars.. battery life I think you would get about 4/5 hours of constant play out of it. We are happy with the purchase and would recommend.",

            "Got 2 of these to replace (very) old 8inch Acer tablets for kids. They are great. Unbeatable for the price. Decent amount of memory (32gb), good screen, performs pretty well and you get 2 free protective cases for it! Only downside is that the battery will not last for days but it is a budget tablet and still lasts for quite a while when in use. Highly recommend these tablets. Absolute bargain.",
            "Great system well worth the money",
            "For a budget tablet it performs quite well but it's picture quality is not the best. I have tried juggling with the settings but still cannot get a decent screen display. \nThe sound is of poor quality but adequate for my needs.\nThe 32gb internal storage is brilliant plus a slot for a micro SD card to add external memory.",
