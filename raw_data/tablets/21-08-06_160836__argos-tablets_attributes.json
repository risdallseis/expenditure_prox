I just deleted the Huawei apps when finished setting it up.

It runs on the latest android version software. Plus I loved the fact that almost all the features are decent with the exception of the camera but that’s understandable considering it’s not an expensive tablet. Yes I fully recommend this product. It’s fast, elegant, has an amazing battery life & fast charging. Love it all.",
            "It is light weight and the battery life is good. I can watch quite a few videos without having the need to charge it. \nThe only thing is logging in. I had to do it twice before I can get in. ONCE would be better.\nI am happy with my purchase",

            "This is a great affordable tablet with 128GB storage and a sd card holder which will increase available storage. The 128GB allows for plenty of apps to be loaded and run. Youtube and other resource hungry apps appear to run very well. Also easy to set up and will link easliy to a wifi - it does NOT have the facility to run a sim card.\nReally happy with this tablet. Does exactly what I want. Good sized screen, great sound and good features.",

I have searched for something to use to read my mags and books but be able to do other things and have a big hard drive AND be Android like our phones.Finally, a manufacturer has seen sense and built one. Comes on in seconds, picture and coulrs are amazing and battery life is long. And its £300 cheaper than the Apple equivalent which I didnt want to but as I prefer Android to replicate all the apps I have on my phone. Problem solved. Its also got a micro SD to dump stuff to.",

            "Bought this to replace a previous model, the extra memory has made world of difference, worth every penny.",
            "Must be best tablet I have ever bought for the price, plenty of storage, great Full HD screen, loud for listening to music, but best bit is not full of useless apps which I would never use.",
            "After a lot of research decided on this for my daughter's birthday. She mainly wanted a piece of kit in size between her iPhone and laptop, portable enough for school and between friends for homework etc. This ticks all the right boxes and its memory for this price is a winner.

Easy to set up if you know what you're doing (obviously no useful instructions come with any tech these days!). It's great, and mum loves it :)",

            "This Lenovo M10 is sleek and stylish. It holds comfortably and is light weight. The screen is large and resolution is great. Images are clear with enough settings to change to suit. Face recognition lock is a nice feature although it can be difficult in poor lighting to unlock. With 4GB of RAM this tablet is fast with no lag. The sound quality is good I have watched movies using built in speakers and headphones with no complaints. Overall a good tablet only downside is no desktop mode.",
            "Looking for storage, graphics, and good processing power?\n\nWell this is your machine.... \nThe 10.3\" full HD screen is fantastic, never mind the front and back camera too! \n\nIt's got an octa core chip that can handle games and work stuff too!\n\nIt's durable and sturdy which, let's face it is great if the kids drop it... It lasts and battery lasts for ever!!!",
            "I was very pleased with this tablet indeed. I have mainly been using it for gaming and it's proved to be pretty fast. I like that it has added security steps such as facial recognition and it's very easy to use. The fact that my mum could use it definitely speaks to that! It's bigger than my last tablet but actually I quite liked the extra screen size as it meant that I could comfortably watch things on it without straining my eyes. Good sound and it's suitably loud for watching a film.",
            "The Lenovo M10 Plus tablet is a great tablet in my opinion. It runs on Android so if you have an android smart phone you can link it to your phone account. It’s lovely and slim, easy to hold and use. The screen is crystal clear and very responsive to touch, it rotates super quickly as well. The sound is ok, people who know more maybe able to adjust it to their liking? It attached really quickly to my Bluetooth headset. The battery life is very good depending on what you’re doing.",

            "The battery life on this is fantastic one charge and it lasts for 2 days with solid on and off use. \nThere is a already downloaded app called kids mode which is great. It’s set up with a passcode so you know they can’t get onto anything else and can play games within the app. It also has a timer which will turn the tablet into a freeze mode for a period of time that you can alter in settings. \nThe feel of the tablet is smooth and slim and the screen quality is fantastic camera is okay quality.",
            "One of the best things about this tablet is it holds it charge for ages! Another feature that I really like about this tablet is the screen, it is a really good size especially for playing games such as the sims or watching Netflix. The screen is also really clear. A useful feature is kids mode, allows you to give the tablet to children plus a password option means they can't go onto other apps In kids mode is has features such as colouring in. The tablet is also lightweight and easy to hold.",

            "This is a good mid range tablet. The picture quality and brightness is brilliant, much better than my samsung but is let down by the speed. It can take a while to catch up and buff when using netflix but once it has then it is fab.\nThe tablet charges up and and lasts a good few days if not using excessively.\nThe apps open quickly and work well.\nIt has a large memory and the ability to add more with sd card.\nOn the whole the tablet is good for basic everyday use. I would recommend this.",

Responsive touchscreen, fast processing.\n\nWhether I'm reading the news on the bigger screen or curling up with Netflix, this tablet is already my go to device. My only bugbear is that the screen collects fingerprints, but a lens cloth nearby handles that. Couldn't recommend more.",
            "This tablet has a lovely big screen and a great camera. It doesn’t come with instructions or a manual but they are available online if needed. You also need a google account to access google play and apps for the tablet as this is android device but it allows you to create one during the set up process which I thought was good!\n\nSturdy design, amazing colours and clear screen with loads of memory make this a great, value for money device suitable for any member of the family!

            "The tablet runs perfectly on Android. I am not a natural with technology but even I found it very easy to set up. It has a clear screen and good sound quality. I would a prefer a longer battery life bit it is not a major fault.\nI love the size, it is so slim. It slides in my handbag easily and weighs nothing at all. I would like a slim wallet type cover for it. I take it everywhere.\nMy favourite is the camera, as you will see from the attached pictures. They are so good.\nA good value tablet.",

It can be operated using face recognition which is a great safety feature and helpful for multi use. \nThe battery life surprised me as it’s very long. \nMy toddler loves exploring the kids mode which is full of fun monster activities including stories, nursery rhymes and interactive learning games. The position alert is another great feature to stop neck and back strain. This tablet is everything you need and more.",
            "The Lenovo M10 FHD Plus is a stunningly slim  tablet. The 10.3” display is very responsive to even the slightest touch and very durable when kids press on it heavily. When streaming there is little to no loading times and the HD IPS display makes your program more fun to watch as you can see even the minute details .Camera images are brought to life by the display.The powerful Octa Core Chip is the brains behind the tablet which allows the tablet to process so quickly and effortlessly.",
            "This tablet is a good size (10.3\") and light. Screen is HD sharp and sound/volume a good range even on live TV. 8mp rear, 5mp front camera takes photos well and videos are clear in picture and sound. Comes with fast charger and pin to open SD slot. A friend commented that my picture was clearer on Zoom with what I usually use. When initially switched on the instructions were easy to follow. Has facial recognition as well as password."
