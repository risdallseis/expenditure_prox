We had purchased the item due to the cost, and as we knew from previous experience- having had a similar tablet, that the new item would be reliable and easy for my dad to use. He is really pleased with it - as we are, especially as it was up and running very quickly.  The only issue we had was the mains plug that accompanied the tablet. As no where in the minimal instruction booklet accompanying the tablet, did it show that the three pin plug received, ‘opened’ up so as to fit the normal mains socket.  And I only discovered that it did open up when at a store trying to purchase one that would fit our socket. And the salesman kindly pointed out that the plug would expand to fit !!",

            "I'm very disappointed with this tablet. I \"upgraded\" from a working Samsung Tab A 10.1 (2016). Frankly it's a downgrade. The most important thing on a tablet is the quality of the screen. The A7 colours look completely washed out. Secondly the screen looked instantly dirty from unboxing. I don't know whether this is dirty screen effect or if it's a fingerprint magnet. Thirdly, and this was the biggest shock, the screen on my old Tab A 10.1 (2016) gets much brighter - approximately 100% brighter. I  can't read the A7 in bright sunlight like I can my old Tab A 10.1 (2016). The screen on my old Tab A 10.1 (2016) is better in every respect - it's far more colour accurate, it gets much brighter, it doesn't look dirty. The sound on the A7 is mediocre even with Dolby Atmos on - and that's being generous. I don't notice any difference in speed day to day despite the A7 having 1GB more RAM. In fact when I checked Device Maintenance on both tablets the A7 has less available RAM. In short - do not buy the A7 to replace a working Tab A 10.1 (2016). You will be disappointed.",

            "Like many other low budget Samsung devices you shouldn't have too high expertations,unless you don't wan't to get disapointed/ frustrated about all of the technical bugs etc.\nWhat's frustrating me too much is that this device have too many bugs/ errors in the script.\nLike that the device constantly have errors in the web browser ( such as  constantly close down; will go back to startmenu- not register new accounts on other web sites)( Note in Firefox), will neither have same support for many online webservices like protonmail.\nThis device is also incompatible with multitasking. So for an ex if I will look at a youtube or similar content in one window,and at the same time will do a google serach the device shuts down(pauses) the videoclip.\n\nI'm also frustrated about that my my device constantly ( a bug), wich explains why my web browser constantly shuts down.\nThis is realated to if you choose multiple languages. For an ex if you choose other than the factory set in wich country you bough the devivce in. In my case if you choose English instead of Swedish this will occure.\nAt the same time if you choose multiple languages the software will aut set up for the upcoming in the list.\n\nIt also frustrates me that the device \"flip function\" is too sensitive.\nIt can be enough for the sensor if I make a swipe gester over the screen.\n\nIt's also frustrating that the device is useless in bright sunlight.\nBoth that the screen gets completly black ( have turned the aut adaptive function off), but also that the screen is too shiny( too many reflections).But at the sametime if I'm inside in \"normal roomtemperaturre\" the screen works fine.\nNote that this is related to the newer models with Android 10 (2020)",
            "It does everything it says it does - decent internal storage. But it could sound and look better. Everything lags when you press something - higher end ones way better than this and I don't feel the reviews really focus on this enough. BUT you do get a lot of features for the money. It is a handy tablet and probably worth the money, but you'll thank yourself for waiting a bit a saving up for a better one.",
            "The storage on this tablet is really bad and only can download 8 apps and that is with no photos or videos. When you put in a sim card for this tablet it will not let you put apps onto it and only photos but even when I did I was only able to download 7 or 8 apps all together.\nReally do not recommend this tablet because what's the point if you have so little storage.",
            "Ordered and picked up within 30 minutes,  fast and safe service",
            "Only thing that lets the Galaxy tablet down is the fact that any inserted memory card cannot be used to store apps !",

            "Really easy to use!!",
            "Don't drop it! The slim and shiny body is not the easiest to hold but a case overcomes this.\nThe 3 Gb RAM helps to make this a fast tablet with an excellent screen. \nThe sound quality is surprising from such a small unit and the ability to add extra memory is a bonus.\nThe charging cable is a multipurpose USB Type C which is not the same as most phone/tablet charging cables.",

We have many other items connected to the Internet, all without issue, so this has been most disappointing. The Argos branch where I tried to return the tablet for a refund refused to do so because you are required to replicate the specific fault for which you are returning it. Poor service all round.",

            "Previously had an Amazon fire tablet, for the extra £40 this has multiple advantages and very few drawbacks.\nIt is significantly faster, has a base version of Android that is significantly up on the Fire and therefore the Apps are also newer versions than can be run on the Fire.\nOnly drawbacks so far is the apps cant be switched to the SD card and as a Barclays customer, their Banking app does not work , I suspect as it has no number associated with it being the wi-fi only version",

It quickly downloaded and setup everything I required automatically from my Google Account settings on the internet. I changed the defaults which Samsung use in these things compared with stock Android but it wasn't difficult.I only use this for emails, social media and internet searches, so have no idea if it's good for gaming.

            "Every year for the past 5 years I have purchased myself, my father and my mother the latest Samsung Galaxy Tab A model tablet as they are competitively priced and great quality devices. Samsung have always been a brand I have put my trust in. This year like usual I purchased three Samsung Galaxy Tab A7's for us all for Christmas. I wrapped my mother's and father's up for Christmas day and decided to open mine last night. I've never been so disappointed opening and using a Samsung product in my life. The screen is absolutely appalling on this model. It reminds me of the very first Amazon Kindle 7\" tablets. The brightness is rediculously weak, the viewing angles are rubbish and there's this really weird prominent blue tinge to the colour that you get with really inferior poor quality panels. Unless you are right Infront of the screen you might as well not bother. Can't really tell you about the performance as all three of these will be going straight back to where I bought them from and I think it's time that I started looking at other tablets from other manufacturers now. \n\nThe one thing on a tablet that should stand out is the screen. After all, this is going to be what you're going to be looking at all day over so if the screens rubbish you might aswell be holding a brick. Can't comment on performance as I couldn't be bothered using it with such a poor display. Compared it to my previous generation 2019 Tab A and I would say the display on the previous generation is twice as good as this. \n\nI've been a loyal Samsung customer now for many years but it seems as though Samsung have given up caring about its customers needs and instead would rather take shortcuts and use cheap low quality panels in their Tab A range to keep costs down. I've had a look online and there is so much competition now in this price bracket that I think it's time I went with a brand that doesn't cut corners like this.\n\nSo disappointed in Samsung that they think they can get away with producing such a shoddy machine. Please DO NOT BUY This model, the screen is absolute garbage!",

It's a nice device, great screen, a little heavy to hold in one hand after a while. I hoped that I could use an SD card to extend the capacity for apps but Samsung don't allow this and work arounds don't work on Android 10 as far as I can tell. Still 32gig will probably be ok",

My only complaint with this model is Samsung have removed a couple of features that were available on all my previous machines. I read the specifications before buying this model and it did mention that the file manager (My Files) does not give you access to your cloud account. You can use Google Drive but it was better using Samsung's My files. This is retrograde step that I was not expecting.",

            "The main reason I decided to purchase was that it has Widevine L1 meaning you can stream Netflix and Amazon Prime video in 1080p. Being newly released you should have plenty of future updates. Screen is ok but does have slight light bleed at the top of the screen when looking on dark background. Speakers are loud with good stereo seperation but no real bass.Battery life is good just a shame it only has 32gb storage and 3gb of ram which is low for a 2020 tablet at this price point.",

It's thin, sleek, responsive and has excellent screen brightness.  As I'm not a gamer, it would be difficult for me to say how this tablet will perform, but for routine use it's fantastic.  Updates quickly, easy to set up and the storage can be increased with an SD Card, runs on Android 10 and it just works.",
