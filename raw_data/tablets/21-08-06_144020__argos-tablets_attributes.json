            "It's irritating that they advertise this as 32gb as the operating system eats up a good 13gb; it means that useably without an SD card you end up with less than 20gb storage. That said for a cheap handy-sized tablet it's a good bit of kit. The screen can sometimes interpret where you rest your hand as input but you soon get used to it. It looks & feels great and on standby the battery lasts forever. Makes my Ipad pro look terribly overpriced! Recommended.",

            "This is a well-engineered tablet that is well-designed except for one major fault. The power button / on/off button is a small black protrusion on a matching black background. It is impossible to find for adults and children alike. Using the tablet requires manipulating it and feeling for the button. Terrible design. We have had to add some sticky tape to highlight the button. It is a shame as it is excellent in all other respects. Definitely not recommended for older users.",
            "This is as good as an ipad, went for 32gb as reviews on 16gb were that the memory wasn't big enough.\nSuper fast and runs so smoothly screen quality is second to none 10. 1\" is massive. \nThe eye comfort button is superb it really makes a difference (turns the blue light off that keeps you awake) would recomend for children.\nGoogle play works fine. \nGreat price from argos",

            "Very impressive tablet , very pleased with my purchase , bought it to replace tired Lenovo 10.1 I've had a few years , really pleased with the performance . Only downside is the placement of the speakers , they can be covered by your thumbs while holding it , not really that big a deal though .",
            "Tablet looks good and is fast with apps and online, however it took over 6-7 hours to charge everytime. After a few days of having a very disappointed little boy waiting for it to charge, I returned it for the Samsung Tab A 10.1. Argos were great.",

            "The tab is amazing left right and centre. However i am not impressed with the battery backup . The battery drains pretty fast while playing HD videos. \nAlso the charger output is pretty low for charging a 5100mah battery. A fast charger or high capacity charger should have been included",
            "Can't complaint so far, good quality, good screen, quite fast, so far so good.",
            "This tablet will do everything I wanted - the only issue I have you cannot alter the resolution so some applications are to big for the screen",

            "This tablet sits in the mid-range of the tablet spectrum, but I think it represents good value for money.\nPlus: \n- full HD screen suitable for all non-super fussy users,\n- good and loud speakers - plenty of volume for kids to watch while you driving,\n- good battery\n- the metal body gives you a bit of premium feel\nMinus:\n- the screen is a magnet for fingerprints.",
            "Worth of your money.",
            "Had this a couple of weeks now and have not managed to find no issues with it,\nIts fast and the screen is nice and sharp and the colors are nice a vibrant...... The battery is lasting about 10 hours so if your just using it for a few hours a day then a couple of charges a week will be all it needs,\nIts currently running on android 8 but after some reading up its due an update to android 9 very soon,\nWorth a buy if your after a nice spec tablet without a huge price tag.",
            "Good value for the price. Much better than expected, only issue is that you can't install apps on external storage I. E. Sd card.",
            "Works well. Good size.",

            "Thoroughly recommended for those who want good performance and decent amount of storage for lower cost. At this range you won't find a better tablet. The Samsung equivalent is the Tab A and this tablet completely out performs that tablet and others.",
