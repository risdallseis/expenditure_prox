But It is very slow when loading the kids profile (waited 20 mins for it to load the kids profile). I have to keep turning it off and on. If you have an impatient toddler, perhaps don't get this. Or just don't bother using the kids profile. Use normal (although that freezes also just not as much and as long as kids profile)",

I thought long and hard before purchasing due to personal opinions on devices like this for children but lockdown and various illnesses have left me clutching at straws for independent activities for the littles! I only took a star off because of the having to upgrade the operating system within hours of purchasing - it refused to download anything for a while and took a bit of time for me to figure out!",
            "Was torn whether to get these or not. Haven’t ever been a huge fan of tablets aimed at young children. However, with lockdown and various household illnesses, we have needed more independent activities for the boys to do. Of course they love puzzles, drawing, games etc but we wanted something else for the mix. The downloadable apps have suited their age group, their needs and it has been wonderful watching them work out puzzles and games on a screen. They’re learning as they do it too!",

            "The screen is quite small for him as he keeps coming back for my bigger tablet for a much more clearer picture. I can only use fewer applications on it that interest him. So, I guess I should have opted for something else.",

            "Bought at sale price as it was too good to turn down. My 3 year old loves watching YouTube kids videos and playing on my phone so it's great that he can now do all of it on his own device! Chunky and durable, and has plenty of educational games. Battery life isnt brilliant, but great if you only allow your child an hour or 2 at a time.",

For that purpose it is great, yes it is much slower to react than my own ipad but hey ho you get what you pay for.

            "Great product! I would recommend if your child is older and can navigate themselves. The only issue I have with it is that I can't lock the screen while watching. My toddler keeps touching and changing what she is watching in error, so I have to keep changing it back. The idea of buying this in the 1st place is to keep her busy so having to continuously reset what she is watching is a bit of a pain",

The battery lasts for ages. The case is really sturdy and would probably take a fair bit of abuse and given there is a 2 year free guarantee is fantastic. Amazon kids unlimited is quite frankly amazing. It's a great all in one purchase. Ideal for kids as there are a lot of learning apps.",
