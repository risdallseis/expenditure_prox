            "When first switched on wants you to sign up for Huawei account, no Google. I did not proceed any further but researched on the internet why no Google.\nFound out not available due to USA trade restrictions will not allow Huawei to use Google Playstore, and no chance of installing as Tablet blocks tries.\nAlso beware this is a WiFi only tablet.",
            "A brilliant little 10-1 tablet. \nI love the Huawei brand anyway & they've certainly not disappointed with this tablet, it's packed with loads of tech for it's mid range price, including the fingerprint & face recognition security, it's a really fast tablet & the battery life seems to last for ages. (Regardless of controversy with Huawei & the UK/USA at present) It's a fantastic bit of kit for the price & I definitely recommend it.",
            "High spec low price tablet.\nGreat sound. \nEasy to use. \nI am so glad i conisered this Huawei over Samsung and Apple over price and functionality.",
            "My new mediapad is great. I bought it to replace my broken ipad and is perfect for watching videos on YouTube, prime and Netflix etc. My son uses it for playing games like roblox and hello neighbour.\nIf you have a Microsoft 365 subscription like I have, you can pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and it's perfect for creating and completing documents whilst out and about. \nI bought the 64gb version and it's worth the extra, plus you can use sd memory cards and cloud storage for extra. Buy it!",
            "Looks Nice and sound is amazing we'll worth getting",
            "This tablet is sleek looks good is very quick and has a very good battery much better than my last one which was a Samsung .this huawei lite M5 which I bought is very good",
            "Huawei M5 media player is ideal for email and Web searches etc. It is also excellent at being a book reader and I have not put it down for long have read four books in the little time I have had it. Would recommend this product as a really good tablet.",

            "Great item the sound is the best I've ever heard from the 4 speaker system\nWorth buying just for the film music side of things\nI've run a lot of games haven't come across anything it has struggled with even when I switch graphics to max",
            "I bought this to replace my Amazon Fire HD 10 as I was having trouble using Android apps on it. This tablet boasts a faster processor (but still has 8 cores) and more RAM (a whopping 4GB) plus it has 64GB of storage with the ability to add a cheap SD card for more storage.\nThe tablet is fast and easy to use. It is also great on the battery life as with fair usage, I am only needing to charge it every three days or so.\nAll in all, a great bit of tech!",
            "Happy with the tablet but not fully satisfied.",
            "Superb Android tablet. Being used for commercial purposes with no problems.",
            "I bought it because it was recommended from some artists online to start learning approaching the digital drawing. \nI mainly bought it just for it and it's awesome: no lag, good response with the capacity pen I bought (waiting to receive the M-pen), no complaining so far.\nIf you can't afford a samsung tab or an ipad, this mediapad M5 it's a good compromise, even just buying Meko stylus which is cheaper than the M-pen.",
            "OK so buttons are in a weird place but other than that this tablet is great. Currently in use by both my children aged 9 and 6 - does everything then need from uploading school work to SeeSaw to playing Roblox and watching Netflix. Great sound quality and great picture quality. For the money I don't think there is a better tablet out there. Performes as well as our ipad air 2. There is also a great app for managing kids access, screen time etc.",
            "Top spec and performance is good too, does everything we wanted so why pay more for a Samsung or Apple iPad !!!\nRecommended !!!!",

            "Excellent product and worth the money",
            "Excellent value for money, fast and very clear",
            "Fantastic, exactly what I expected, does everything I need. Excellent sound and reasonable cameras for video calls. Would definitely recommend!",
            "Neat little tablet. Picture quality is very good. Excellent sound quality as it has 4 speakers. Runs on all apps.",
            "Although the battery life is very good, this tablet, meant for kids lacks the memory to smoothly one demanding games.",
            "This is the ideal size, works very quick very pleased with product.",
            "Brilliant Sound and Picture also Fast and Quick Charge  Thanks Argos",

            "Excellent tablet and well worth the money, a good rival to the much more expensive Samsung S5/6 and the Ipads.",
            "Absolutely Fantastic. Huawei is a brilliant tablet. So much better than the Samsung version I had before. Its fast and very responsive. The screen has an amazing display and the battery life is really good. Defo recommend 100%",
            "A superb tablet, great battery that lasts a long while for me, terrific performance for my uses but I don't play 3D games so can't comment on how it copes with those. The Google apps and services all work fine, I shall be sorry when Huawei products are no longer allowed to access Google. One small point to note is I believe this product only uses Android 8",
            "It's a good middle range product. A good substitute at home for my mobile phone in listening to music and digital radio as well as news reading. Four speakers with good sound quality. \n64GB version is recommended because it can reach 32GB very soon.",
            "Tablet great for space poor  sound volume from it sturdy tablet good for price at time not now should be more like 100 at most",
            "Fantastic, ordered and picked up next day.",
            "Very pleased with my purchase. Had already decided on this tablet, but confirmed my decision after reading the reviews. It's fast, lots of storage and expandable, lightweight and easy to use. The colours are sharp and clear and it takes acceptable photos. The only critism I would have, is that the on/off and volume buttons are at the bottom of the tablet, in portrait mode, which seems a bit odd to me and not that easy to control. Maybe better when I get used to them. Overall very happy.",
            "It is an excellent tablet. However, do not buy a case which is 10.1 or 10.8 inches as per the model's description as it is only 9.5 inches across. Apparently, the 10.8\" refers to the diagonal, but when buying a case it is measured horizontally left to right. I think the manufacturers for each should speak the same language.",
            "I love this tablet so far I have used it.... battery life is very good....",
            "I couldn't decide which one to get... Good job my brother has this tablet for the last 8 months and he totally recommended it to me. Very happy with the purchase.",
            "Only been using for little over a week. Only had to charge 3 times. Happy with that. Fast and responsive and the fingerprint security works a treat.",
            "Very good product. Beautiful screen with excellent touch control features.",
            "I like the look of the tablet. Its very sleek and has a good graphic. The only downfall is, its not for online gamers like me, which is the sole purpose of why i bought it. It lags sooooo much that you just want to turn it off. So disappointed as i canâ€™t  return it anymore. Shame.",
            "After some research I chose to give this tablet a try following the demise of my previous android tablet. The item arrived quickly and well packed. The tablet was discovered to be well made with a well engineered metal back. A improvement on its predecessor. On switching it on it was discovered to be easy to set up and the screen produced an excellent  colour and brightness level. The face recognition system works well in well lit conditions but has a tendency to struggle.",
            "Good specs in good price",
            "Excellent tablet good value and great performance",
            "Very pleased with this Huawei mediapad...it's faster than my ipad air...and looks really nice....",
            "Looks grate. Works good. Good colours and sound. All family likes it.",
            "After buying a few Tablets this one is the best. It has a nice, heavy feel to it like many 3 times the price. Fast with and excellent screen.\n\nWould buy it again.",
            "The tablet is exactly what the name says, a media tablet. Very nice screen for watching videos or browsing the Internet. It responds fast to commands and the normal day to day aps work just fine. Only if you want to play games with a lot of detail it will only play them on low res, like COD Mobile or Asphalt 9. Overall a really good tablet for the price.",
            "While significantly cheaper than a Samsung 5e the performance is pretty close to it. For a budget of Â£250 in the Android tablet market I think this is the best option.",
            "I think Huawei are the new apple, if you haven't tried a Huawei device then what are you waiting for because this performance is amazing and I'm very happy with my product.",
            "Slim Design, sharp colors.",
            "So far. No problems. Working very well. Much pleased with my purchase.",
            "Great product. Easy to set up. Easy to use.\nDoes everything I need at the fraction of the cost of a ipad. \nDelivery from argos same delivery was awesome also.",
            "I am very happy with this tablet so far. It has a very clear screen and is easy to use. It appears to be well constructed and the sound is quite adequate for me. I recommend this product.",
            "The tablet is amazing, it works great as a birthday present.  It has very good sound system and a lot of memory.",
            "Well impressed with it 4 speaker sounds great, it is fast on downloads plays the games with out a hitch, the display is nice and clear, deffinetly recommend it to anyone considering in buying this, it is worth the money",
            "Needed a fast tablet for viewing films etc and general day to day things. This tablet is fast. Very fast. There is no lag, or delay when using it. The size is excellent for viewing videos and it has 4 speakers which produce some great sound. I've played a few games on it and again it's superb. Can't really fault it to be honest. Very pleased with my purchase",
            "Very good and the sound is unbelievable.\nRecommended.",
            "Does the job, quick, colourful and light weight \nNeeds additional memory to be useful and nightly charging to last",
            "This pad is excellent it does exactly what I want the looks and build quality are great, it is a great alternative to a more expensive ipad.",
            "Had the Huawei M5 lite 64 gig for 2 weeks..very impressed..fast...easy to set up...suggest you consider the 64 gig model over the 32 gig as it has 4 gig of rom..a gig more...runs a tad faster and smoother...a great little mid price tablet...highly recommended",
            "Bought because I needed something to do college work on as my laptop broke, really good I have a Huawei p20 Pro and it is just like a big version of it, fingerprint scanner is quality at any angle. Screen very good definition and has a good amount of RAM to make it speedy for everything.",
            "This tablet is a great product ,looks really great with good sound volume but very difficult to hold as it is very slippery.\n\nIf you buy this you must get a cover or it won't be long before it slips out of your hands.",
            "Absolutely love this. Bought it as I have an Huawei phone. Great for storage, being a 64 gb. Picture is very sharp. Camera is fab. Tablet is very slim and light. Loads quite quickly too. All in all a great little android tablet. Would highly recommend.",
            "Bought the tablet as a gift as I was sick of replacing iPads for performance very impressed",
            "Boots up very quickly, screen is very clear and colours are very true."
