I have been able to set a timer on the device so that my child can only use it withing a specific time frame and I have been able to limit her usage to an hour. The device gives a 15 minute warning before the timer is up, which is really useful. It has had a few little drops but is still working perfectly fine. Overall, I am very pleased and my child is too! 5*",

            "Good product. I things best for kids",
            "The tablet/case is very step & practical for my toddler to use safely. It takes some getting used to how to add  things to her profile. My only complaint is that the home screen is too much for a young child, and I would have like more control over the display for this. For example the Home screen doesn't just have apps/books I have downloaded for her, but lots of suggestions which is too much for a very young child. She does enjoy using the tablet, but perhaps not as independently as i'd like",

            "Great price as matching amazon.",
            "Purchased this after my 3yo broke 3 iPads and I was impressed with the 2 year replacement guarantee.\nUnfortunately as he has used iPads this was too slow and none of the games he was used to from the App Store were available on Kindle.\nShould have got this to start with and not started him on the higher end tablets \nOverall it’s a great tablet just a bit slow.",
            "My kid loves the tablet and it comes with loads of games, videos and books. There are settings to control what a kid can see or play on the tablet as well as how much time they can spend on it.",
            "My daughter loves it, I’m not the most tech minded person so had to get my nephews Help with the apps and things but I watched a YouTube tutorial and can use it a lot easer now. Really good battery life. Definitely glad I got it when it was on offer though",
            "So easy to set up for a 6 year old to keep him safe. Change from kid setting to adult administration in a couple of clicks and back, you can leave them safely browsing away without worrying what they are up to.",

            "I love it.\n\nMaybe would love having hard cover for screen too",
            "Being used to iOS devices, we didn’t want to pay 3 or 4 times more than this for an ipad for our toddler due to it likely getting broken so went for this but compared to iOS it’s just awful to use. We have to watch YouTube videos to do any task on this thing it’s so clumsy to be able to do anything. Finally getting used to it after a couple of weeks but still I find it frustrating to use. I wouldn’t get another but the case is good and the warranty if it’s broken is a good thing for a kids toy",
            "Excellent for my 9 year old who.likes to play games. He can safely play with me knowing he cant go on anything thats not suitable!",
            "I wish I never bought it. I wish I was informed. I wish I could turn the the clock back. This is the most incomparable, most complicated device to use. Something for children should be easy to use. I bought two of them and tried to return them to Argos but was told they would not return it. They were one week old when I tried to return them in their original condition but was told that I can not return them. Waste of money. Will sell them.",
