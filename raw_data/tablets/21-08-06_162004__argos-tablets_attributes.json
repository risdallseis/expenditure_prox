So i'll keep this one to the usability.\nIn kids mode i don't like it, it has lots of games but you have to download everything and they are confusing between a book, game or video or youtube clip.  Much prefer the standard mode and download what apps you want, prime video can only be viewed via standard mode anyway, and alot of apps also only work in standard mode.",

These are for kids use so straight away location off, alexa off, weather off etc. I find the battery lasts just fine for kids having a few hours occasionally, and i try to remember to turn them off when not in use. Only takes seconds to reboot anyway and the kids could do with learning a bit of patience.",

Even at the far end of the house where my Wi-Fi is weak, it still runs better than my PC! The battery life is slightly disappointing, although still much better than a phone, but if you go into settings and choose low power mode (or simply reduce the brigntness) this helps significantly.",

So I took it in for an exchange and was giving a replacement in an opened box and the headphone socket isn't working on this one either. I know it's not the headphones at fault cause I tried a few pairs and they all work in my own tablet.
