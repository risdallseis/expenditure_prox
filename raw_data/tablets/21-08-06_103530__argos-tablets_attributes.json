However it is  much heavier and an indepth read reveals it is 400g plus- so be aware. It is also advertised as 16GB but in reality something like 9GB of internal apps and workings that cannot be removed- so you get only 7GB. I would strongly advise buying an SD card because 7GB is soon used up!",

            "The Huawei Media Pad T3 10 is an excellent tablet and is good value for money. \nBUT\nwith only 16Gb of internal storage and the fact that you cannot move your apps to a separate SD card means that its is severely limited and you run out of memory very fast which hugely impacts on performance. Most other Android phones and tablets allow you to move your apps to the SD card, this one does not. If I was to buy this again, I would get the model with at least 32Gb of internal storage.",

            "If you share your tablet withothers (i.e. the kids) do not buy this!  Huawei disable a stock Android feature, that being multiple accounts.  So if you set this up using your Google Account, that is it. Hand the tablet to the kids and they've got full access to read all your emails and complete access to everything.  On most Android based tablets there's the ability to switch users so multiple people can have their own separate users on a device, but Huawei have removed this ability.",

I have ended up giving it to my grandson as i cant use it for work like planned.",

I'm on a tight budget and now find myself having to buy a memory card,",

The speakers were screechy and buzzy at a medium high volume, completely unable to log into any websites (regular ones - shopping etc), smart lock was non existent, I was unable to login to Chrome to sync bookmarks etc, refused to let me use certain apps - Gmail, calendar etc saying I had to use another account! Utter rubbish, never using Huawei again -shocking experience.",
            "It's a reasonable tablet, up to date version of Android and plenty of RAM and CPU power for general use.  The screen is pretty good both for email/web and for watching video.\n\nThe downsides? (1 ) Huawei's implementation of Android doesn't allow moving apps to the SD card and coupled with (2) the OS using up about half of the memory, this will run out of space for apps much sooner than I'd like it to.  However, at the price, it's not bad.",

It is smart, quite light, has a very good screen and runs smoothly. A flight sim game is perfectly playable, and emails/ documents all fly along. In summary, it meets all my needs, at a fraction of the price of the mainstream tabs. A Great Bargain!",
            "Bought one for a gift. Was so impressed I bought another. Very good for the price, and not full of extra app clutter.",

            "Looked at many tablets before I settled on this one. Quality is as good if not better than similar brand tablets. Runs Android making it easy to use  For the build quality and price you can't do much better.",
            "Great product works fantastic in everyway sturdy reliable fast very responsive just a all round fantastic tablet can not believe how cheap it was it's worth a lot more money it's a bargain if your looking for the best tablet at the best price this is it! Highly recommend it! :)",
            "Very pleased with the tablet, bought it for my little boy to replace an older one. It is a bit smaller than 10'' but much lighter and solid (Aluminium) so just perfect for my kid",
            "Does everything it says, much cheaper than it's rivals but still performs just as well",
            "Slim, good looking tablet. Glass shows every fingermark, I will be using  a stylus. My one criticism is that there are no set up instructions, just a tiny picture of the exterior of the tablet and it's edges, stating what the switches and ports are for.  Wanted to download some instructions but not available on internet.",
            "Bought these for our Children’s Christmas. Budget friendly, good picture and sound. Both children needed an upgrade from their ageing tablets. The batter life is fantastic when either watching videos or playing games. Tend to charge over night so can’t comment on charging times. Easy to set up and download apps.",

            "I bought this as a replacement for my partner, everything is working great, battery is good also would recommend to anyone",
            "I was looking for a sleek tablet to replace my much older, tireder (?) and bulkier one.\nI looked at and compared what was on offer from Argos and by narrowing down the option of RAM, internal and external storage, screen size, weight and so on that I knew about but am by no means professional on and decided this was the best tablet for me. \nWhilst the 16GB internal storage gets used up quickly with apps (I guess I could remove many I rarely use) the 64GB external SD storage is excellent.",
            "Would recommend this product to every one do the same as and Apple",

It seems a lot more responsive than my old one, the screen is crystal clear and battery life seems excellent so far.",
            "Probably a great tablet for someone looking for a horizontal tablet.I wanted the same one that is depicted in catalogue which is quite clearly vertical.Dissappointed really.H.Fyfe.",
            "Tablet looks good and feels solid. Was simple and easy to set up. Instructions clear and concise. Screen is large and vibrant, excellent viewing angles. Small speaker at base of tablet is functional, not very loud ,does not distort when at full volume. Ear phone connection improves sound volume. Apps can be laid out in alphabetical order so really easy to find. Plenty of preloaded apps like face book. Build quality acceptable. Overall a good and usable tablet.",
            "We got this tablet for our daughter and it's the second Huawei tablet we have owned, functionality is great much like most android devices. The battery lasts as good length of time normally most of the day with the kids playing it on and off, it does however take a while to charge.  Sound is ok as you would expect and the product has great build quality and design. All in all a good tablet and on par with others costing more money.",
            "Having read the reviews in ARGOS I simply had to get one as it sounded very good and upon opening I realized that this was in fact an excellent purchase",
            "I found the Huawei MediaPad tablet to be an excellent product. The size & weight make it portable but also large enough to enjoy watching movies. The graphics/sound quality were great, and there's an excellent range of apps available. Used by myself for personal & business use but also my 5 year old daughter it offers everything for us both. Front & rear cameras, wifi, bluetooth, speaker, headphone jack, memory card slot, microphone and excellent battery life complete this superb tablet.",
            "Couldn’t wait to open and see the contents. Tablet came with a 77% charge already for me.\n\nQuick and easy instructions on set up meant I was able to be up and running in less than 5 minutes and surfing the web.\n\nI was immediately struck with the quality of the large screen which is flawless.\n\nThe front and rear camera are brilliant with picture quality outstanding.\n\nA really good 10” tablet which is easy to navigate with every feature imaginable.",
            "Really easy to set up. Connected to my Google account and all of my phones apps & games were also transferred over. It has enough memory to download all your favourite apps and games. The battery life is awesome. Charged it to 100% over a week ago and its still half full. Decent size screen to watch YouTube with good quality images. Front and rear cameras are nothing to scream about, but do the job just fine. Good build quality, nice and sleek. Would definitely recommend.",
            "The tablet is very slim and has a metal case and this makes it light weight, from when it arrived to using it took me around 10 minutes this was helped by the fact I have a Google account already but I don't think it would take much longer. The screen is bright and clear and ideal for working or entertainment in particular as this is a media tablet. The sound quality is on par with others and also comes with headphones socket or you can connect your Bluetooth headphones as I did to watch Netflix",
            "Works well I could do a longer battery life",
            "Really good tablet. Lovely graphics and really easy to use.. Love it!!",

            "Love this tablet. It does everything I want it to. It is fast too. This is the 5th tablet I bought. The other 4 were all faulty and were returned. This one easily beats the competition in its price range.",
            "My Huawei mediapad T3 is a fantastic tablet , it is very responsive with sharp and very clear graphics. Having 16gb of storage is great but having a micro SD card slot to expand the storage is even better . Only being 10 inches in size makes it easy to carry around , it is an ideal tablet for young and old as it is  very easy to setup , both front and rear cameras take extremely clear photographs . The Huawei mediapad T3 10 is one tablet I would highly recommend.",
            "The quality of the tablet was very good but there seemed to be a problem with the battery life so I returned it for a refund.",
            "This tablet is really good , it’s not a 10” more like 9” but it’s still worth it, very happy with purchase , highly recommend",
            "I've seen the name Huawei on mobile phones but not familiar with the brand, after opening the box first impressions were excellent very nice aluminium backing gives it a high end feel, The tablet is excellent to use fast easy and responsive running on the latest version of Android , for the price I was very surprised, I was replacing a ageing slowing branded model, this is a great priced tablet\nYes, I recommend this product.",
            "one of the best tablets i have had for a long timr",
            "This mediapad t3 10 inch tablet looks great but performs better the sound is crisp and performs well watching tv, movies and football. Copes very well with games with a responsive screen for touch games. Easy setup, did not encountered any issues and set up in minutes. Battery life is very good. For the price it competes well if not better than high end tablets. Even though it's 16gb it only has just over 7gb free space but you can put in a sd card to boost space. Camera is decent",
            "Apps can't be moved to SD card. Storage is not sufficient for my needs.",
            "Great build quality and very fast running, love it.",
            "Bought this for hubby who has sight problems as it is a good screen size.  Appearance very sleek n nice looking. Easy to set up and use. Well worth the price.",
            "I bought this tablet as a replacement, and the key features I wanted were larger screen a day bigger memory. This Huawei tablet has both at a very reasonable price. I bought it Bason the reviews on the Argos site, and am very pleased with it so far. The only downside is that it's a little heavy to carry in my bag.",
            "This is a great tablet for  the price. It doesn't have the greatest screen resolution, but it's okay. It replaced a more expensive tablet and matches that well",
            "This to replace my wife's aging tablet, she is very pleased with the speed of startup and response, still learning all the various software/apps. Easy transfer of apps from old to new tablet. Excellent price.",
            "Found the screen very responsive and after using a 7inch screen so much easier to use. Setting up for first use was easy really enjoy using it.",
            "Great service and device though the screen size, listed, is a bit vague.",
            "Great tablet at very reasonable price. Would definitely recommend.",
            "Huawei tablet is good for personal use, sleek and light enough to carry in my bag. The OS is simple to use and runs smoothly.",
            "Excellent tablet for the price, good quality and well built. Nice looking, slim and lightweight with a lovely bright and clear screen, colours are good too. Sound is good and loud enough for just one speaker. Great for Web browsing, watching videos and good for most games. Tablet runs very smoothly with Huawei's EMUI and Android 7 Nougat and some very useful Huawei apps.   Good battery life, charging takes about 3 and a half hours. Good camera's. A great quality tablet for all ages.",
            "Excellent for the price. I would buy it again. Battery life is surprisingly good - it lasts all day. \nThe speaker could be a little bit louder and better quality also it is placed at the bottom so it is easy to cover it while holding the device on laps.",
            "Says it's a 10 inch screen size 9..2 is the correct size",
            "A value for money product that is easy to use & with very good value battery life. I use this for field use in my work & would definitely recommend it",

            "Excellent value for money, very happy with my purchase.",
            "The battery takes hours to charge fully. The tablet is on the heavy side. Actual performance is no better than my old tablet, just slightly faster at loading up. Once I had put my music and photos on the memory was pretty full.\nIt does what it is supposed to but paid more so expected more than my old one.\nDisappointed and wish I had not bothered.",
            "Bought this for my wife, to replace her smaller tablet. Disappointed because the pictures were not as sharp as we hoped and the colours were not as good either.",
            "My wife's nexus died after three years, this seemed like a good replacement with bigger screen and longer battery life. She is very pleased with it, nice sharp screen and good sound .I thought they had provided the wrong charger at first, as it wouldn't fit a standard 3 pin socket, but if you look carefully at the plastic earth pin it is inscribed up, with an arrow pointing up, Put your finger under it and it lifts up out of the body into place and then fits the socket .",
            "I have returned this tablet and replaced it with Samsung Tab A 10.1. Actually nothing was wrong with it but I prefer our favourite brand 'Samsung' ... more reliable.",
            "Good price for a well designed piece of kit. My mum has settled right into it and can access everything she wants. The picture is clear and the colours are good. Loading and shutting down is super fast and apps work quickly.",
            "This is a 'does what it say's on the tin' product. You get a lot of' bang for your buck' too compared to other makes.",
            "The tablet is very light, easy to use and looks fab. Very light to carry around. Well worth the money."
