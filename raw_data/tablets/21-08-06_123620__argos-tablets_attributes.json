It's faster than most Android tablets, has a good clear 10 inch screen and fast charges in hours. No need to spend a fortune on buying a new tablet when this one has all you'll need.\n\nIt also has Bluetooth capability.\n\nA power supply is also included in the box or you can just use any power supply and plug it into the USB-C port.\n\nVery happy to recommend.",

We bought this for a kid who uses tablets almost exclusively to watch youtube. This should be made more obvious! Luckily there was a 3rd party app which solved the issue, but I wouldn't buy a Fire again.",

            "Lovely tablet does all that it should",
            "I honestly can’t believe they don’t charge more for it, it’s quick, clear screen, smooth actions, a real little pocket rocket, it’s a cracking little unit. Im super impressed with it, when I’m not using it directly it is set up in the lounge and acts as another Alexa device for anyone to use for music, phone calls etc. The show mode is a great feature.",

            "I thought I was getting a normal working but not probably as good as an ipad tablet, it's totally biased and targeted towards amazon, you can't get Google play or Gmail, it's also very slow and laggy and keeps freezing, it's really just an extension of the Amazon market place, OK u can use it as a reader and that's its only saving grace, in essence I see this as a glorified Kindle reader, Had I not purchased a case for it I would have returned",

As a long time Fire user I knew what to expect from it, my only gripe is that Amazon have changed the charging port so that other Fire chargers do not fit this one and vice versa.

            "These are such a good deal better than our iPad for kids. After setting up the kid safe section (1 hour) you can give it to any child with the knowledge they can’t get into trouble.\nYou can load google AppStore if you follow instructions online but be aware that any downloaded app from it can’t be used in the kids safe area.\nKids YouTube is missing from the kids section but normal YouTube can be toned down.\nI couldn’t get one from amazon but amazingly they were in stock for same day delivery.",
            "My son loves it for his work",
            "This machine comes at a great price for the size and capabilities.  I'm used to an ipad but I love my new Amazon Fire.  The only downer that I can think of is that it is much heavier than the ipad but then again it also has a bigger screen so you can't have everything.",
            "I bought the Fire HD 10 for my wife as a consequence of our two little ones claiming her previous Fire HD 8 for themselves.\n\nThe display is extremely clean and responsive built with Amazon's bespoke Android variant. For advanced users a lot of effort has to be put in for adding Google Play or non-Amazon approved applications. \n\nFor general users though it's perfect for watching streamed content (Disney+, Netflix et al) as well as web browsing and social media.\n\nHappy Wife, Happy Life!",
            "For the money it’s good, the fact that it isn’t fully android and doesn’t like google can be worked around making it a great tablet for day to day use",
            "This is a replacement for my previous tablet, also an Amazon Fire. Easy to set up and transferred all my data and apps with one touch. Better than the previous one as had updated features. Great tablet if you don't want the expense of an iPad.",

            "When I buy I expect free title and be restricted in the use OF MY tablet by the manufacturer.\nThe first thing the seller and manufactuer should say is in all advertising is that 'You cannot just use this product without committing to other services first'. The seller did not say that. It may be in their terms but major matters as these should be plainly and visibly shown. \n \nConsequently it being returned",

Overall so far I'm very happy with it.",
            "Love the tablet as it's a great size for me to watch netflix, its light weight and feels easy to brake but would recomend buying a case and tempered glass screen protector as soon as you can, battery life is good, sometimes the tablet slows down when you have too much going on in the background. Apart from all that it's perfect and portable and great screen size for anyone who likes to stream their shows etc...",

            "Very good tablet. Worth the price.",
            "With lockdown and my holiday being cancelled I decided to treat myself to a much needed new tablet. This is everything I wanted from it and the price is half what you’d pay for something similar from some of the more established tablet manufacturers.",
            "Bought for my 3yr old as thought it could grow with her rather than buying the tablet specified for kids. Easy to use and able to put any limits/restrictions on. Only downside slightly is the battery life.",

            "This is the fourth Fire HD tablet that I've bought over the past few years - this time I needed to update to an operating system that was compatible with the latest Sonos app.\n\nI opted for the 10 as I have a monthly account with Readly and until yesterday an introductory deal with The Times and the screen size is perfect for reading magazines and broadsheets.\n\nThe video capability is excellent, no lag problems watching the latest Jack Ryan series in the garden on lockdown.",
            "Although we have not used the tablet yet I have checked it to make sure it’s in working order. My sons birthday is on Easter Monday and I am confident he will love it.",
            "It does what it's supposed to do. I bought it to replace a 7 inch  fire which I've had for 7 years and is still fine but didn't have a camera. I decided to upgrade .I'm not keen on all the icons on screen but I'm sure I will get used to it. It is annoying I can't get now tv on it but a small thing.",
            "It's great if all you want it for is watching stuff. As it's Amazon it won't allow you to download hardly any apps as their own store is tiny & their own browser is very poor.\nIt's already gone back",

Fantastic buy at that price !...",

            "Having previously owned a Fire tablet, I thought that I wouldn't buy another, but the reviews for this one changed my mind.  The only downside is, as before all the Amazon products and apps that are pushed.  By doing various Google searches I was able get rid of all the unwanted features.  I don't use it for games or films, so can't say how it performs for those, but it certainly does all that I need.\n Opening the genuine Fire case, wakes the tablet and  closing it, iputs the tablet to sleep",
            "Got the tablet for a reasonable price, although was looking to buy another and they have increased the price even though it wasn't on offer when I brought it.\n\nBut aside from that, I got this as my daughters fire 7 had stopped working. And it's much better than the 7. The screen is so much bigger and the battery life lasts alot longer. It seems to be quicker also.\n\nOnly downside is it on has select apps which is a shame would be such a better option if it had the play store downloaded on it.",

            "This is a good tablet, very good speakers and clear screen, setting up was quick and easy. The fire 10 depends heavily on Amazons software and does not have access to  the huge number of apps other android tablets have. I use this tablet to read books on and for social media and news, I find this tablet excellent for what I want it for and would certainly recommend it particularly if you are an Amazon customer.",

It really is much faster, & the larger screen is even sharper.\nWould recommend installing the Google Play Store, as the Amazon store lack some important Apps.\nFor the price, It's one of the best tablets available.  Feels solid, and oozes quality.",

            "This tablet is great for multi media. It is a fraction of the price of other big brands.  The Fire tablet is not as pleasing to look at as some other high end tablets but given it is a fraction of the price, it's plastic look can be forgiven.  Great all rounder, and well worth the money.",

The android system is unique to Amazon and takes a little getting used to if you have used an android tablet before.

Great screen - size and colour excellent for viewing content. Just remember, Fire tablets run a forked version of Android - everything is geared towards getting you to buy from Amazon. As a result, Google services are missing (but can be installed easily with a bit of know how) so keep that in mind. Otherwise great value, especially on sale.",
