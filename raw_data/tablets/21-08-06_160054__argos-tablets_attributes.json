            "I have used Lenovo tablets before and they were great but this one is sadly not.  Firstly it takes a while to boot up and be ready for use, about a minute plus, far longer then my old Tab 10.  The UI and navigation gestures are a nightmare, the standard bottom of the screen navigation buttons are replaced by sliding your finger in various locations on the screen to go back or move to home screen, I found myself in many occasions scrolling down a page of text to suddenly going back to the previous screen.\nOn the plus side the screen is great with HD and the Dolby Atmos speakers are excellent.\nThis tablet could be much better if they fixed the navigation gestures.",

One drawback is the battery capacity. It is maximum 4-6hrs of display time. Need to be bit mindful when you choose this device for online classes. All together it is worth for the price.",

The speakers are good and can be loud enough to hear soft sounds. Recommend to get a cover for it as might break if dropped. Luckily the on and off is short, as the battery life in a standby mode seems to eat power.",

Not as fluent as an apple product when powering up or switching between programmes/apps but perfect for what I’ve purchased it for; keeping the children entertained. I spent ages trying to find the right tablet for them. This plays CBeebies app, Minecraft and Netflix and the likes no issues. You can also control their limits for individual apps or overall time via your own phone. Cases can be bought for it from 3rd party suppliers for around £10.",
            "Like the lightness of this one, compared to my previous, 3yr old,  Lenovo tab.\nVery touch sensative, clear, sharp screen.\nI play games and watch a lot of tv on it. \nThe battery, so far, lasts ages.\nAlso like the improved charger point. Seems much stonger  than earlier models.\nI can't think of any negative about this ⅕",

I have searched for something to use to read my mags and books but be able to do other things and have a big hard drive AND be Android like our phones.Finally, a manufacturer has seen sense and built one. Comes on in seconds, picture and coulrs are amazing and battery life is long. And its £300 cheaper than the Apple equivalent which I didnt want to but as I prefer Android to replicate all the apps I have on my phone. Problem solved. Its also got a micro SD to dump stuff to.",
            "Pros : good quality, well built metallic like case.\nGreat screen quality and ok sound\nBattery life is good on the right settings\nPlenty of power for most apps and games\nCons: quite thin and the screen takes up almost all the front of the tablet, can be a pain when holding it\nBattery gets a pummeling of you change the screen settings to watch films etc\n\nI would recommend it though, and would get again. Hint: get a decent case up front, helps with handling",

            "It was a lovely purchase, easy and quick delivery, dangerously smooth transaction (as in, sometimes I wish it was a bit harder to spend my money). But this little one is totally worth it, it is nice size, albeit a little heavier than I thought - but I assume that adds to the very nice battery life. The screen and images are pretty, and although I haven't been using for much more than a month, I'm happy with the speed.",

            "Easy to set up and use. Lightweight with a clear screen.",
            "Just what I was after. We'd had a Lenovo before and when it broke (son stood on it) we sought to get a similar one as a replacement. This one is slightly better as it's a much newer model but also a bit bigger. Got the folio case at the same time which makes it much easier to use.",
            "Tab M10 FHD Plus 2nd Gen love the newer gen runs fast no lagging great features very clear screen great sound nice size and battery life is great",
            "There is a nice feel to the tablet, weight is just right. No trouble with set up, just as you would expect from an Android device. Not hindered by any additional applications as with some other well known names.",
            "It works. Decent screen. Quick.  What more can be said.",
            "For an essentially budget price tablet compared to the high price branded ones this is an amazing buy. Very good quality, large and useable screen size. The tablet performs very well and I haven’t suffered any lagging or delay on anything I’ve put it through. Absolutely brilliant tablet that I highly recommend",
            "The M10 FHD Plus is a great tablet it does everything I want from a tablet. Best one yet",
            "Excellent device for the price, just what i wanted",
            "tablet takes about 4 hours to charge. Approx usage 36hrs and 50% battery left. Slow to turn on and open. Keyboard well spaced easy to use and navigate. Settings and apps easy to control.Good quality picture for videos/ tv shows no lagging or long loading. Sound better and less tinny with videos rather than music. Good sound but tinny at full volume especially if bass is heavy. Back camera blurry even in good light, front camera better but still not great. Overall a good all purpose tablet.",
            "I found the tablet very basic, was disappointed it wasn't on Android version 10 yet. It has all the usual basic apps but you do have the Google play store to download so you can add your apps that you want. The screen and graphics seemed good for what it was. My personal opinion is that it is ok for children or people who are not very technical as it would be more suitable for them due to the easy setup which took me literally a minute and very easy for their basic needs",
            "Had a few issues with setting up but got there in the end. Nice size screen for any work and the screen quality is good. The front and back cameras are very good quality. The menu navigation is not very responsive or intuitive though, but this doesn’t carry through once you have an app open. Good size storage and access to all the android apps. Nice slimline design and lightweight. Sound quality is as good as any other tablet brand we have had. Has a 3.5 mm headphone jack which is useful.",
            "I absolutely love the design of this tablet, it's so lightweight and easy to slip it into a handbag or backpack for when you are on the move due to the slim design. The battery life is insanely good, it lasts me for days without needing another charge. Would definitely recommend.",
            "Wow This tablet really is so stylish.i am so impressed with the display the colours are really bright.its really easy to access everything on the tablet,Easy to export my apps from my android account,the battery life is really good too.my kids have enjoyed playing on the kids apps and I’ve been on my usual apps,we all think it’s the best tablet we've had,I’ve been taking lots of pictures to upload to my social media and the camera is really good,I’ve printed a few off and the quality is amazing.",
            "Excellent tablet. Great screen size, brilliant for watching a movie, being online etc. Really easy to set up and use. Nice clear screen with good sound quality. Website pages load quickly and it has plenty of storage for documents, photos and apps. Fantastic addition to our household. Would highly recommend this product.",
            "I'm really impressed with the Lenovo M10+. It was really easy to setup and I could easily import all my favourite settings and apps from my Google account. It's really slimline and looks smart with it's metal chassis. The screen colours are really vibrant. I have been using it for hours daily and I get a full two days use on one charge. I fully recommend it!",
            "The Lenovo M10 is an excellent tablet, with a nice size screen and a really clear display. Setting up with your Google account was extremely simple, and integrated with my accounts within a few moments. Sound quality is surprisingly good, and apps run well. Photos look amazing on the display. Updates were simple and no bother. I did notice occasional lag with some apps when dragging, and occasionally when scrolling through pages, but it wasn't all the time. Overall though, highly recommended.",
            "This is a must have for all the family to use, there is a built in kids pack so they are safe online, Dolby Audio Dual front facing speakers great for watching movies and gaming.Various ways of unlocking the pad including face recognition, preloaded with Android 9 a slot for micro sd card front and back facing camera which take great pictures.I found apps from the playstore were very fast to download and install. all in all its a great entertainment pad that will keep all the family happy",
            "A great little tablet. I am not tech savi and will admit it took me a few attempts to set this up but once done l was good to go. I admit it was difficult to set up. The tablet Is chunky compared to my usual one but the graphics are good and I am pleased with the picture quality. The battery life is good and I find it easy to use. I like the build quality. It feels sturdy but would advise buying a case to keep it safe. Overall a great price of well priced kit once you have overcome the set up.",
            "A very nice looking tablet & very thin, though i thought a tad on the heavy side, a nice size screen at 10.3 bigger than most. With H.D resolution with 1920x1200 pixels it takes great colour pictures, also great for youtube and skype, very easy to set up and find things, battery life is very good at around 14hrs normal use, less though if your on youtube, only down side is netflix won't work in HD, apart from that great for office work a good all rounder.",
            "This is the first Android tablet I have owned and have previously been wedded to my IPad, but was pleasantly surprised by the Lenovo. I’ve had it a week and found it easy to navigate and quick to respond. I like the wide screen and the picture quality is great. A little bit heavy compared with an IPad, but not enough to put me off. Overall it feels solid and well made. I would recommend this product.",
            "I never expect much from tablets, but this one has exceeded my expectations. First of all, it looks great, the screen is a good size at 10\n3\", and the picture quality itself is more on par of a laptop than any tablet I've previously used. When first turning it on, I was able to link it to my google account which allowed me to access any apps I already have installed on my Google account. The set up was extremely easy to do, and quick. The battery life on this is great.",
            "Really stylish tablet, its nice and compact. This tablet is very easy to use. Has some great features and brilliant camera. Holds the charge really well. The only down side for me is i cant change the fonts on this tablet its set to only one style. But over all an amazing tablet and highly recommend",
            "This is one of the most user friendly , responsive tablets I have ever had . The functionality is very similar to a phone and has an easy set up . The display is high quality especially on the large screen and there is no lagging from your touch. The sound is crystal clear and allows smooth listening of music and videos. Bit of a con is it is a bit heavy which can be annoying after a while of holding it , and as it has a metal back initially it is cold,  easily resolved with a case.",
            "This tablet is well built with metal case and feels good in hand. Great screen colours when streaming but sound lacking. Surfing feels snappy although reaction to input sluggish. This will not play games with action very well and stutters with content rich games. It is adequate for young family use for internet and media, external storage and case advisable. Google docs work well as long as not to many apps open at once. Quality tablet but lacking in abilities.",
            "A lovely crisp 1920 x 1200 display and surprisingly good audio using two speakers.\nA quick start guide, ‘First Time’ app and a 'TIPS' app gets you quickly up and running. \nVideo, streaming, surfing and apps have performed as they should, it has 2GB of RAM. 32GB storage + option for a SD Card. USB C connection.\nIndividual family profiles, Kids mode, facial recognition & good battery life.\nI would advise a case for viewing and protection.",
            "I am so impressed with this. From opening the box there is minimal wasted packaging. Simply take out if the box, charge and go. Its android which i am familiar with. The screen fills so no wasted borders. The screen is so clear and crisp. Good quality camera and some nice features. Very lightweight. The battery lasts for a long time. The sound quality is fantastic so watching a film in bed has become the new craze in my house. All in all this is a fantastic tablet.",
            "I love the opticore chip \nInternet works very fast and quick response time. \nIt looks stylish and easy to handle. \nThis is are first time using a lenovo product and I'm impressed the only thing I would say as a down side is the 8mp camera still does the job as shown in pictures. I will be recommending to others,\nGreat for game play, video's and music"
