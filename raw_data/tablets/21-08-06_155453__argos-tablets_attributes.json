The tablet I received does not have any USB ports. I did raise a question on the website regarding to this but still haven't had a reply. I have checked the website again today and it now states in the spec. that the tablet comes with 2 x 2.0 USB. Either I have the wrong tablet or the spec is wrong.",

It is fast, very fast, easy to set up and use, with a generous size memory and a good size ram. Great for most basic surfing and online games. I am no good with specification and figures but I have now bought 3 of these so our family can keep in touch online. Vital in the current time.",

            "The display, speed at which the tablet processes and its charge are all proving to be highly efficient and the tablet is very light, even compared to other tablets that are the same size",
            "This tablet is okay for simple tasks but does not cope well with large amounts of data (e.g. video call) and can generally be a bit slow. My mobile phone is better in that regard. However, it was purchased for homeschooling purposes and it is sufficient for that.",

            "Be patient! Takes a while to update things and may seem slow at first. However, once everything is updated, it works a treat.",
            "Great price for what it is needed for. Bought fir my elderly mother for facebook and playing games. A much cheaper option than paying over £200 for a Samsung 10inch. This 10 inch is perfect for my Mum.",
            "Brilliant large tablet, it was a Christmas gift for my mother who isn’t very tech savvy but she’s got along great with this tablet, it was an upgrade from a 7 inch and she prefers the much larger screen, runs very well, great purchase.",
            "Does exactly what you would expect first social media games.\n\nnot the first but it's a nice chunky design so you get a firm hold simple I use it for my child so it's quite durable without any cases .\nQuality of the screen is very good I personally was expecting a rubbish screen for something for this price but it's just add responsive as big-name brands .\n\nDoesn't slow down providing you clear your apps and don't leave them all open.\n\nI'm comparing this to a Samsung S7",
            "Fantastic tablets great price and very easy to use my hubby was chuffed with it",
            "I bought this tablet to ease up on the amount of apps on my phone. I have been pleasantly surprised to be fair. It was good for team and zoom app meetings. It is good for video and film watching. It is a little heavy so not great for arthritis users or people with muscle weakness. It takes good pictures. But it takes an age to charge and the battery does not last long before needing recharging. Great for a childs first interaction with technology as it is intuitive. Battery use lost it a star.",
            "This is a great product its easy to set up and navigate the apps screen size is great and good quality sound would recommend it",

            "Bought 2 for my boys (both under 10) as they had outgrown their 7 inch tablets. These were perfect, priced so that if they get broken i wont be too heartbroken at an eye-watering replacement price. You get what you pay for though, dont expect lightening speed processing or huge memory. Its entry level, cheap and cheerful and perfect for two young and clumsy children.",
            "Good product does what it says on the package\nDidn’t receive my nectar points though",
            "Brilliant budget tablet, does nearly everything my computer does. However do not expect miracles from this unit.",
            "Looks good but performance is bad very slow between Windows",
            "Bought this for my son but he wasn't happy with it at all. It keeps disconnecting from the WiFi & was getting stuck on YouTube. Ended up buying him another brand and am now using this one myself. It's ok for looking at FB & emails but still keeps disconnecting from WiFi.  Battery life is poor and takes a very long time to charge. Left it on a charger overnight, it still wasn't fully charged! Don't recommend.",
            "Simple,easy to use,great basics for my son's education",
            "Great device, easy to set up and image great quality.",
            "I usually have Samsung Tablets but thought I'd have a change and this was alot cheaper and with more memory. The tablet looks nice and sleek slim in design picture/video/screen quality is very good. Down load speed is very good and flipping from screen to screen is good. It is on par with a Samsung tablet. My only niggle is the tablet does take a while to charge up but once charged it holds its charge for quite a long time depending on your use.",
            "+ light. good battery life. good sound.",
            "Bought as Xmas present for my husband who is not very IT literate. Set it up for him, he is over the moon with it so easy to read, very clear screen and soon got use to using it. He is in his 70s !! Goes on it every day.",

            "I love the size of my tablet",
            "It boots up really quickly and does a system update, so far so good. Downhill from this point. Battery life is not good, the main culprits being the bluetooth and location on all the time, they eat battery time. Real shame because it looks good and is responsive for a two year old design. Buy one as a first or standby tablet, just be aware of its limitations, it's not an iPad substitute ☹",
            "Got this for granddaughter,  she loves going on you tube and getting educational videos",
            "Excellent quality tablet, it's works great, strong and has a great screen. It is very quick and very simple to use and has USB-C so it fast charges. The memory is small but I fitted a 64gb card without any issues.\n\nThe battery lasts approximately 5hrs of constant streaming Netflix at half the brightness level so is pretty good, it wasn't flat at the time either!",
