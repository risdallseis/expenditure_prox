So i'll keep this one to the usability.\nIn kids mode i don't like it, it has lots of games but you have to download everything and they are confusing between a book, game or video or youtube clip.  Much prefer the standard mode and download what apps you want, prime video can only be viewed via standard mode anyway, and alot of apps also only work in standard mode.",
            "I read alot of reviews to start with and I was nervous about the battery life not lasting. Immediate on set up i discovered easy ways to combat this. These are for kids use so straight away location off, alexa off, weather off etc. I find the battery lasts just fine for kids having a few hours occasionally, and i try to remember to turn them off when not in use. Only takes seconds to reboot anyway and the kids could do with learning a bit of patience.",

I say again its GREAT at what it does but I bought the wrong thing",

However we have found this very difficult to use in practice without giving it full access to the adult accounts to register it. Unregistered it doesn't work correctly.
