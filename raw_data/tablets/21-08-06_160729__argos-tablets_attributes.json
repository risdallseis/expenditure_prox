The touchscreen is very responsive with bright vivid colours and a good wide range of brightness. It handles having multiple apps open without slowing down, but doesn’t handle heavy gaming well as it slows down. Overall this is a very good tablet with lots of plus points.",
            "This tablet came well packaged. On starting up the battery was at 50%. It was easy to set up, as i only needed an email address to start. It runs on the android system, which my 7 year old daughter can operate. The screen size is 10.3, which enables the user to see clearly what is on the screen, as well as showing great pictures. It is quite heavy, but looks good. The operating system is quite fast, and it is easy to navigate. \nSo overall a great tablet that would benefit anyone.",
            "The Lenovo Is beautiful screen and dual front speakers which deliver immersive entertainment which is all packed into a thin and light profile. This tablet does everything that I would expect from one of the main tablet suppliers.

Even a beginner will have no problem navigating the functions and adjusting the settings to suit their individual needs. The picture quality is superb.",

The angle of reading is good, perfect for reading on the train. Facial recognition was a welcome feature. I loved that the charging plug can be used either way so no squinting to check it's in correctly. Only gripe is its smooth casing which made it difficult to grip but I got a case for it which sorted it out.",
            "Pros;\nMetal body. Very light but robust. Fast wi-fi. Fast processor. Great screen with good touch sensitivity, visuals, automatic brightness control, eye protection mode, split screen mode and fingerprints hardly show up. Sound, Wow! best I've heard on a tablet. Large 64gb storage expandable with micro sd card.. Note this model does not come with facility for a sim card as stated in another review.\nCons; Camera acceptable, not great.\nSummary; This tablet won't disappoint. I love it.",
            "Its super nice and feels expensive with the metal back. The screen looks like its on top of the glass and not inside. Still having to get used to the thin bezel around the screen when holding it in portrait, but the screen is big for its size. Its been easy to connect and the battery is great. Its not loaded with lots of unwanted apps. The front facing camera seems better than the rear for photos of people, Skype is great, the sound is loud, the microphones clear and its not stuttered or froze.",
            "I love this tablet, it's so easy to use. Set up was really easy. My children also find this tablet easy to use and have downloaded a multitude of games which has only used up 30% of my storage. The screen is huge and even automatically adjusts the brightness for you. The only downside is that I seem to need to charge it more than I would like,but it is barely put down and whilst all three children are at home it has been used for school work. All in all I highly recommend this tablet.",
            "This tablet has full HD screen and it makes great quality photos.The sound is excellent.Awesome battery life,which i never seen before. The screen is big enough for everything such as watching movies,playing games.The charging time is normal.The weight of the tablet is not too heavy.The metal batch gives a better feeling. The 4GB RAM is not that fast. The tablet is not connecting to Windows10Home,we cant import the pictures or videos.The 64GB capacity is necessary. The expandable memory is huge.",

Lenovo is the name, it is easy to use, its fast and battery life is excellent, after the initial charge up I have used it for a week and the battery is still strong.

            "The design of this is solid yet light to hold, as thin as a pencil . Sound and picture quality is excellent, very easy to set up and use , security is paramount and this tablet has an excellent kids mode that you can safely let your children use without worry. Extra memory can be added simply and all usual apps already downloaded and you can add your favourites with ease. The Dolby atmos is a nice feature to have while watching videos etc. Lenovo have done it again with this lovely new tablet.",
            "Super slim, this tablet is incredibly light but has many of the capabilities of a good laptop. Ultra sharp, HD colour images leap off the screen making it's camera a joy to use. The sound quality is the best I've heard on any similar device. Options for secure access give alternatives to the usual password, my favourite being a 'connect the dots' option. A minor issue is the SD card, the leaflet shows as if the card is enclosed, it's not, but this great tablet doesn't need it anyway.",
            "Having owned a Lenova a few years back, it is nice to have one that is sleek, fast and joy to use. A large, bright screen, stereo Atmos sound, 64 Mb storage built in and able to add SD card for more.\nDecent cameras for tear and selfie.\nWatching Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and all is thoroughly enjoyable on the large screen. Music through YouTube or Tidal is very good.\nLovely metal case and buttons at side easy to use. Seems to keep a decent battery charge all day",
            "A brilliant tablet, easy to set up. Super screen display, all nice and clear. Easy to download apps and games. The battery is brilliant I can play games for hours no problem. Camera quality is brilliant. Easy to transport in my handbag while on holiday to keep up to date with email and Facebook. I love the ease of switching it on and off.",
            "This is a really nice size tablet the picture is good nice and clear .\nThe sound is really good .\nThere is one draw back is trying to control brightness as .I used this to play a game when there was a dark part off the game I had to keep brightening the screen .\nHaven't put a SIM card in it yet as need to get one .\nThe cable to connect for charging could of been a bit longer \n..a nice feature is you have kids app installed so parents can control what kids watch or play ."
