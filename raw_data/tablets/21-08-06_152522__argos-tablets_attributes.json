I hope it will be improved with new driver soon.\nAlso, the keyboard is not great, especially if you use multiple languages input. I have to keep pressing the language button to change between the languages and hope it changes if I were lucky. It works once in 10-15 times. And languages switches unintentionally and randomly while typing. It needs to be stabilised. Otherwise, it is not useable as a \"pro\" devise. If you only use English, it might be ok."
