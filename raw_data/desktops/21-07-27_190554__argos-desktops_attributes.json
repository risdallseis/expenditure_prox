            "Monitor arrived today and seems fine however the mains didn't have UK plug. So monitor remained useless until I frantically found a shaver adaptor. Nowhere was I warned prior to purchase that it will not have UK power plug. Apart from that once turned on, pluged in; it seems fine. Didn't contain DP cable included either",
