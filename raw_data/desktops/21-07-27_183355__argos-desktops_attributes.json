            "The modern and sleek C24-963 will fit in to any family home while taking up minimal space. Combine this with the powerful Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM lets it handle all your day to day tasks with ease, from streaming video to working on documents. Watching films and browsing the web looks amazing on the 24 full HD IPS display. The 1TB HDD gives plenty of storage space to keep all your files. The 1MP webcam and built-in microphones are great for video calls and with included keyboard and mouse you are ready to go out of the box. "
