The display is particularly clear and I'm pleased to see an adequate number of USB ports.\nAs always with Realtek sound cards, this aspect really needs improvement but this can be bypassed with a decent audio interface but of course, it adds to the overall cost.\nSome software still needs a CDR/DVD player for installation but the Asos portable unit at around Â£25.00 does the job.\nWould I recommend the computer? Yes.",
