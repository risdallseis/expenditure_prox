            "This is second acer machine (previous laptop) and first desktop. So far everything very good, however the supplied keyboard and mouse, you wont really use it for long periods of office work, as they are not very well designed. The tower tilt is also a bit strange but it is there to aid heat dissaption.",
            "Bought as an upgrade and am quite happy with it.  Good spec (but I'm not a gamer).  Slight hum but not a significant issue. Usual raft of pre-installed irrelevant software that you have to uninstall but it seems all computers have that these days."
