            "After using comparison websites to check the specs this one kept appearing on my radar and the only reliable stockist I could find was Argos.\n\nThe phone itself is excellent, responsive, clear and fast as well as having brilliant rear and selfie cameras (that actually show too much detail in the selfies honestly - I don't need to see every pore!). Fast charging is a definite bonus and I find if I charge it for an hour in the morning it lasts all day, even with gaming and music/ video streaming."
