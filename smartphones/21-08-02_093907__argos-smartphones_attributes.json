My last phoned bricked after nearly three years use and this appeared to be the best value for <£150. The only thing letting it down really is that it had a 1.5GB update to apply, so it took a few hours before I could actually use it. That tends to be the norm these days so no big issue.",

In this respect it works well, although at this early stage, it is hard to compare the GPS performance with previous phones, hence four stars not five so far. Good value overall.",

Does everything that you need at a good price. Only let-down is the lack of fast charging, only a problem if you're a really heavy user. The battery will last most people well over a day.",

It is great to have a stripped down Android version without the bloatware that comes on most phones. It runs smoothly and is great value. It won't match top end phones but for what I need it is perfect and a great colour too.",

            "Generally a good phone having now been on my third phone in over a year. Good points  has headphone socket, distinctive colour, large screen. As a phone connects to web easily, takes clear images. So if you aren't too caught up in staying with specific manufacturers this is a strong alternative to your last phone.\nNegs: Too large to fit in jeans pocket, without doubt cheaper to throw away than repair.

I read the experts opinions a must anyway it runs on Android 10 it's a Android 1 phone I will get two years of satisfaction from security updates and updates in general that'll do me.",

            "This phone keeps making screen go black and not sure why, was hoping something good from Nokia but at mo disappointed",
            "Good phone for a kid. Has enough space for games.",

            "Great value for money. Superb camera,",
            "Purchased 2-3wks ago, so early days, but I have more confidence in this Nokia than in my two previous smartphones.  Acceptable size and weight, seems really fast working, easy to set up though not everything transferred across from my previous Android 6 phone.  So far, everything is encouraging.  I hoped for a different country of build, but it is the usual.\nWill it live up to the reputation of the previous Nokia's I used for a long time years ago?  …  I really hope so, but only time will tell.",
            "Bought my Nokia 5.3 to replace my old phone that was also a Nokia (Nokia 3), that had given me a good period of trouble free use. The 5.3 is very similar in design and operation, with a few differences that have been relatively some to master. It has a nice large screen, I use maps and this sure helps when navigating, I also link it to my vehicle as a sat nav it works fantastically. All round it's a decent phone, and does exactly as I had hoped, at fraction of the price some providers charge!.",
            "Thought I'd treat myself to a new phone but worst choice I've made the phone has a mind of it's own! Constantly freezing or will jump from app to app, it only charges some of the time, the camera isn't to bad but not the best of you need to voom in on anything. I'd take it back but once you've opened the box you can't so I'm stuck with it and had to buy another phone as I need something reliable with being a carer which this is far from",
            "Does feel on the cheap side with the plastic back but still a good phone.",
            "Quality phone for the price you pay!!!",
            "I am really pleased with this phone. It looks good, works well and doesn't need charging too often. My partner has a top of the range phone costing a few hundred pounds more and thinks this one is just as good.",

            "Nokia 5.3 - This is my first smartphone so I can't say how it compares with others. \nChosen for: dual SIM, NFC for contactless payments. \nPros: Voice transmission considerably clearer than 2G phone it replaces. Camera better than my 10-year old Samsung camera. \nCons: too slippery to hold comfortably without a textured flexible cover (add £7). Screen doesn't rotate 180 degrees so can't be used with charging cable at top of sceen. Google Assistant button (I don't use. Disable in Settings).",
            "works really well. easy to set up, was easy to transfer apps etc from old phone to this one. very happy with phone",
            "For the money it’s a good phone.\nI only use my phone for Facebook, WhatsApp, calls, emails and texting so it’s a great for me.\nIf you want a better camera then obviously you’d need a more expensive buy!",
            "Bought as quick cheap replacement. Pleased with purchase",
            "I did buy this phone but returned it after 10 days. Argos staff were excellent with the return and money refunded quickly. This is probably the worst mobile I've owned, constantly lost internet even right next to modem. I used more data in the days I had it than I do for a month normally as I pick up internet in my home because I'm retired. I must say the camera was excellent.",

            "Ideal phone for what I need",
            "It's a good device, fast performance and with a slick design, good memory and storage capacity. Wasn't very happy to have to update it before using it (1.5gb of android system updates) but that's a minor issue, I think. Battery as expected.",

            "Easy to set up and use . good camera.",
            "It was easy to setup especially if your not mobile phone savvy but I found it easy to use when it was all setup. Only one thing that I would recommend which I have been told is with a big majority of phones nowadays maybe an easy setup manual for people that are not savvy with them",

            "It honestly a great phone as it said the battery last two days I believe it 3 days as I don't need to put my phone in charge as much as I used too with my old phones I had in the passed",
            "Great phone that's very easy to set up and very easy to use; it navigates very smoothly. I have compared it to other more expensive phones in the same category and it can't be beaten.

            "I got this as a Christmas gift for my mother (although it was more of a gift to me to stop her complaining about her previous phone!). Phones from reliable brands like Nokia have become good, highly capable and best of all, cheaper. For someone like mam, (who isn't the most... digitally capable) this phone is more than powerful enough. It allows her to run features like the camera, whatsapp, outlook and Chrome easily.

            "It's a great phone and easy to use and get used to.\nThe memory is great especially if you use your phone more for games.\nBattery life is great however if you use it a lot for gaming then it would need charging at least once a day otherwise it'll last about 2 days",
            "Works fine for basic usage of browsing, YouTube, phone, etc... Not tried any games, so not sure how it would handle that. Rear camera is decent, front camera less so. Sound is OK, a bit poor at low volume. Screen fine and notch is small and unobtrusive. Quite a big phone. Good value for money overall, but not outstanding. Nokia good at security updates though and it is a proper dual SIM phone with another space for an SD card.",
            "Thanks for exelent purchase.",
            "Nice phone and reasonably priced",
            "Using my Nokia 5.3 phone to write this review. Have owned it several weeks now and chose it for its memory size, Android 1 operating system and price. There are not too many 64GB phones in the price range and being Android 1 it comes free of bloat ware with guaranteed software updates and a version enhancements.\nDoes everything I need so far and am happy with this choice of low cost phone.",
            "Worst phone ever purchased. Worked well for 2 weeks then suddenly started randomly restarting itself and freezing/crashing apps . Appears to be a common problem when you search it. Avoid at all costs !",

            "This is a phone for my 12 year old daughter. We got it as an exchange from a Motorola E6 plus which broke under warranty. The Nokia 5.3 is better in every respect, especially battery life where it excels. \nMy daughter is very pleased with it",
            "Amazing phone. Better than my previous expensive ones.",
            "This is my secondary phone for personal use as I want to keep my business matters separate.  I wanted a decent amount of memory, a decent screen and a lack of bloatware from the dominant manufacturers.  This is an Android One phone that guarantees it's as near to plain vanilla as possible.\n\nOne gripe - the Nokia tune on bootup!  You can't turn it off!  That doesn't really fulfill the promise of stock Android.  Manufacturers shouldn't push their brand like that.",

Very nice phone, holds charge well and takes nice pics. I mainly use phone to search Google, shop and check emails and instagram. If this is the usual price range you go for then this phone won't disappoint.",

Nice large screen but sadly no one handed mode. Gesture navigation not always responsive, had to go with a 3rd party launcher to get my desired text size. Better phones out there for the price.",

I found it very valuable as there is nothing else to look for in any smart phone. The only issues is the battery only last 24hrs before you just have to recharge for next day.

            "It is execllent and I save a lot £££ for the same spec as another well brand name.   so why pay over £400. for a Sam or I for a well know brand returning on the market.",
            "I bought this for my wife she is well pleased, as her old phone broke and this is the next model. Does everything and more than she expected",
            "Colour is lovely, camera is very good has great focus. I'm usually LG but because most are discontinued and not coming out to the UK I chose this one. Has same or slight better camera views and clear pictures as the LG. Happy with my choice. Would recommend this.",

I'm not very tech savvy but the styling is great,I got the cyan backed phone which really stands out and looks fab,the screen is nice and bright and super sensitive to touch,which can get a little annoying , It has all the features I need and some I don't,I don't really use the camera but the photos I've taken seem to be worthy of a much more expensive phone/camera. Ups, lots. Downs, none so far.",

            "For the price this is a great phone. It looks stylish. I went for the greenish/bluish colour, and with the graduated colour along the curved back this catches the eye. Everybody is asking me \"What phone is that?\" Nokia, really??\nThe screen is bright, great colours, big. The features are great, fingerprint sensor, face recognition, amazing battery life, NFC for contactless payments. The phone is responsive, little or no delay when asking it to open apps and games.\nWould definitely recommend!",

            "Pros: large screen but still fits in my pocket, a slim phone, lovely colour [green/blue], good battery, charges quickly, great sound, 2 sims & micro sd card slots, user friendly. \n\nCons: if you are accident prone / tend to drop things I highly recommend a decent phone cover for more grip, can't remove the Google search bar from the home screen [which bothered me as I never use it], gets warm with use.",
            "Solid phone keep away from water and it's perfect",
            "A very average phone, yes it is a cheap budget phone but it isn't very good. Battery life and design are best aspects of this phone. With a large battery it lasts a long time and performance is decent too. What let's it down are the washed out screen with pale colours. And the cameras are just awful, even using HDR the images just come out very dark all the time.",
            "I purchased this phone as it was a good brand as recommended by Ethical Consumer magazine. There are a couple of things that bug me a bit about it though, and I am not sure I would try the brand again. The phone makes the most awfully loud chime noise when switching on, which is not needed at all, so I set it for bedtime mode and then the time I wake up is still covered by it, so it does not chime. The camera does not have a built in QR reader which is madness, and notifications can be sketchy",
            "So far I’m very pleased. It seems to do everything I expect from a phone, and Ikm very impressed with the battery life.",
            "Great phone at a great price. I personally think this does everything an iPhone does at a budget price. Got all the latest processor etc.",
            "Pros:\n- Huge screen.\n- Massive battery (lasts about 2 days).\n- Runs apps smoothly and fast.\n- Expandable memory.\n- 3.5mm headphone port.\n- In the right conditions it takes good photos.\n- Feels well made and nice in the hand.\n- Contactless payments.\n- Dual SIM.\n- Cyan looks cool. \n\nCons:\n- Camera sometimes struggles to focus, \n particularly in low light conditions.\n- No fast charging.\n- Sound could be better.",
            "It does what I want for a reasonable price.",

            "Great phone easy to use and good battery life  looks good too",
            "This is a great phone for the price. Screen size is perfect , battery life very good , not overloaded with apps. Fairly easy set up but great one to one support from the online help service should you need it. I found adding a custom ring tone difficult. Internet connection very fast . Very happy with my purchase , in fact my husband has now bought one !!\nWould recommend a clear plastic case (Amazon) as it is very slippy in the hand and I was worried it might slip and break .",
            "The phone is on a large side. The selfie camera is a bit grainy when on a video call and worse compared to what it was on my old phone (what I heard from the people I spoke to).  But it seems ok when taking selfies. Another thing is that I seem to have more 'dead' spots around the house where I lose my network than before. I haven't changed network provider but the phone. In general I'd recommend it for a budget buyer.",
            "Easy to use and transfer everything from my old phone would recomend",

            "Absolutely delighted with the design, colour, features and quality.",
            "I bought this as a replacement for a faulty Nokia 2.3 and I think the extra money was worth it. The camera is excellent and the battery life means you can go all day without worrying about charging or carrying battery packs. The 64GB memory means I can have all the apps I need without having to spend time clearing up space. Its maybe a little bit bigger than Id like, but fits in pocket fine.",
            "Fantastic quick downloads loads of features, excellent picture quality and many more features",
            "only thing i could complain about is a 'fuzzyness' of the sound sometimes. other than that is good",
            "Love the easy to use functions and the larger screen (compared to my previous phone). Would highly recommend.",
            "A replacement to Samsung Note 8. Good size screen, Android One and amazing battery life.\n\nThe cameras are not sharp, worst if in the dark. The \"smart features\" are not as intuitive as the Note 8. This Nokia does not have any IP rating, so don't go near to any water.\n\nIf you are using this Nokia as a phone, YouTube, browsing the internet, then you will have no problem at all. But if you are into gaming, then this may not be the right phone as the spec can't handle some of the high end games.",
            "Bought for my husbands birthday.  For the price it's a fab phone.  Looks up to date and fresh and I was genuinely surprised at how stylish it looked.  Complete value for money and would recommend.",

Camera quality is excellent, battery life and storage both phenomenal.\n\nThis was a purchase for my 13 year old sine, who was really happy with it, however after 10 days it started to loop on and off and wouldn't get passed the android screen.",

Take it outside and worked fine.\nNo good whatsoever inside\nDecent enough looking phone but cameras junk. \nGot a used iPhone 8 for only two hundred from elsewhere with twenty four months warranty",

            "Android One on a Nokia phone runs clean and smooth and updated itself to the latest system and security settings immediately. Battery life is at least 2 days, often 3 days. Out of curiosity I tried the Support app built into the phone and got an online chat with a human being, able to offer help and advice almost immediately. What other brand offers that?\nAuto brightness can fluctuate without warning which is annoying. Apparently it's an Android 10 issue but turning it off solved the problem.",
            "It's a very good phone, long battery life, features easy to understand. Good value for money",
            "If you want to make calls, send texts, use WhatsApp and take a few photos then you will do well to find a better phone at the price.

            "Great looking phone in cyan (it's blue, not green as the website insists on telling you) . Smooth, fast and reliable. Performance (IMHO) is as good as many phones costing 2 or 3 times the price. Could be better screen/camera/speaker, but dual SIM AND SD slot at this price is amazing. WiFi calling (if your provider supports it) is another bonus. Bought to replace an ageing Moto G5+ (home) and a Samsung Galaxy (work). Now carrying 1 phone instead of 2. Thoroughly recommended.",
            "Screen size is very good. Quality of the camera and the hardware is pretty good for the price. Design is also great. I would say that at this price you can't go wrong, it can compete with mid ranged phones easy. Never had any issues so far. \n\nThe only one down side is that it doesn't have a back button, I know many people using Android are used to having a back button. But we can get used to it.",

            "First Nokia phone. The screen is larger than I would like but most new phones are like this. The display is fine for my use. The only issue I have the phone is that it is proving difficult to answer a normal phone call. I swipe up, down sides ways and still I continue to miss calls. Hope this is just me and I find a way to answer calls promptly. The one thing that should be easy is using the phone as a phone ,never mind all the fancy bits of a smart phone. Other than this issue all seems ok.",

The 2 year updates to Android and the fact it runs on Android 10 is fab. It is ready for Android 11. Swiping for all functions is simple and easy. Finger print scanner for unlocking phone is poor.

Clean software experience, being a Android one device. The look of the phone is nice, I got the dark green colour, but you can feel the build quality in your hand, which is not bad but you can just feel is plastic. The phone can cope even with games like Asphalt 9, COD mobile. And you put everything in balance with the price this is best buy on a low budget.",

Part of Android One program - with 2 year updates guaranteed; no bloatware here!\n3. Very smooth operation - down to excellent chip-set(Snapdragon 665) and Ram (4Gb)\n4. Huge 64Gb storage - expandable with MicroSD\n4. Very clear screen with Gorilla Glass (less breakages)\n5. Very good camera with depth perception available",
            "i got this for my stepson who broke his nokia 6.2. this, while seeming to be more budget friendly was still an upgrade in specs except for the screen whish is still fine. my son is impressed & since this, my stepdaughter has also bought one as the deal is so good from argos at the moment. all in all a nice looking phone with all the needed features such as nfc etc.",
            "I've had this phone for a few weeks now and I love it. I haven't had any issues and it works as it should. The only downside I've found is that the camera is not amazing, but for the price I wouldn't expect much better. A big plus is that the battery lasts really long.",
            "Plenty of storage and upgraded to Android 10 soon as I started using it. Ideal for me as I only use mail, browsing and Whatsapp with the occasional phone call on PAYG.",
            "You should be fine if You will keep running this path.",
            "it works. That is good. It is a phone. Looks nice. It was a fair price.",
            "It looks fab and love the sleek design. Good battery health but would love to have a bit more features though you can download most of the features now a days. I am a big Nokia fan and love to see Nokia making a come back.",
            "Easy to use, large screen plenty of memory. Battery lasts a good 36-48hrs.\nGreat value for money",
            "nice phone, easy to use, good price",
            "I wanted a phone that was fairly quick, had good battery life, was not bloated with unnecessary software and cost less than £150 and the Nokia 5.3 ticked all the boxes. It also comes with a guaranteed 2 years of Android updates. Brilliant phone, love it!",
            "The phone is good it does the job the only down side is that there is no zoom in feature on the camera which is a tad annoying.",
            "Wife is pleased with it, makes me happy, easy to use good battery life latest updates I would recommend this phone",
            "Looks pretty good and performs well. There may be sound quality issues during some conversations",
            "I don’t get on with iPhones this phone is ideal for me",
            "Phone is ok, but nothing great. Very fragile, it fell once and it's already cracked in one corner.\nI hate how you have to swipe from the right or left edge of the screen to \"go back to the previous screen\" you were in, as it keeps doing it whenever you touch close to the edge, which is almost impossible not to do in some games/websites.",
            "More than happy with it as I bought it going off reviews that I'd read",
            "Transferring contacts from old phone was almost completely automatic, very impressed. Display is great and generally a nice phone to use, everything works well and plenty of storage built in, with option to expand easily and inexpensively. Preferable to iphone, latest Android OS does everything I need and much better value.",
            "I got this as an upgrade from the Nokia 5.1. Massive improvements on some features but others that I prefer with the original, like the back button has gone and it's now a swipe action.\nBattery life easily two days, camera is brilliant. Screen has a slight curve at the edge so glass protector is not suitable.\nDefinitely good phone for the money",
            "It is a good phone, I like the camera and battery life. Only drawback is it is hard to go backwards and forwards between screens.",
            "Pure Android experience on a budget phone. Great camera, battery life. True value for money. Nokia Brand.",
            "Fab mobile, very pleased with the features and cost",
            "It's a nice looking phone and once I get the hang of it I will probably love it. What I did not love was to see it now reduced by £20 just a month after I bought it and have only just been able to get it working with a new sim card and some wizardry from a lady at the local Tesco phone shop as my existing card did not fit into the flimsy plastic drawer in the side of the Nokia phone.",
            "fast and good call quality. Instructions could be better",
            "excellent phone for everyday use. down side is finger print sensor is on the back of the phone so makes it virtually unusable if you are using the phone in a phone case.",
            "Honestly think this is superior to the Motorola's I've had b4 just thought I'd try the old faithful Nokia and it hasn't disappointed!",
            "im happy with my new phone used to have a nokia years ago so am happy they have bought this one out and is updated",
            "A BRILLIANT WEE PHONE FOR THE MONEY NOKIA HAVE DEFO GOT IT TOGETHER I HAVE THE 7.2 ALSO AND THE 5.3 IS JUST AS GOOD SUPERB",
            "A decent phone, great camera, not so suited for old folk as a first smart phone",
            "Nice phone for very good price.",
            "Nice phone good response and good battery only disapointment was Argos dropping the price two days after i bought mine by £20.00",
            "Great phone, full of features and fast spec. The camera isn't great but I own s camera so no big thing for me. With Android one you are guaranteed at least two years support.",
            "Really good phone, battery lasts for ages and picture quality is really good.",
            "I've been using phone for two weeks without any problems. \nWhen i unboxed the phone it was easy to start up and transfer contacts via Google. The cyan colour looks good. The phone is responsive and fast when using apps and internet. Screen is clear and good size. The camera is better than I expected, the main camera takes good pictures, the wide angle and night time setting also achieve good results. But the macro lens not do good.",
            "I brought this, but changed mind.",
            "Absolutely love this phone impressed with features very quick response love the quad camera especially the depth can get all the apps I previously needed different phone for",
            "Very slow transfer of data from existing phone.\nStill have not fathomed all the uses and there was no manual with the product",
            "I would highly recommend this phone. The performance, sound and graphics are amazing.",
            "By far my best value mobile phone yet. Perfect balance of features, performance, size and price. This is our fourth Nokia mobile phone in 20 years and is an excellent example of how far the Finnish company has advanced in that time.",
            "Great phone with two years of updates.",
            "Nokia phone is really value for money, battery Life is exceptionally good...Easy to use and navigate...",
            "It's great value for money",
            "Decent phone for the money. Screen is large which is great for games and movies",
            "Little awkward to connect phone to WiFi due to android 10, software.",
            "I am impressed with this phone. In fact second one in family purchased",
            "For the price of the phone it does everything I require.",
            "I am blessed to have found my Nokia 5.3 on the Argos website at such a time. I am benefiting greatly from a small investment. It's absolutely fantastic.",
            "There's nothing about this phone that I don't like. The colour is nice and unisex. It has a large screen that's really clear. The camera is fantastic, even has a macro lens for taking close up pics of wildlife which I love",
            "Excellent phone with plenty of features and an exceptionaly reasonable price tag.",
            "This Nokia phone is a delight to use. It has a large internal memory and supports a very large external memory. I have installed 256g external memory and to boost the 64g internal memory. I cannot be happier to have this phone because the phone takes quality pictures so I can explore nature with confidence of taking more photos. The battery lasts long too.",
            "If like me you're not prepared to spend money on big contracts and expensive phones, I'm sure you'll like the Nokia 5.3.\n\nGood camera, slick operating system with guaranteed Google updates for two years, 64gb is plenty.\n\nI normally get Motorola phones as they are great budget phones too, but opted for Nokia for NFC which Motorola doesn't have. So between the two this one has the better connectivity option.",
            "I think the latest Nokia's are great value for money. \nThis was an upgrade from my Nokia 5 with more of everything, screen, memory, battery, lenses, etc.\nHappy....",
            "It's a little taller than I'd prefer, but I got used to it quick. It's fast and doesn't feel like there was any compromise despite being mid-way between the older and newer Nokias.",
            "Good phone and very good service",
            "Nokia is a nice phone",
            "This phone was picked for me by my son and grandson, as I am a bit of a technophobe. It does everything I need and more. They said it was quite easy to set up, one thing I find is that the battery doesn't last as long as said. Saying that I do more things on it that I didn't do on my last phone. It does last a day though, perhaps I am being a bit unfair.",
            "Been using this device for a few weeks now and it's great! Was a little scared as I've had an unpleasant experience a few years ago with an inexpensive Android device but this is very performant (for what I'm doing, which is basic usage [Pokemon Go])",
            "grandaughter loves it",
            "Love a good simple design",
            "I can say  my phone was very cheap and best",
            "Having had problems with other makes of budget smartphones recently I thought that I would give the good old Nokia brand a chance. \nMy 5.3 has happily surpassed all of my expectations so far, especially the battery life.\n Easy to use and understand, with the latest operating system, lightweight and bright, fast and sensitive, with easily available accessories too.\nWhat is there not to like?",
            "Great phone love it thanks very much",
            "i had high hopes going back to Nokia using an android os but its not as good as it could have been\nmost of what you would expect from android is there but a few features that ive had with other android phones are not there and the os is not as fast as it could be\n\nall in all not bad but not up there with the best",
            "The battery life is exceptional I can get 3 days out of one charge, suits me well.  Great phone for the money",
            "The phone is cheap for the price. A very good camera for selfie. I love it",
            "It's been a long time since I bought a Nokia phone. However, this phone represents a fantastic return to form from the company. It has a fantastic battery life that can last over 2 days without charging (even with moderate use), a set of 5 incredible cameras (I've attached some pics taken on the Nokia 5.3) and has the same hardware specs as more expensive phones. The phone itself can open and run apps very quickly with clear visuals on it's spacious screen. 5/5 for an all-round excellent phone.",
            "This is my second Nokia smartphone. Good features for the price especially with NFC included. Running pure Android without unwanted apps and receiving regular updates from Nokia. Would recommend.",
            "Love the new phone still getting used to it.i have been using a Samsung but wanted a change.i had Nokia's when I was younger and loved the phones. Since using Nokia 5.3 I can tell I needed an upgrade and so far I am not disappointed. Love the style and design the memory is great.camera has 13mp which is all I need.glad with my desicion so far thank you",
            "I bought this handset as a cheapy in-between model as my previous handset was lost\nI thought this would be durable and get the job done for few months.\n\nThe battery life is great and it looks good for the price but that's where the pros end.\nIt struggles with video calls, games seem to lag and struggle to load\n\nThe screen cracked after falling out of my pocket whilst I was on my knees (1ft) not what I was expecting from Nokia. \n\nIn short, I wouldn't sell this to my worst enemies",
            "Very nice, good value",
            "I like the look of the phone, screen, great battery, etc. I chose Nokia because they are sturdy. This is a back up phone. Some features e.g. the camera could be better in terms of the colours.  Some apps that come as standard e.g. voice recorder need downloading otherwise ok. I will keep the phone - it does what it needs to do. My other phone an Honor 10 - to which this is a back up - is too delicate and if the glass breaks one more time it goes in the bin and the Nokia takes it's place. :-)",
            "Really pleased with this phone, battery life can last over 3 days, the memory is ample to install numerous apps plus you can install a micro SD card to store pictures and videos. It is a dual SIM phone and both Sims are active at the same time you just set a preferred SIM for mobile data usage. The only slight gripe is the fingerprint reader sometimes does not respond first time.",
            "Excellent quality. Looks good. Feels good. Clear and responsive screen. Clear good quality sound. Long battery life even under heavy usage. Camera works well, both front and rear.",
            "This is a great phone for the money. It's very quick and responsive and very user-friendly. It's running on the latest Android 10 and guaranteed to upgrade to Android 11 etc. The camera and video is spot on. It's got a nice bright screen which fits nicely in your hand and lightweight compared to my old phone. It's great to have 64gb of on board storage. Happy.",
            "i bought this phone for my daughter. she is very happy with it this is a well built phone from an established manufacturer .the main reason for buying is of course its excellent value for money.comes with android 10 operating system plus 2 years updates .good camera/good screen resolution not bad internet speed.has same functions as more expensive phones do.best phone in its class.",
            "Good phone for regular use.",
            "great phone the screen is amazing it all works well \nsome things are different the way you use screen etc but getting used to it \nall in all a good phone",
            "So far I have no issue with the issue",
            "Easy ordering online and collect the item next day from the store.\nGreat phone with lots of features, 4 cameras, 64gb storage. Fast responsive touch screen with excellent battery life. \nEasy to use android 10 operating system with available updates.",
            "This was a positive choice, and has proven to be a good find!   I have to sat the size and feel is fantastic, and it is easy to navigate and get used to!    I have found nothing negative to date, and I definitely recommend this phone.",
            "Got for dad, battery life great, easy enough to set up and good big screen. A lot better than apple as can use different apps. Camera Is good also. Great that’s it’s sim free no hassle",
            "This phone is definitely worth the money. After receiving the delivery which was excellent service.\nThis phone with the guaranteed Android updates and is very easy to use.\nBattery charger is brilliant always getting about 2 days out of this phone.",
            "A great phone for the price paid, easy to set up and use. only reason i gave it 4/5 for features, is because i haven't had a chance to use/try all the features as yet, but very pleased so far",
            "I`m new to Android so am getting used to it.Works really well and quickly. Excellent battery life.",
            "This phone is massively let down by it's fingerprint reader and face unlock, it just doesn't work properly. I've never known a fingerprint reader to be this bad. The phone also jams up frequently it's very annoying. This is my first modern Nokia purchase and it will be my last. This is a definitely a budget phone and nowhere near as good as a Motorola.",
            "This is a great phone which even after a full days use, still has about 50-60% battery life left at night with its 4000mAh battery. It is well built with a bright screen, 64Mb of storage, which can be expanded, NFC for contactless payments and near stock android, so no bloatware. It should also come with 3 yrs of monthly security updates and 2 OS updates, which will take it to Android 11 and 12 in the future. Easy to use and feels comfortable in the hand for a device with a 6.55 screen.",
            "GOOD PHONE AT A SENSIBLE PRICE. AS IT IS NEW IT IS YET TO BE FULLY PUT THROUGH IT,S PACES BUT IT SETS UP EASILY AND HAS A BIT WEIGHT ABOUT IT WHICH.I THINK. IS ONE SIGN OF BETTER QUALITY. NOKIA IS A SOUND BRAND AND THIS PHONE HAS THE BENEFIT OF FREE UPDATES FOR TWO YEARS. I RECOMMEND THE NOKIA 5.3 AS A SOUND AND SAFE PURCHASE.",
            "the phone is to big screen is to big"
