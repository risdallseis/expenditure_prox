            "I bought it a month ago and I am very happy thank you",
            "I used to be a iphone user but I thought I want a change as iphones are all the same and very boring. My s21 ultra is the best phone I've had, I learn new things about it everyday and using it is so joyous. I'm never getting an iPhone again.",
            "I love the size of the phone, the simplicity of use, all the great features, all the customisable options and best of all I can use my old S-PEN from my old Note9. Loving the new supercharging speed and the new 5G data speeds. Excellent quality phone.",
            "Upgrading from an s9 iv had a fantastic experience, a bigger screen makes movies and game much more enjoyabl. a faster refresh rate makes scrolling on this phone feel like butter!",
            "Screen refresh rate, brightness and resolution is excellent. Camera zoom is impressive but I have not seen the need to actually use it in the last 2 months. Back of the phone feels really cheap though, like a thin plastic and definitely not up to scratch for a premium model. I went for the custom Samsung brown colour back. Speaker for calls is not very loud and for some reason, neither Bluetooth sound output compared to the S10. The the camera doesn't seem like much of an upgrade from my S10 either. Portrait mode looks way better on the new iPhone. Performance is very quick and responsive at least.",
            "Samsung s21 ultra is the best camera phone out at the moment",
            "I've not spent long enough with the phone yet to say how happy I am but I am really disappointed the phone doesn't come with a charger or headphones, or USB-C - headphone jack adapted. I've spent a very significant amount of money on a phone and now have to go and buy wires to make it work?\n\nOtherwise the styling and build quality are what you'd expect from a high-end Samsung phone.",
            "Have  used Samsung phones for years now and this is the best phone I have used in years.\nSo easy to set up.\nThe camera is amazing and easy to use.",
            "WHAT A PHONE! an absolute must. S10 to s21 is such a massive difference",
            "Coming from the Note9 the S21 ultra 5g has a lot to beat but hey we are some 4 years on so the S21 ultra's going to be a monster yes? sadly NO... I'm now 3 days into getting my Ultra and I want to throw it in the bin. I keep asking why have you done this Samsung! Firstly I found it lagging on touch response and had to go in and increase sensitivity and switch off a whole load of stuff just to get it respond quick enough to my touch input. Now they have removed the home button wake up feature in favour of a \"Double Tap\" on the screen. its just hard work the home button was simple and quick, now I spend ages pecking at the screen hoping it will wake at some point! Having to double up on things instead of keeping it simple seems to be a theme!. if you run dual sim you can only call back on the sim you were called on, when the note gave you the option in the record which sim to use. When writing a text you have to select the sim ahead of sending the message in the Note9 you had send 1 or 2. Its just not as slick or intuitive as I was hoping for. It has some good features you can assign a default sim to  a person so family by default can be on my own sim and clients on my work one. all in all at its price point I'm left regretting the purchase for now. Samsung, why take away simplicity? the silly part is that it may have a great camera (that ive not even used yet) but unless the rest is slick and simple its a paperweight to me",
            "Always been iphone owner but they become very boring past few years ,but Samsung and the ultra just keep getting better each time close to perfection",
            "Had this now for a month it is superb , the quickness of it , the camera is great , still got lots to learn about it but very happy",
            "The best smartphone, i love it. I am using for a month and battery life is amaizing",
            "It's great...............................................................     ........",
            "On the good side: the phone is better than I have expected it to be. For years I have deliberately avoided Samsung Galaxy series and S21 Ultra is my first one. But I have been convinced to be loyal to the brand. The phone is filled with Samsung bloatware apps, but what bothers me the most is the night time photography quality. I have had before 3 magnificent Huawei phones. Compared with them, the night mode and the night stills on S21 Ultra are just rubbish, completely unusable. The night sky is grainy and noisy, the moon is a shapeless, devoid of details, white messy spot. And overall, the pictures are lacking in clarity and details. I have expected so much more, considering the quality of the hardware for the camera system. I am very disappointed and if the problem will not be resolved soon, I don't think I will keep the phone, although I haven't had it for more than a month.",
            "I'm with samusng since galaxy s3 and I have swap to s21 from s10 and I'm really disappointed as don't see any changes apart camera and refresh rate some things are even worse like screen resolution.  Don't get me wrong it is a decent phone but for a flagship series not really, very disappointed as if you look back into s20 s10 it's not worth the upgrade as you want see any difference apart the money you spend",
            "Not been with samsung for 5 years glad I switched back",
            "The 120hz display is so crisp it's amazing when I watch YouTube videos and when I'm phoning my mates they can see all the details oh and the cameras are the best thing with single take 2.0 I can take videos and photos in 10 seconds which saves time thats what I like oh and the fingerprint sensor thank god u improved that its much bigger than the one on the s10 oh and the design is flawless",
            "Completely in awe of my Galaxy S21 Ultra although pricey it is 100% worth it. I've owned it for just over a month and still finding out new things. This phone is capable of so many things. Incredible display/picture, durable I've dropped a couple of times oooops but with the factory fitted screen protector I have luckily avoided any damage bar a scratch.",
            "I moved back to Samsung from Huawei having been a Samsung user for years.\n\nMaking calls using speaker phone is pointless, as unless the phone is litterally on the end of my nose no one can hear and the sound breaks up leaving me to having to go old school and actually to pick up the phone.!! \n\nBUT of course I have the free ear buds.....however only one of them charges, \nSo ultimately have to use the phone as God intended sending me back to the dark ages of having to hold my phone to my ear again....\n\nWhere did it all go wrong Samsung....\nI am now subject to much shaming courtesy of the loved ones around me, who giggle and point as I try to make this silly new phone prove its worth....\n\nEven my 70+ year old parents point and chuckle and the ineptitude of my shineg new s21 ultra...\n\n\nWhat have you do Samsung...how could you....?",
            "For a big phone, it's surprisingly light.  Processing is speedy, touch screen responsive and there is no better phone camera on the market in my opinion.",
            "You could be forgiven for thinking that phone designers gradually build on previous designs and continually better the product. But, they don't. This phone has an incredibly good camera but, the file size is very large. Therefore the only option that you would really consider is the 512GB and it isn't currently available in the UK. Never mind, you can have a lower memory option of 128 or 256GB and store photos on the micro SD card, except you can't because they decided not to provide one with this phone.\nThe conclusion is that it's an excellent phone with a lovely screen, superb image quality and many good features. It is perhaps one of the very best but, the features that would have set it substantially ahead of all the competition and score 5 stars are not available yet: namely, the micro SD card and the 512GB option for the UK. The performance is excellent and it is capable of running 5G which is useful if you happen to be in an area offering it. Much of the UK struggles to operate 3G, let alone 4G or 5G. You need to be careful when purchasing because many of these phones offering the 512GB option are available but, they are not the UK version. They are International or US versions and this fact is rarely included in the advert but, will generally be supplied if you ask the question before purchase. The design would be worthy of 5 stars if the 512GB option was available in the UK now and if the micro SD card available on earlier phones had not been omitted from this model. The cost is similar to other major competitors with the same or similar features,",
            "By far the best camera never in a phone.\nAmazing quality and features within choosing shot. Live focus was better on S20 though as portrait mode just isn't the same.\nBattery life is amazing too.\nThe only negative is the weight, after a short while it actually makes your hands ache while holding.\nOtherwise 9/10",
            "Everything is done to its best, I am in love with the camera, Not one thing will be missed now, the battery life is also outstanding, by far this is the best phone I've owned and seen from Samsung",
            "I have had this phone for 5 months  and I have still yet to find a thing I don't like, as you would expect the camera is absolutely top class and I have been able to take some amazing photos.\nIt's fast without affecting the battery and the screen is noticeably better than my previous Note 10+.",
            "Absolutely 100% brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant",
            "It is a very nice phone all the features are great but I personally love the camera and photo clarity.",
            "Knows everything what I love in a phone, the cameras are just incredible. I use my s21 ultra about a month ago, and had no issues at all.",
            "The S21 Ultra is a fantastic phone with a lot of potential, however after the last update I have a lot of issues with my camera focus and this has now became very frustrating",
            "I have the Samsung 21 for 6 weeks , the camera is amazing and ease of features great. Love the colour but would like a new charger very disappointed that the expensive phone had no new charger.",
            "Everything has been made better in my opinion.  Awesome upgrade for me. Very happy with purchase...",
            "Upgraded from the s10 to the s21 and tbf there isn't much change. The battery life is just as bad as the s10 after having that for over a year. S10 actually looks better than the s21 which is a shame, over priced phone that doesn't out do the old generation of phone",
            "This phone goes above and beyond expectations. Previously apple, converted for life. Works seamlessly with the galaxy watch 3. Love it",
            "The pinnacle at the minute. Only reason to knock a star off is for battery, whilst still good as a heavy user I still have to charge during the day. However, better than anything else out there as far as I am aware. Camera is superb for a mobile device-  impressed",
            "I had samsung many years ago and hated the software on the phone but thought I'd give it a go and if I didn't like the phone I would just send it back. But to my surprise I'm keeping the phone and recommend it to many friends. My biggest gripe was the software but low and behold its improved massively its not stock but what they have done works I'm more than happy with it the camera is one of the best and battery life is OK I can get a full day's use out of it",
            "Well pleased with phone",
            "Got my new S21 5G yesterday but the battery seems to discharge much faster than my old S9.  Everything else is great but a big disappoinment re the battery on a phone less than 12 hours old.",
            "5000 man battery drains vin few hours. No advantage of integrated 5G modem . My iPhone 12 Pro max battery lasts 5 times longer than S21 Ultra battery . Even Mi phones much better in battery life",
            "The phone is performing great, but I wish we could have the Snapdragon rather than the Exynos, other than that the phone is good for the price.",
            "Beautiful looking phone great graphics everything is instant soon as you open any app. Photo quality is the best ive ever seen of all the samsung phones ive had over the years. Am so impressed an am recommending this phone to all my friends",
            "The phone and feature set is amazing only problem is it is let down by poor reception a dead spot where I would loss signal for 20m is now a 2 mile dead spot this is going from a p30 pro to a s21 ultra if it wasn't for that it would get 5 stars",
            "The phone is great, fast computing speed, amazing camera, sleek modern design. Only problem is when you use the phone to even half of it's capability it's heats up and fast. In 2 months of first receiving my first S21 Ultra I have already returned 2 for getting hot and very poor network speed. One was repaired my a Samsung verified company \"Wefix\" and found the battery was faulty but had no network issues, I would get less that 30% of the network speed I was getting on my old S10. Only about 3 times have I even used more than 8GB's of ram and the phone was making my hand sweat. If you don't plan you using the phone regularly as a \"power house\" it will be perfect for you. If you need a phone to use all day for heavy load work don't buy it or atleast be ready for the hot phone and battery drains.",
            "Love the s21 ultra, a fast phone and has a fantastic camera",
            "Its a reasonably hard move from ios but the hardwear and smooth software make for a pleasant experience",
            "I am not happy with this, but I I moved from the Note 10 + 5g to this. The stylus and case needed are expensive and the phone does not respond as well to the stylus as the Note. The camera takes great shots but there is a significant delay between pressing the shutter and the shot being taken.",
            "In love with display soooo good picture quality and best battery life",
            "The cameras as so incredible and the performance is never ending not to mention the mind boggling screen which looks unreal",
            "Easy to use, big screen on a small phone.  Clear and great resolution.  Easy to use.",
            "I should have kept my Samsung s10 plus. More features and the phone screen never kept dulling on the s 21 series.",
            "So fast and great screen. Mine had problems with 2 SIMs trying to decide which to use to connect to my galaxy watch 3 and battery life could be better hence 4 rather than 5.",
            "Had Samsung phones for years, the S21 is notably slower than the S10, constant issues, freezes, very very slow camera start up, even struggles with Android Auto in the car. First time I have had to consider to Apple and will regrettably be moving after years on Samsung. Cheaped out on the processor, camera no better than the S10, not worth the upgrade at all, very disappointed.",
            "Cameras are fantastic. Ease of use. More power in one hand than Nasa had to put a man into space",
            "Looks great in Phantom Blue, fast and awesome cameras. 5 stars.",
            "I went from a s10 to an s21 ultra and as much as i am delighted with the camera which is why i went for this particular model there are other features that ruin this product. \nFor example,  you do not receive headphones or a charger cable with this package so already you're forking out more money apon arrival. As for during incoming or outgoing calls. I am constantly putting callers on hold, mute or hanging up on them. There is no option to 'Turn the screen off' during calls to make this stop so it can be highly annoying.\nWould I recommend this phone? \nIf you are a keen photographer then yes buy it, the camera is great, although it still needs some work when it comes to zoom lens etc but that's understandable, only a mobile, not a digital camera.\nAll in all , a disappointment so i give it 3 out of 5",
            "The phone is a fantastic. Honestly no issues with it so far. The battery life is amazing, easily alsts all day. The s pen is fantastic.",
            "I find the ultra great as an all round phone good features and great camera",
            "Having been iPhone slave for last 10 plus years I thought I was superior to all else ! How wrong I was ? Enter samsung and all bow before - s21 ultra is my new mistress - yes the iPhone is top drawer yes its premium! Let's not lie ? But the 21 ultra is the king of all - and the difference is their to see not just for the layman but the pro too..",
            "Phone performance overall is great apart from the struggle when taking photos with the 64Megapixel cam where sometimes it slows down while processing the image. Day time photos are amazing but can't say the same for low light indoor photos which aren't as good as you would expect. Battery life is okay.\nHaptic feedback is great which is very important to me as I am often on silent mode so good vibration motor is a must.",
            "I've changed from an s8 to the s21 \nThe screen colour is washed out. Doesn't matter if you choose vivid. \nBattery life is 18 hours from fully charged, I'd expect more from a 4000amp battery \nThe plastic back feel cheap \nIt still has bixby plugged in everywhere \n\nCamera is great",
            "It's great everything it's an amazing phone but the battery is so rubbish got to charge it 3/4 times a day",
            "Absolutely love it. Million times better tan iphone.",
            "Love the camera, fab photos very clear. Its light in weight, thin in size. Really easy to use, it is a very practical phone",
            "Absolutely awesome but just wished 3d scanner app would be supported for 3d scanning",
            "One of best Samsung galaxy phones Samsung come up with can't wait for the next Samsung phone",
            "Excellent phone. Great battery. Very quick at everything. What more could I want?",
            "Really enjoying my phone had it since release day, easy to use with amazing features and the camera is really, really good.",
            "The phone is great and deos everything it should but the price is disgusting, no headphone jack and especially no expandable memory and no charger.\nPerformance wise no faults and I don't really expect any knowing that samsung is a dependable brand .\nOne other thing I don't like is the position of the buttons as I'm lefthanded and if I need to take a screen shot this can be difficult .",
            "Incredible phone. Worthy upgrade from s10 plus. Light weight. Lovely screen. Camera takes some getting used too. An still gutted about the LED indicator missing from all new edge to edge phones. A solid phone. Reliable. Battery goes full day with moderate usage. Syncs with galaxy watch. More then happy.",
            "The camera is excellent multiple ways to show off your creativity..",
            "Great camera. Easy to handle and navigate. Little bit heavier than old note 10",
            "I like the phone as its similar to the galaxy s range. Runs smoothly, apps work fine. Battery seems to last longer than the other galaxy range.",
            "Lovely screen, fast, brilliant camera, I do find it's way to heavy though and I preferred the screen size of my s10 plus, just stretches videos too much on full screen.",
            "The best phone ever. I just love every detail of it. So so satisfied with my purchase",
            "great phone with slick interface, would recommend for anyone wanted a cool phone and great camera.",
            "This phone is amazing! It is much easier to use for me (66) to keep multi pages open..fab camera as all Samsung phones. I bet there are lots of additions I have not found yet! Sleek, chic colour what's not to like?",
            "What a phone great features stunning camera easy to navigate",
            "Great phone but don't like the buttons all on one side",
            "I love this phone. I normally don't buy phones for the latest trends. I was looking at all the options like iPhone 12 range, one plus and the other s21 and Samsung phone. I see Samsung  have come a long way from the 1st set of mobile phone to a innovater of the industry. Hopefully phones are bought for the right purpose and not as a fashion statement. I take my review title from star wars. And this phone does fight the imperial force of the dark side. Good tech and functionality to boot. May the force be with you.",
            "Stunning display on the screen.. Great for videos plus the camera is amazing. Battery life is very good too",
            "You can tell with the weight that it is a strong phone. Its fast when using it.",
            "Good phone with a couple of disappointing features like with all Samsung phones I've had before this is the battery life, to be honest I was expecting better. Previously I had the S3, S5 and S7 all had lower than expected battery life because of this I went to a Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the battery efficiency was night and day compared to Samsung. I chosen the S21 expecting it to at least be level especially with the new chip but it's not, even after 2 years the Huawei battery can outlast the S21 hence the 3 stars. Performance is great but clearly not an efficient phone when it comes to battery management unlike Huawei. \n\nThe other annoying features is Samsung preinstalling their own version of certain Google apps that you can't uninstall and will never use Please Samsung just stop ramming these down people's throats, it's getting old now.\n\nFeature wish and price point wise the S21 is brilliant apart from the above.",
            "Amazing Phone! Straight out the box the phone is quick, easy and works a dream. Sound quality for music, videos and movies is AMAZING!! I use my phone and Samsung watch 3 for fitness and the connection between both is amazing along with how it monitors everything too. Over all and amazing piece of kit and can't wait to explore and learn more throughout the phone",
            "It's amazing,  the camera is very good..............",
            "This smartphone has everything you want: it has a nice design, it is fast, it takes some exceptional photos and it helps you when you need it as well and maybe better than a laptop.  I am very satisfied with this smartphone.",
            "I love my new phone, with the size being a bit bigger than my S10 it is so much easier for me as I am getting a bit older it is easier for me to see and to type  message's so much easier. It also allows even an amateur like me to take lovely photos and video's.",
            "I love my new phone its lightweight easy to use, camera is brilliant the only thing I don't like is you can't download music tunes from deezer to put as ring tone apart from that I love my phone.",
            "The camera is the main reason you would want this phone, every photo I've taken has came out amazing no matter the subject, the 10x periscope camera allows me focus close up on a subject and keep the quality, video is also the smoothest I've had in a phone. The massive battery in this phone often leaves me with around 45% at the end of the day even with heavy use. The screen is the most colourful and crisp display in any smartphone at the moment and HDR shows on netflix and YouTube look amazing, coming from an iPhone I instantly noticed how smooth and snappy using the phone was, this is partly due to the 120hz display which is huge in comparison to the 60hz display on the iPhone. You will definitely feel the difference.",
            "For a device as expensive as this, you would expect an upgrade. My S10, hell even my S8 had not only a compatible headphone 3.5mm jack but it could read heartbeats through the IR sensors. Upping the price on a phone that has less features and that isn't much of a technical upgrade to previous models? Yikes. I do recommend it because it's a good enough phone, but a downgrade from previous models",
            "Battery doesn't last long.\nOne plus and Huawei have battery battery performance. Would love to swap for one of them.",
            "Great features, it's a shame that even in an official Samsung case the phone develops scratches. Came back to Samsung after leaving once before, was hoping for a top end phone with a great premium feel, but disappointed that both are ruined because of the materials used to build the phone.",
            "I Love everything about the new.phone the  camera and editing features are so much better than any phone I've used before, the speed is impressive and loving the apps. Really Impressed with the Galaxy active 2 watch that I took out with the phone , really chuffed.",
            "The size of the phone, its awesome watching tv shows and films on",
            "There's one thing and one thing only when I'm considering a new phone. The camera setup and the quality of pictures.\n\nThe s21 ultra does pictures like no other currently available to consumers.\n\nIf you're looking for a phone to take the best pictures look no further",
            "Always been a iphone guy then finaly made a change with the s21 ultra and can honestly say best move ever the phone is just so much better than the iphones especially for my use of the phone just an all round great phone and so glad i changed the screen is amazing and the camera too if your thinking of getting one you will not be disappointed",
            "This is the best phone i have ever owned! The battery life is superb and easily lasts all day long, the camera is outstanding and captures great photos and videos, the amoled screen is crisp and bright and there is no problems viewing in bright sunlight. Now Samsung has added the ability to use the s pen is an excellent addition as i have used the s pen with my previous phone the note 10 and it has all the features apart from bluetooth connectivity which will be made available with the upcoming s pen pro",
            "I'm happy that I decided to purchase new Galaxy S21 5G. I'm using this phone over 3 months without any problems. All working good and smooth. I am happy with quality of photos taken by camera.",
            "The picture quality is fantastic but I still need to find out what the phone does in all haven't had much time",
            "Love everything about the phone, the ONLY niggle I have is the platform for the cameras is a bit bulky, but I'd rather have that then lower quality camera so",
            "What we actually need from a phone all under the hood. Great phone processor great display great camera and seriously great battery life which is not so common in todays high end power draining phones",
            "Loving the style, cameras and new features.\nOnly downside for me is the Screenshot action a bit fiddly and taking sine time to master.\nWould also have been nice to have a pen and advice on where to get a decent thick case",
            "All great perfect phone. Very fast. Camera is amazing",
            "Great upgrade from my galaxy note 9, camera is amazing and phone so fast.",
            "Great features, especially the camera. Very happy with this phone.",
            "Over priced \nSlower them Motorola \nFaulty charger \nKeep getting warning on screen device too hot , close extra window.",
            "High tech camera which has proven that you can take a clear picture of the moon.",
            "Amazing cameras, super fast & top quality. It's the best Samsung S series I've ever had (I have had quite a few)",
            "Sleek design, fast and responsive great photo's that are on par with my slr. Totally love this phone, best one I've had from Samsung to date.",
            "I am very happy with the phone overall but i feel like i am using Note 4 because it is OVERHEATING every time i use it for video calls even if i am not charging it at that moment.\nI had to buy a thick cover so i can hold it in my hand every time a have a video conference aspecialy now that you need to use this option...\nOverall the phone is good but this issue drags it down dramatically",
            "Sleek screen touch, clear pictures, packed information, clear call features, background noise cancelling features, big screen",
            "Very nice and sleek phone camera is awesome operating system is smooth and responsive a very Gucci bit of kit",
            "I love the phone, its very fast and screens big. very updated.",
            "It is good\nEasy to use",
            "I've never owned a Samsung Galaxy before so did a lot of research before buying and had my eye on this one for the camera features. It has not let me down. As a photographer this phone is perfect!!! The camera is sensational!! Not only that its one of the easiest phones I've ever used. I still need to properly explore everything but I love everything it has to offer and know there is still so much more to see. I've been raving about it to all my friends.",
            "Really annoys me that the ultra always comes in such bland dull colours and not the same colours as the S21 and s21+",
            "I've had every Samsung galaxy sinse the S5 and can say with confidence this is the best device Samsung has produced which is good because it is vastly better than the S20 ultra. I was close to looking at other brands due to the disappointment but after watching the unpacked event it was clear Samsung had really gone back to the drawing board and produced a piece of art.",
            "Was disappointed to learn that the device lacked a micro sd card slot, lacked a normal audio jack. My last Samsung device came with headphones, plug etc. This didn't have any, not even a plug. \n\nPositives are a slightly better camera \n\nConsidering the price of the device, I would not recommend.",
            "U do not get a proper  USB lead and for the lead u get u havev2 buy a plug",
            "S21ultra extremely fast and its even great with S pen  . Only one down side with this phone not having a Micro sd card slot. So disappointed to Samsung dropped that.",
            "Great device... loving my camera . I couldn't get the Snapdragon888 which I wanted but the Exynose2100 is still Great. Would definitely recommend",
            "This is an amazing piece of tech. It's the best battery ever and actually lasts 2 days till I plug it in on the 2nd night! The camera is limitless and the zoom is out of this world. All in all I rate this handset and all its features with 10 out of 10. Well done samsung",
            "Speed, camera, battery and style color black matt \ndefinitely amazing",
            "The big selling point for this phone was the camera for me. Being self employed I needed a good phone for product photos. I am not disappointed, the camera is amazing and lots of great features. The phone itself is fast and reliable. A full charge will last me a full day and a half. It's great.",
            "Such a great phone. I am so glad I upgraded as this is by far the best phone I have owned. The camera is amazing, the screen is crystal clear and everything is so slick.",
            "I have used S20 5G last year before upgrading to this new S21 5G. I have to admit that Samsungs decisions on design to make price cuts are to the point. For example I never used 1440p resolution on my older phone and plastic back never gave me a cheap feeling.\nThe processor or far more optimised and faster than before.\nThe camera is one of the best, if not the best, out there. Point and shoot always takes remarkable pictures.\nThe only gripe with this phone is it get a bit hot while doing things like video calls.\n\nOver all, this is an easy recommendation for anyone.",
            "The phone over all is fantastic. Brilliant all round. I had the p40 Pro before camera not quite up to that scratch but close enough.",
            "Easy to use , fast and great amount , definitely order again samsung.",
            "I've just come from using an huawei p30 Pro, which I think was a much more of a good looking phone, it had a nice curved screen and a lovely blue alloy back cover also a 50x zoom camera it also was a lot more solid to hold,This new Samsung has a flat screen with I think is dated and also a plastic back cover wich gives it a cheap look.",
            "love the big screen  easy to use has some great features",
            "I had Samsung phones from Note5, S9+, Note 9, S10+ and S20 Ultra. I got to say that this is best phone that Samsung has made. S20 Ultra was the worst. Although S21 ultra lost the microsd support but it has better camera and finish compared to the poor camera and slippery S20 ultra.",
            "Love this phone, easy to use, super quick to set up, camera is unreal.",
            "Nothing better to ask for when you get this phone!",
            "Not what it's made out to be apps keep freezing or crashing",
            "I should have stuck with my S7+.\nI only upgraded because of the apparent camera quality. There's no difference between my S7+ & S21.\nMy partner brought the iPhone 12 mini at the same time & the quality compared to the S21 is incredible.\nI'm very disappointed.\nAs for everything else there is no difference between it & S7+.\nVery disappointed that the face recognition & finger print recognition are both rubbish & 99% of the time I have to use a pin. So really was no point upgrading.\nAgain compared to the iPhone mini it recognises my face straight away, I've never had an issue with the iPhone.\nJust a disappointing phone all round.\nMaybe I was hoping for too much but I thought there would be at least some improvements compared to a 5 year phone.",
            "Large screen helps you see everything camera is amazing fast design and durable",
            "I love thks device. Feels good in hand. Size is perfect. Camera quality is great. Back is made of plastic. But it doesn't really feels like plastic. But I think it would be great if it has glass back.",
            "all perfect.imagine i amazing,speed is good..love s21 ultra 5g",
            "Fingerprint sensor is more than a little temperamental on both my s21 ultra and my wife's s21. Position is ok (actually preferred the one on the back like on my note 9) it just refuses to recognise my print several times a day.",
            "I had to upgrade as my not 9 android version for the apps i need were no longer available to update unfortunately the s21 ultra has less than half the features headphone jack i use daily for work but now i have to use Bluetooth ones another thing to charge no expandable storage screen not as good and fingerprint scanner very hit and mis, no charger in the box have to buy a new one as passed my old phone and charger to family I'm very disappointed with this years phones from Samsung I've had them since the first galaxy, wish Samsung would stop taking features away especially for the amount they charge!!!",
            "Moved from apple to Samsung after ten years and as much as I agree with the recycling of old accessories it has been a nightmare using the wireless charger in the car any time I need to charge my phone",
            "I had the standard S20 previously, i was frustrated with the poor battery and the screen quality Compared to my colleague with an iPhone. So decided to bite the bullet give the ultra a go, and oh boy am I super glad I did. I can now get 14-16 hours out of my battery, incredible, I'm not an average user either, I game, research, spend an hour on my lunch watching videos. The screen quality, just knocks the S20 out the park, I didn't think the quality could get better as I'd never seen a working ultra to me, that was the best I'd get from Samsung. The screen vibrancy the depth just incredible. I've not played around too much with the camera, I'm messed around with the zoom, like any zoom on any camera unless you have super steady hands, honestly not worth it. But that being said, I've not used it in an outside environment and so it maybe better. The only thing I don't like, the colour and design, I ordered silver, well to me its pink... I don't like the camera cut out either but again, this doesn't impact what I use the phone for this is me being truly picky.\n\nOverall 10/10 if you are thinking between this and the 12 Pro max, this is as good, if not better in my personal opinion.",
            "Great phone and wish I could take full advantage of all the great things it can do. But there is a distinct lack of how to information",
            "Love this device. I got it with my upgrade plan. But because my upgrade was after the offer of  free headphones I missed on the deal. Which is a massive disappointment for me. Other than that I have not a single negative thing to say about the device. Looking forward to the S22 Ultra now.",
            "This is a stunning phone, really fast, looks great, feels great, and the camera is stunning, I couldn't be happier. Highly recommended.",
            "If you want a phone that can do it all and more without compromising features or quality, then Galaxy S21 Ultra is a phone for you. Other manufacturers will sell you intangible privacy propaganda in a limited sterile ecosystem. Samsung recognizes that its customers need an actual smartphone that will effortlessly learn how you use your phone and adapt to your lifestyle, therefore giving you unlimited possibilities in an ecosystem that makes sense to the user, not to company's financial gain. The amazing display will immerse you into beautiful One UI that's a pleasure to interact with, while crystal clear stereo speakers envelop you into content you're watching with it's expansive sound stage. I would not consider giving this amount of money to any other company except Samsung. With their amazing customer support as well as frequent software updates, I will be using this device for years to come causing envy all around everywhere I go.",
            "When your phone is an all in one of everything you need, you'd be as excited as I am. The camera quality is absolutely excellent for my food photography too. I don't have to keep setting up a dslr anymore.",
            "So smooth and fast. Had the s21 but it didn't compare to the ultra.",
            "It's very good phone with more features than other phones. Very good camera. Not happy with battery life. Should have been 4500 mAh instead of ૪૦૦૦.",
            "This phone is pretty awesome. It looks good, it's light, it's fast and the camera is incredible. The display looks great,unlike previous phones, I've had no issue with the biometric login on this phone, as yet. \n\nWould definitely recommend this phone to anyone.",
            "Good phone but doesn't really have the wow factor, just feels like every other Samsung. Oh and very expensive.",
            "Such a fun great phone to use and super happy I chose to get one",
            "Phone is easy to use the first thing you'll notice is the quality of the screen its nothing short of superb. The camera quality is great. My only issue is the keyboard doesn't go to the bottom of the screen, not sure if that's something I can edit within the settings though but all in all that's a very small issue. I moved from Huawei and was concerned about battery life, whilst I do get a little less screen time with my daily usage so far its not been a major concern and has lasted most days without needing a charge. It looks like samsung have won me back and when my contracts up again I'll be looking at their next device.",
            "My love s21 ultra\nmy photos are perfect every day, i love my galaxy",
            "This is my first Samsung in about a decade as I was previously a Huawei user and before that, Apple. I have to say the user interface is super easy to use and to understand and the connection is immaculate. The only issues that I have aren't necessarily a problem with the phone itself but the compatability with Apple Apps and Apps.in general. It's clear to me as an avid user of apps such as TikTok and Snapchat that our quality of camera and even some traits of the app in general are wiped out because we are Android and not Apple. This is highly disappointing and hopefully soon we will be able to use apps such as Snapchat with the full force of our Android power as I strongly believe Android is way better than Apple in basically every aspect.",
            "The camera's are absolutely magic photos and video are the best out there.There is just so much about this phone that makes it more than a phone it a mini computer which I now hardly use. And the way this just connects with so many things, TV ,Computer , Echo with ease blows Apple out the water I would never go back to Apple again.\nKeep it up Samsung",
            "The Ultra 5G phone has amazing battery life, amazing screen and camera.  It's a shame that Samsung doesn't supply a charger.",
            "5G enabled, camera is out of this world. Fantastic memory storage, looks good. My favourite Samsung phone so far.",
            "The best design samsung ever made for the galaxy series",
            "That cameras are amazing good quality photos, s-pen support is great to, using note 10+ s-pen on Samsung galaxy s21 ultra, get the 256gb as 128gb will be filled up quickly with 4k videos and photos, music and other bits will run out of space, recommend 256gb base as this will give you plenty of space for all what you want on the phone. The s21 ultra is the best phone out today and I've been happy with my 256gb would have fild up the 128gb one so glad I got 256gb as I taken lots of videos and photos, screen is amazing, fits in the hand well, just a perfect phone. No sd card but supports external hard drive and memory stick as a way to backup your personal stuff. If any thing if you're thinking 128gb is enough it's not, should start with 256gb and that's the version you should buy",
            "I like the phone and the camera works better than the S20 ultra, but the phone overall is very sluggish and slow, not what you would expect from a 1300£ phone. I have the 512gb version. I have my favorite game that I can not play on this phone as is to sluggish. The game works better on my old samsung S9 plus. It gets a bit better if I turn off the animations but still not good enough. I have done a factory reset but still the same.",
            "This new S21 5G Ultra is the best phone I have ever owned.  The camera is beyond belief with so many ways to get the image you want or need.\nIt's fast, with good memory content, so no extra microsd card needed. \nAs far as I am concerned,  this is the best camera phone so far, by far. Thank you Samsung.",
            "Great handset. love it bit on the heavy side that's the only negative but for the quality of the phone I'm more than happy and impressed. I think you could give more information on how to use the features and how to get the best out of a high tech phone like my Samsung galaxy s21 ultra \"it really is a nice bit of kit\" hats of to you Samsung.",
            "This phone constantly crashes. Samsung blame 3rd party apps, that come from the play store that they recommend. They say there's nothing wrong with it at all. It must be my imagination.\nTrying to speak with someone whose first language is English is near impossible. I'd leave well alone this is maybe my 6th samsung phone and unfortunately my last",
            "At this price not having a charger is an insult to the buyer",
            "This model replaced my S10 ultra. It exceeds my expectations and is worthy of the praise from around the world.",
            "So impressed with the S21 Ultra, I've never gone for a latest edition of a phone but I'm so happy I did. \n\nThe phone itself preforms amazingly. The phone is so responsive, quick to react to your touch and just so smooth with it. \nThe camera is honestly out of this world for a phone camera and one reason I actually brought the phone. Only downside was my selfies are now so good its bad, basically catfished myself through my previous phones bad camera quality... Only downside relating to the camera is Snapchat but that is at a fault of their own and not with Samsung, if you take a video you'll see how bad the quality is. The video will be grainy and lags but you know your camera is better than what it produces via snapchat.\nBattery life is incredible it lasts me all day and if I forget to charge it at the end of the day i'll still wake up the next morning with enough charge. \nFeatures to the phone haven't blown me away but thats because they're familiar I've used a Samsung for both my personal and work phone for the last 5 years but do find on the S21 ultra the features run smoother due to the great performance of the phone and you can use everything longer without draining battery life. \nFinally... lets just appreciate how beautiful the design of this phone is. I don't think i'd give up on the curved display and so glad this version of the S21 range offers that. I usually go for a black phone but due to it being out of stock from the place I brought the phone I had to go with sliver but I don't regret it because it looks so smart.\n\nSo happy with this phone- would highly recommend as it is worth the price you pay.",
            "Nice compact sized phone works fantastic nice looking and sleek",
            "Camera and general speed of phone good. A big move up.",
            "I absolutely love my new phone its a lot better than the S10+ with better quality and photos",
            "I chose this this phone because its the best one on the market right now for all round performance speed great camera that takes brilliant photos and selfie, long battery life comfort in the hand just a fantastic phone that does everything you'd expect from Samsung A***",
            "I love taking pictures and videos and this phone makes it so easy and I can do more than one type of photo and videos.",
            "It's actually a bit too big and the camera sticks out to much",
            "Nice well built mobile, I'm I'm heavy user and the battery doesn't last as long as stated, huawei p30 Pro lasted longer, and small battery size",
            "For about a week until battery optimisation completed, I could not use WhatsApp regardless of all the settings I turned off about battery optimisation and so on.",
            "The camera is such good quality , I'm not much of a photographer  but now I think I'll be snapping every beautiful scene I see ,",
            "I've had this ultra 5g for little over 2 months and I love it, it does everything I need and so so much more. It feel quality, it works like quality, it is quality. I upgraded from the s20u to the 21u and it felt like a big upgrade in so many ways. The cameras are I'm my opinion the best on the market, they work flawlessly and the picture/videos they produce are nothing less than awesome. I highly recommend this unit and I hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine.",
            "Lightning fast with a supreme high quality screen with super bright display. Very easy to see when outside, can't wait to be able to use it on holiday abroad as used to be difficult in direct sunlight at times to see the screen. Super smooth and fast screen scrolling and game play further enhance the user experience. \nThe best part though, the camera! Blows the fruit phone out of the water and truly amazing detail in any light. I tried a photo in a dark room with only a glow from the street coming though the blind. My eyes could not see much but after a short pause while the image was processed, a photo appeared with lots of detail visible. An extreme example but goes to show the power of the camera.",
            "The Samsung galaxy s21 ultra 5g has to be the best smartph I've used in the past four years, the streaming capabilities, audio, video quality is amazing, the refresh rate puts it up there with dedicated gaming phones for mobile gaming, the cameras take some small getting used to but once you do you get all the functions of a DSLR in your pocket ( a large pocket but a pocket non the less), the battery life is actually rather great for how powerful the phone is.",
            "Been with Samsung since the very beginning of smart phones and as always they deliver to my expectations and beyond. Team Samsung forever!",
            "Ever since the original Oneplus, I have been an ardent fan, and have owned no other phone, I most recently bought the Oneplus 8 pro (largely for the charging speed, and wireless charging), and assumed that I would of been buying the Oneplus 9 right now, but in many ways the phone was a downgrade.\nSince they left their original ethos of a flagship product for a budget price, and changed to a flagship product for a flagship price, I may as well just buy the flagship phone I wanted in the first place. \nI will confess, Samsung (and almost every major phone manufacturer) needs to up their game, and improve their charging speeds, with wired charging, running at half the speed of the last generations wireless charging, it does not take a genius to say that there's a problem here.\nCharging aside, I'm loving the phone, the S21 Ultra is brimming with quality, and the Samsung ecosystem, with Bixby, and the added connection to my galaxy watch 3 are all unexpected bonuses. \nKeep up the good work guys.",
            "The camera is fantastic, the clarity and detail within photographs is amazing. I love that I can use an s-pen with the S21 Ultra, it's a really useful extra, particularly as I use a Galaxy tab s6 to create digital illustration. I love it.",
            "It very good for recording video and photos I preferre this mobile phone",
            "S21 Ultra has not disappointed at all! Ideal for playing high performance games, general browsing. It takes fantastic photos as, considering I temporarily jumped across to the note 20 Ultra, I immediately noticed the tweaks in the camera focusing and stabilisation. I have owned every Samsung since the S3 and they have got better and better. Whoever opts for the iPhone 12 series over the Samsung seriously needs to consider seeing a doctor!!! I've attached a few photos taken with the s21 Ultra",
            "The s21 ultra 5g is a great phone ,I had the s20 ultra 5g before and found the battery gets hot but on the s21 ultra does not have that problem , and the overall performance of the s21 is great",
            "I would like to say my bet on buying S21 Ultra instead of waiting for Oneplus 9pro was successful as I believe that S21 Ultra has upper hand in many aspects compared to Oneplus be it the latest OS and security patch or camera performance. Samsung also has an eco system which has a range of products which are great compared to other companies.\n\nOnly Negative I think is that they should have a vertical scroll option in the new UI update as it makes more sense to see the beautiful 120hertz in action. Also the charging speed from wired charger could be better as rest of the competition is providing minimum of 50 Watts charging.",
            "Tried again the newest iPhone, Google and Huawei. Samsung blows them all away. It has a better zoom than my 70mm-300mm camera lens (which makes sense but it still baffles me!). That being said, I find the 100x zoom hard to use if you want to take a photo of a still object but if a bird, for example, flies into the shot it messes it all up and its hard to regain, even with a tripod. I usually find the 30x zoom being sufficient enough. Overall, you will use the camera to death- make sure you get the biggest GB possible. I've have the 128gb zoom and had the phone 2 months and used the data already. I am now backing everything up to make room but besides the point. Great phone, worth the money.",
            "The perfect phone need I say more. I don't know what else to say",
            "Very good device, a solid camera, display and battery life. Happy with my purchase",
            "As above. The new camera is superb. Only thing I will say is it is INCREDIBLY fragile. I am already on my second phone, as the first one was written off by a less than three foot drop the same day I got it. Thank GOD it was insured for damage.",
            "Very satisfied meets all the requirements I expected",
            "This phone is great. It's smooth and responsive. \nCannot fault it except for the screen covering It's already peeling at the corner after 2 months.",
            "Photo quality is top notch, good responsive screen and the new Bluetooth features are brilliant, alongside excellent steam connectivity with Kishi.",
            "I am amazed at the quality of just about everything this phone does. One criticism is when on hold during a phone call, the screen blanks out and tapping the phone to wake it up can disconnect you.",
            "Best samsung phone ever a lot of features works so fast no lag at all",
            "This has got to be the best phone iv had and I have had a lot apple,Huawei,LG, Nokia etc I did the upgrade from my s20 ultra didn't think it would have been much better boy was I wrong  I also got the buds and tag free because I pre ordered it to be honest not used the tag as yet but the buds sound amazing which I use on my tab s7+ as well",
            "What a great phone the S21 is so far the best in my time. Keep up the good service and work Samsung.",
            "Wow what can I say,I have always had a Samsung but this is the best phone by far,I use my phone about 16hrs a day,the battery lasts all day.which is great,there is nothing a single thing wrong with this phone (in my opinion).10-10",
            "The camera is amazing I love how much detail it capture the single shoot mode that takes load of different shoots and angles is great.",
            "Samsung have done a great job with this unit (S21 ultra) and it deserves 5☆ but there are a couple of things I'd like to see on the flagship:\n1) Weight and thickness could do with been reduced.\n2) More options in handset colour / finish would be nice.\n3) I'd like to see a panoramic night mode setting.\nStill the best phone ever made.....so far!",
            "I love the film of this phone, I have the S21 Ultra 256g! Lots of storage space, great capabilities on camera, nice weight to phone too, lovely back colour. The only thing is I wish it came with the S-pen other than that,  it would have ticked all boxes. Still love it",
            "Super phone all the bells and whistles camera is amazing.The only bad point is i wasnt able to get thr free earbuds when the phone comes with no earphones.",
            "Upgraded from my Samsung note 8 and have not regretted it. The camera is incredible, I use the macro function alot. Paired with the Samsung Pro ear buds and I can listen to music with no interruptions from my noisy family. The screen is beautiful with great colours and brightness. This makes for a great hand held gaming unit which I use regularly with xbox game pass and nvidias geforce Now.",
            "I use to always go for a sony phone till about 4 years ago,  when I changed to Samsung oh wow the best thing I done in a long time I've got s21 ultra now just amazing so made up with it",
            "Best on the market, delightful display perfect for binging your favourite shows. Incredible camera, impeccable performance.",
            "Great phone, had some software issues but after some updates all seems sorted. The use of stylus/pen is quite handy. Also, excellent main camera.",
            "First phone I've had that i can see the screen in sunlight. The battery is so much better than last phone (S10), definitely faster as well. Can't believe the zoom on the camera, so far its a great step forward from the S10",
            "I have been using Huawei's for a few years but the S21 Ultra was too good to pass up. So far this phone lives up to the hype! The screen is phenomenonal, the camera is phenomenal, and the overall experience with this phone has been a delight. It helps me keep my life organised, and makes my photo editing a lot easier!",
            "The phone is great, fast, good battery life and the features and Samsung community(1st time having a samsung) is great. Not 5 stars because I find that the face recognition is not as fast or accurate as other phones I have tried.",
            "Not used my phone yet but just by holding my s21 ultra you can tell it is well designed and the best samsung yet",
            "I am impressed with the 21 Ultra but there does seem to be some stability issues. Some apps that worked flawlessly on my 9+ struggle on the 21. I find myself having to restart much more than with my 9+",
            "I previously had the S10 and purchasing the s21 ultra was definitely the right move. Love everything about this phone from the amazing camera and the size in my hand. Been a Samsung user for a long time and this phone is definitely one of the best I have had.",
            "This phone has been a long time coming, I I have avoided the S20 ultra due to what I could only describe as a 'lack of customer insight, and over  confidence in what the phone could offer. The s21 Ultra rectifys any and all S20 Ultra faults. Personally this is the only phone that has rekindled my love of taking photographs.",
            "I am loving it, like completely...I can finally click the moon and that's something I've always wanted. Always used one plus but after this current release and after using their top end device, I dropped the plan of using it forever. Samsung has surely nailed the game, and definitely defines premium in all possible ways.",
            "The camera quality and features are astronomical,  loading speeds for games and apps and also the screen quality, two downsides are my volume buttons are getting stiff and the phone didn't come with a charging brick",
            "Not a good phone if I play on a game for about 10 minutes the phone gets red hot. Takes nearly 2 hours to charge and only last for a day. And comes with no charger or headphones",
            "Everything works better than expected. I never worry about losing battery life and its great fun in all aspects. Camera is brilliant and everything else it offers is right on point.",
            "Out of all the phones ive had this one is best I upgraded from Samsung Galaxy S10 in February the battery is amazing on Samsung galaxy s21 ultra that have would highly recommended it",
            "Finding new features each day. the camera is excellent.  The screen is brilliant and the colours fantastic.",
            "Had this phone for coming up to two weeks now and it's really impressing in every way I use it for. I definitely feel I have made the purchase worth it. Here are some of the reasons why:\n\n• The camera: Excellent quality videos and pictures, stunning night mode also. It's very versatile and never fails to impress me! I have found the ultra-wide incredibly useful when taking photos and videos, and the quality across the whole picture is consistent in this mode.\n\n• Battery life: Even with a lot of use, the battery has easily lasted me the whole day, and this is without having to use power-saving mode or having to turn off other power-hungry features.\n\n• Display: The large screen has a great display (despite only being a 1080p display, I don't notice a difference from my previous S9's QHD display) which is very good for watching video services such as Youtube on, and the 120hz refresh rate is silky smooth when scrolling or changing between apps.\n\nThese are the main reasons for me, but this phone is an impressive all-rounder for me. I would definitely reccommend it to anyone wishing to upgrade.",
            "I like everything about this phone. \nBest screen ever\nFluid \nBest build ever\nGood battery life\nExcellent camera",
            "Previously had an Android phone way back when, and regretted every minute, so went to apple. As things progressed and I had more and more apple phones I decided that they are all the same no matter how \"newer\" they get, which is okay I just fancied trying something new for a chang...so gave this a try and in loving every minute of it - cannot put it down. \nIt's stunning display, you can customise and personalise pretty much everything. The camera is just phenominal, the speed, battery life, I haven't got a single bad word to say yet other than the screen protectors. They are very flimsy and if you get a glass one the finger print recognition is reduced. So I have yet to find something I think will protect it without adding a lot of bulk to the phone. That being said I have one of the flimsy ones on at the minute and I'm being careful with it so I don't actually know if it will.protect the screen or not. Only time will tell.\nI thought I'd have to give it back and go back to apple but I have to say I'm sold on Android now, they have come on in leaps and bounds.",
            "This S21 Ultra is a fantastic phone will a brilliant camera with multiple settings and great results.\nAlso HDR quality video.\nHope they can include a Micro SD card port in future phones from Samsung.",
            "Great phone, wonderful camera. Love the layout and ease of use",
            "Overall excellent  love the macro setting in the camera awsome phone speakers are great so I would  say excellent sound quality  and very fast my only fault  is I have loads of pictures  and music  so very disappointed  that they removed the micro sd \nthe sd card add in is no more that is disappointing the phone is such a excellent  experience  to use \nOverall  99.99%  not 100% because  of the lost micro sd  function",
            "The signal is terrible I only get 5g if I'm close to a mast otherwise its 3g and doesn't work even with WiFi I can't use this phone in certain areas of my house when my old phone was fine",
            "Quick processor,  nice looking phone, not too much different from my old s9, battery is OK expected it to last abit longer. Decent camera.",
            "Absolutely love everything on this phone. After upgrading from a galaxy s10 this is 10x bettet. The 100x zoom on the camera is good for taking pictures of the moon. Yes the moon lol.",
            "Great mobile, camera is great and battery life will last all day. I just love this mobile.",
            "I didn't explore it enough yet, but it's take nive photos",
            "Camera is very good,gameplay on highest levels,battery last very long",
            "My old phones battery and performance was awful and the phone got hot trying to do the simplest things. The S21 is such a jump up, it's amazing in every way and the battery easily lasts a day on normal usage. Couldn't recommend it enough",
            "Being an advid apple user for many years changing my my to a Samsung s21 was the the smartest move I've done ,just a wonderful phone",
            "5 stars all round probably the last phone I'll ever need",
            "It's a great phone camera is fantastic, it's just a pleasure to own love it",
            "The camera on this is so much better, the fingerprint sensor is so much more responsive and changing apps and websites are so much quicker.",
            "Smooth device does everything you need and more..apart from the c type jack. I use my phone while playing and talking with friends for hours (4+) so this makes ear buds pointless. I've tried 2 c type connections but voice quality hasn't improved. \n\nBRING BACK JACK!",
            "I like the overall look of the device. Performance is great too but the only issue is it heats up pretty quickly especially when you are using the camera, it doesn't take more than 5 minutes to become hot.",
            "This is my 1st Galaxy S21 Ultra ever and I absolutely love it. My wife has always had samsung phones and I must say the one thing on samsung phones the volume is loud which I love so much. I had a google pixel 3 before this one and all though the phone was good the volume was not all that and so its  Features. But on this galaxy s21 ultra the features are just amazing. I would recommend to anyone to get one of these it's just simply fantastic.",
            "The phone is working as expected, with great photographs, smooth screen transitions,  beautifull colours.  Multi tasking is a dream.  I am using all Samsung features, as opposed to Google.   I like Bixby and haven't had any problems with it not working. I use Samsung Routines for just about anything I can think of, thereby making the most out of the battery life and various functionalities. \nAll in all superb phone.",
            "Very slow for a brand new phone would have expected more",
            "I've owned most brands of phone and no-one of them have come close to what my s21 ultra has. The cameras on this phone are superb. They offer exactly what I'm looking for, zoom, macro and quality. No longer do I want just that little bit more from a phone. Well done Samsung. The total and complete package.",
            "Everything this is easily by far the best phone I've ever had",
            "S21 ultra is all time great, never used a phone as good as this.",
            "Great phone,  unfortunately missed out on the accessory off :(",
            "I've had the s21 Ultra for just over a month now. I usually get the latest phone when I'm out of contract from the previous phone. My last phone was a p30 Pro. In comparison the Samsung is probably better on the whole although from a camera point the p30 Pro could take photos as quick as pressing the button whereas the Samsung seems to take it's time. I also have issues with the device being hot  a quick Google seems to be a common issue. Literally 5-10 minutes using the camera and it's too hot to touch sometimes.",
            "Great phone only downfall it heats up immense while playing games, i really do love the camera I have always wanted to take pictures of the moon and was totally amazed at the result.   Sharing pics of the moon taken by my old phone Samsung s20 ultra and new Samsung s21 ultra 5g, blue pic was taken with Samsung s20 ultra and the black with s21 ultra the different is incredible.",
            "Absolutely brilliant, can not fault this phone. Great camera. Great all round.",
            "Love it great camera amazing quality lovely looking phone",
            "New style good result as before.\nI am happy to use this with full confidence.\nRecommended to others.",
            "Apart from some over heating when I do certain things like launch big games etc I love my phone and couldn't be happier.",
            "Camera is awesome!! Also very works faster. Little bulky though",
            "It has everything that I need and more. So easy and very useful for work and pleasure.",
            "Nice phone. Missed the bit about no SD card which was a differentiator between Samsung and iPhone.",
            "A great phone to have with a super fast processor and stacks of memory, excellent build quality and fantastic design. A battery that does last all day with constant use, excellent upgraded camera and video recording, a truly 2021 phone that leaves the competition far behind,",
            "I dont like it it looks very very  similar with s20 and s10",
            "Best phone every just don't drop it",
            "First time samsung has improved camera next level and as always display is outstanding,\nPerformance of this phone is 10 out of 10 .\n\nI am so much impressed with camera zoom and it's quality",
            "The camera, picture quality and video quality is outstanding and as I have the iPhone 12 for work, I  say it performance is better that the iPhone.\n\nProcessing is seamless and no lag experienced in swapped between apps etc.\n\nBiggest downside is not having expandable memory, which would have made this perfect.",
            "My battery doesn't 10-12 hours.  Other than that am okay with every other thing",
            "Haven't owned a samsung in a while, glad I made the switch back. Great design, amazing camera",
            "The speaker is horrible. This is my second replacement with the same problem. Sounds like it has broken speakers.",
            "Great phone however alot of features have not been realised on the snapdragon model. I.e. chat feature between Samsung phones also unable to ever get a 5G signal.",
            "Spectacular camera and user-friendly interface, love the customizations, checks all the boxes!",
            "Has a great camera.\nSuper resolution.\nFast processor.\nGreat speakers.\nJust all round a great phone.",
            "There isnt anything I don't love about this phone. After having a Samsung S7 edge, s8 and a s10 the s21 ultra 5g is amazing. Camera is beyond what I thought. Size and screen is amazing. Free live buds are amazing and great. Works so well with my galaxy watch. The speed and functions it has just work.",
            "Well I m not very good to review products but this phone is just the best phone I ever had. \nIt's quick and powerful. \nGreat design.. a day to day personal assistant.",
            "The phone is ok. I thought is more then that, but after one month, not so excited as before. Battery performance is not that ok and on YouTube after couple of minutes is starts to heat up",
            "So the Samsung galaxy s21 ultra 5g is a nice big phone. Photos are brilliant however night mode needs work. And it always disconnecting from WiFi.",
            "Works way better than my previous phone and holds its charge very well.",
            "I used the Samsung Upgrade Programme to upgrade from my S20 Ultra to my current S21 Ultra 512gb and haven't looked back since. All the teething issues with the S20 Ultra's phone have been sorted and this phone is just a joy with so many incredible features....too many to list along with the absolutely fantastic display and design! My only recommendation would be to still have the option of removable storage as a back up for some. Other than that, this phone is simply unbeatable. Well done Samsung",
            "Everything about is great. I really like the speed, that the phone doesnt heatup\n\nReally like the graphics on gamestore",
            "Very happy with the S21 5G\nIt's fast and very smooth\nAlso we'll built its a solid phone",
            "Just one flaw .Battery improved but still not in market competition.",
            "Is the best mobile phone for my needs and budget.Phenomenal battery life and stylish look. Excellent 120Hz display,it's amazing bright and colorful.Camera produces the best photos in the world.",
            "Overheating on multi screen e.g WhatsApp video call overlaying game. Phone just says 'closing window to prevent overheating'",
            "I got this phone because of spen features which are great just wish spen came in the box",
            "Not a huge fan of the look of the camera housing but with my case on its ok. \nScreen is superb.\nBattery life for me is nearly 2 days so I'm happy with that. \nOnly down side I can think of is the fingerprint reader sometimes failing to recognise multiple times in a row. Oh, and the price is a little over the top. I would never have bought it I hadn't had a £300 gift voucher to go towards it. \nOther than that in very pleased with it.",
            "Firstly 8 didn't want a larger phone than my S10+ but I wanted upgraded features so I tried the S21U. The screen wasn't much different to my S10+ but it was much faster and camera much improved. However the phone was huge and far too big to use effectively and carry in my pocket so it was returned and swapped for the S21. I've barely noticed the drop to Fhd and the camera is great but lacks the 10x zoom. I wish when buying a galaxy S product we could have all the top features across all the S phones, and not just the ultra model. If I wanted a reduced spec I'd have bought an A model phone. Not everyone wants a huge device. The S21U is well made and looks lovely but are the 120hz screen and camera really worth the price over the S21, not for me.",
            "Vibrant colours!  If I had in issue the battery life is not quite as long aa I was led to believe by the advertising.",
            "Moving up from the A70 to this was a big step, even though I loved the A70. This just has all the things I used and enjoyed about that phone but better and quicker.\nLove how I don't have to worry about anything working. It all just does. All apps, websites, accessories work a treat with no problems.\nSound and picture quality are fantastic.\nPerformance when doing anything is amazing.\nLove my new device.\nOnly one hiccup so far but I'm sure this will be resolved with a future software update. I get a notable lag on the camera when taking pictures but not so bad that it causes me to worry or make it unusable.\nAlso wish they had left the expandable storage as this was a major bonus on my previous device. But I suppose with all the other upgrades I get with the s21, I can't have everything.\nGreat phone, easy to use and I would recommend to anyone looking for a flagship.\nGreat support from Samsung too if needed. Happy customer all round.",
            "I exchanged my S20 Ultra for an S21 Ultra; so far very happy. Battery life is better than my S20, I get over 2 days of use on average; frequent video calls can reduce this, but even then the battery is ok. Charging is quick using my old S20 charger. Camera is OK, not tested it to its full potential, but I'm  a DSLR user, so my phone camera is never my first choice. Overall I'm very happy and have no regrets at upgrading.",
            "Overall happy with my new phone. The only disappointment is phone arrived with no charger or headphones, and a lead that doesn't fit any charger in my house.",
            "The cameras and style are great I love taking videos doing slow motions",
            "After one month of use I can tell that I love new s21 Ultra! Everything in this phone is wonderful :)",
            "Easy to navigate. Photographs are Ace\nConnection is really fadt",
            "A lot of money for nothing. The advertising hype is just Hype!",
            "My new Galaxy S21 has surpassed my expectations for it's processing speed and smooth handling. Despite loosing a few features from my previous S9 the bigger screen and battery make this a very good home/work phone. Very impressed overall",
            "The camera in this phone is awesome. Battery life is quite good. Once fully charged,you don't have to worry looking for the charger for the next 24 hours.",
            "Had it just over a month grand phone for the money there's only one thing I miss 1440p display",
            "This is the best phone I ever had. Previously I was using S9+, but this phone is just amazing. Amazing camera quality, amazing performance. I really really recommend this phone. The best phone ever created. When I compared to my friends new iPhone, Samsung was too far ahead! This is truly best phone ever created!! Thank You Samsung!!",
            "Love this phone and it's cameras abs other features",
            "This is the first samsung galaxy I have had in ages and I am vary impressed I would recommend and buy again in 2 years :)",
            "I am so happy cuz i bougt it. Best phone i ever use. Love it!",
            "Upgraded from the S9+. Best decision I've made regarding a phone. Love it. Just having some camera issues.",
            "It's a great phone but wish they would allow you to customize the buttons and other things more.",
            "Only upgraded because my s10+ had broke.\nHave to say I'm not overly impressed with th s21 ultra.  Much prefer the s10+\nPreferred the lay out to the s10 aswel,I keep thinking the volume button is the lock button on this one since all the buttons are on the same side now.\nAnd what is going on with the charger?? No plug or ear phones....\nWhaaaat",
            "Love the phone, been with apple for years, finally switched over. My only downside is I wish it had MQA for music listening,  even though I use an external dac that I can do this through wired headphones plugged into USB,( using audio pro app). It would be just a good option for the phones internal dac to do this also.",
            "I am loving the crisp and clear screen and the photos are beautiful it's lovely looking phone just look at this photo of my dog",
            "All in all its a very good phone. Love the camera.",
            "Such a great phone with so many great features. Having always used apple products I am now converted.",
            "perfect phone with perfect camera super fast I really love it",
            "I changed from an iPhone 11 Pro Max, to the S21 Ultra 5G, been loving it so far, no issues, the transition was seemless, definitely one of the better Android phones u have used, and my first Samsung since the Tocco Lite. No regrets. Only downside is that some apps don't function the same they did on my iPhone, but that's more of a development issue than a phone issue.",
            "After moving to iphone for several years, I switched back to Android a little over 2 years ago, and haven't looked back since, I've always had Samasing as my first choice on android devices ever since way back before flip and slider phones, and they haven't failed to amaze me since.\nThe S21 has been a fantastic addition to the Samsung family, with fantastic speeds, the ability to handle vigorous usage and still returning great battery life, as well as never faltering or lagging, or really any kind of signs that the phone is unable to keep up. Recording and pictures are exceptionally great, whilst basic functions as always are always easy to navigate.\n\nOverall I'm glad to of upgraded to the S21, and would highly recommend it to anyone",
            "Very nice phone l very liked nice nice              nice         nice     nice",
            "This phone for me is fantastic, I really love everything about it, my only complaint is. Why don't let me use all lens in pro mode? \nPlease Samsung unlock this,  is very simple, let me use all lens in pro mode.  Please please please make it a priority, unlock all camera use in pro mode .then will be 5 start .",
            "This phone constantly disconnects from WiFi and then cannot connect again saying 'couldn't get ip address' (and no it's not my router as everything else stays connected).\nWhe are Samsung going to sort this out? As I know it's not only my phone it happens to...very disappointed in the WiFi connection!!!!",
            "The phones performance is definitely the best I have used to date. But the cameras are out of this world. I have taken a few tricky shots and it's given great results.",
            "I am new to Samsung after being with HTC for many years. I have had this phone since it was released and I am very pleased that I made the switch the the S21 ultra, I loving the camera and it features, but also the smoothness of the application and the software is amazing.\n\nThe points were it lose marks for me Is that I am only able to edit with certain filters on my camera gallary and not on the photo gallary that is on the home screen. \nI would also recommend that samsung invest in a video editing app.",
            "Taking put audio-jack and SD card slot and going silent or under the radar with it something not very pleasant for the Samsung community. Now I'm forced to buy wireless audio devices which doesn't provide the greatest connnectivity and audio quality...I'm forced into bying services such as clour or phone upgrades when I run out of storage room? Consumerism at it's best: connectivity in exchange for flexibility, service quality... Life-time loyalty is a bad deal for Samsung.",
            "The device is great but cannot order my free buds on line as doesn't recognise my imie number. Also every phone number I've been given is wrong or no longer active",
            "I don't know what the fuss was about the Samsumg S21. There is nothing spectacular about this device.  Not different to other Samsung devices.",
            "Perfect size, i like curved edges on S21 ultra. I noticed screen is flat on Galaxy S21 plus compare to Galaxy S21 Ultra\nLove the photo qualities.",
            "Doesn't come with a charger plug, apparently to be more eco... Except you then have to spend more money to buy a new plug to even be able to use the phone.. Not even turned it on, not much point when it'd be dead before I got the plug through. Rather stupid. Sending the phone back, will stick with my huawei.",
            "Great phone only down side is that I have to fork out for earphones as I missed out on the buds",
            "like always amazing phone move frome sansung note 9 to samsung galaxy S21 ultra was easy. fully recommended",
            "The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G is amazing! I love all of the new features on it. The cameras look amazing and makes my social media look really professional. The screen is big witch is great and gives me a bigger viewing space for YouTube and Netflix. Also, the screen being 120Hz is great as everything is nice and smooth. The audio on the smartphone speakers sound great, the addition of Dolby Atmos makes it perfect. The battery life is excellent. Overall the smartphone is absolutely excellent!!",
            "I love this phone its got everything like 6 cameras pictures r amazing games r amazing and it's so easy to use best samsung ever to hit the market",
            "I cant fault this phone. Been the best one I have had and the camera is amazing.",
            "i love the camera and system however the phone over heats alot",
            "Extremely disappointed that my s21 doesn't have a plug for the charger and it doesn't have headphones or a headphone jack very annoyed with this product",
            "The phone is amazing to use can't find anything negative to say about it.. camera is amazing. Speakers are perfect in the sound and quality. The speed of the phone is perfect. All round amazing product from the quality to the use/holding it. Light weight. Best phone 2021",
            "Lovely looking device and started off loving the s21 ultra but I'm having issues now with battery drain,heating up and the lag on photo quality is so bad the s5 I had years ago took a better picture,I've seen other people having similar issues and like them I've done everything to try and sort it as in master reset and other things,it's a fantastic phone but mines isn't so I'm happy for the people who has the s21 ultra which is 100% working mines is sadly not 100%",
            "Been using Samsung phones for years, and loving the S21 Ultra!! \nWas in the garden last night, saw the moon, and got a superlative photo of it!!",
            "It's been a while  since I owned a Samsung phone. The last flagship I got from Samsung was the Galaxy S5 though I'm a huge fan of the note series. I almost got the Galaxy Note 20 before I realised this phone existed.\n\nI have the European Exynos 2100 version which is a slight let down. Snapdragon 888 has better thermals and performance but even at that you can't turn your nose up at this phone.\n\nThe cameras on both front and back are incredible. They show a new level of detail and are comparable to even some DSLR cameras in image quality.\n\nFrom day one I put this device in an Otterbox case and its heavy. I don't mind the weight so much but its something to be mindful of.\n\nAndroid 11 with one U.I 3.1 is a pleasure to use. One thing I don't like is that I can't use the keyboard to post  emoticons on the end of sentences in Twitter posts.\n\nMy last phone used stock Android and I got used to that feature.\n\nThe phones responsiveness, download and install times are excellent. I've not used the 5G yet because my carrier doesn't currently cover my area but its good to know it's there for future, or should I find myself in the city Anytime soon.\n\nCustomisation is a major plus with the galaxy store offering tons of free personalisation content from complete themes to wallpapers and icons.\n\nAll in all, I got this phone simply because I didn't like the competition. This didn't stand out all that much to me but after some reviews I decided to go for it. I'm more than happy this was my choice. \n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G is an absolutely stellar phone. With additions like Samsung Dex, this can literally become a desktop in your pocket (especially with the 12GB of RAM) Check out 'next dock' and you'll see what I mean. Especially usefull if you write/code or want to remote into that beefy PC back home.\n\nDon't consider this. If you need a phone and have the extra dosh laying around just buy it. It's excellent.",
            "Absolutely love this device. Decided on a s21 as opposed to a new Xperia, first time in 10 years, love the features, the fonts, camera is SUPERB. Only issue I have is the sometimes unreliable wireless charging, and the lack of a 3.5mm jack.",
            "Beast phone love it only thing I would recommend is turning off 5g option cause I live in the UK!?",
            "Personally, I prefer the S10+.\n\nS21 Ultra is heavy, wide and software is full of bugs and typo's. It mixes British English with American English on some menus. \n\n5G is not a selling point, as this area only has a one-bar 4G signal.\n\nMy S10+ had 1TB internal memory whereas the S21 Ultra internal memory size is back to 512 Gb.\n\nIt must has its good points too and when I find some, you'll be the first to know.\n\nI purchased a case with an included S-Pen. The pen is great for games but the software for it is disappointing.\n\nIn short: too large and heavy to hold comfortably and firmware needs sorting.",
            "Samsung are definitely leading the way with this phone, I absolutely love it. The cameras are amazing including the technology that goes with it.\nOperation is much smoother over all to previous versions, the battery life is much better.\nIn fact pretty much everything is better.\nThe only things I miss are the removal of the aux port and expandable memory.\n\nSo pleased with my purchase",
            "Very happy with my new galaxy s21 ultra. \nExcellent battery life very nice screen and very good quality photos.",
            "Beautiful customised. Designed is fantastic price is high but its worth to buy",
            "Expected a charge for the money to be fair haha o well or atleast a wireless charger not everyone has a USB c port :))",
            "I do think the phone is great, But its let down by performance and not having a snapdragon in it. Would of been 5 star had UK version used Snapdragon. I'm a little fed up with not getting a Snapdragon in Samsung phones in the uk. I'm tempted to change next time for a snapdragon phone. Also when using camera still gets a little hot even after update (but not as bad since update)",
            "Nice lookin phone amazin camera nice size as well its for my son shame theres no ear phones included an charger plug especially as its pricey but he loves it .",
            "Great quality photos, great look. Overall great phone. I would definitely recommend it!",
            "Brillant phone fantastic camera would recommend this model",
            "The build quality is outstanding and the new fingerprint proof finish on the back is so cool. I just love everything about this phone. The camera is amazing and packed with useful features, plus the A.I. zone is fun too. In general the whole phone is full of great features and compared to my old Galaxy S7 the software and U.I is so much nicer everything is much better integrated and it all runs super fast and smooth. There's a ton of little improvements compared to my old phone which all add up to making a huge difference. The little things count too! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is thinking of buying this phone!",
            "My daughter like this phone",
            "Appears to work well but not sure if there's an difference with my previous S10+. I'm still discovering its potential. I was not happy for excluding the memory slot because it limits options. Not everyone likes cloud memory for fear of losing it or possibility of it being stolen. Overall it does the job as expected.",
            "I love this phone, the adaptive refresh rate is such a step up and the size of the screen is perfect. Coming from a note 9 everything feels like a step up in class. The best thing has the be the camera though, there are so many different ways to shoot photos. And 4k 60 video from both front and back. Also directors view for vlogs. Also 100x zoom gets you shots like this.......",
            "Love the Ultra 21 - super fast processing of various tasks and dazzling display. Cameras are fantastic, such a huge range of possibilities regarding depth of field and zooming in . Best Samsung camera ever.",
            "I swapped my S10 to S21 Ultra and obviously there's a lot of improvements. Main reason I bought Ultra was because of cameras - I am thinking to get rid of my bulky DSLR. Also battery life - with playing games and my constant usage, after a full day I still got 30% left.",
            "Great battery, would help if a charger was not so expensive and hard to find!\n\nTakes amazing pictures!",
            "Great device, incredibly efficient & has a great battery.",
            "The phone itself is fantastic, the cameras work amazingly. My only problem was not having an adapter for the headphones",
            "Cracking phone everything  gyou need in a device bes thing about it has to be the camera",
            "Upgraded from s10 which was a solid phone no issues at all to s21 Ultra wow is all I can say 120hz QHD amazing, camera's again amazing overall amazing device well done Samsung, and to add amazing trade in from Samsung 5 stars from me",
            "So from 2011 I've had every S device from S2 to not s21 ultra.  Immediately I noticed the size and weight increase from my previous devices.  But you do get used to it. It's a compromise for the larger screen and battery. \nThe camera is awesome. The zoom just incredible. Detail my eyes couldn't see. \nThe screen, power and battery all upgrades for me. \n\nThe downside is the weight and size. I'm a guy with big hands but this has become a two hand phone for some tasks.  Slightly irritating but not a deal breaker. \n\nThe lack of an SD slot and charger will be a deal breaker for some. I do some video editing on the fly with my device and my old device had 1.5TB with SD card.  My S21U has only 512Gb then I reply on the cloud. It's just tricky.\n\nOverall it's probably the best device on the market, but c'mon Samsung bump that international storage up! Pen drives and cloud is a pain in the bum!",
            "The touchscreen for fingerprint recognition is very temperamental \nOften does not work and have to use my pass code\nI prefer Google pay to Samsung pay too",
            "Good zoom experience fast device and features with Dex and spen support",
            "Very very impressed with the s21 ultra 5g. Great battery, very very fast. Camera outclasses every other phone on the market.",
            "The Galaxy S21 Ultra ticks nearly all the boxes when defining what a premium smartphone should be. I say nearly, because my only complaints are that it's missing expandable memory and lacks the superfast wired charging enjoyed by other flagships. Disappointed that Samsung have jumped on the bandwagon regarding the exclusion of a power adapter or other bundled accessories. For the premium price one expects something more in the box.\nBut all that aside, you can't argue that this is easily the best smartphone of 2021. From the stunningly bright high resolution and 120Hz refresh screen to super impressive camera modules including an incredible 10x optical zoom, along with S-Pen support, high capacity battery, cutting edge performance all wrapped up in a beautifully designed and first class build quality package, this certainly raises the bar for premium smartphones.",
            "The last Samsung I had before, was the S8. I then had various brands since before making the decision to get the S21 Ultra. And oh my.... it doesn't disappoint. Starting off with the drawback, cost... there's no denying it. Its very expensive and in my eyes, a little too much money, hence why I went to a few brands in the last few years. I did however, miss some of the premium features, and having to swallow the cost, I thought \"I hope this is worth it\". Well, I can honestly say, it's well and truly worth it. It's a very capable phone with THE BEST camera. The display is phenomenal and the software works flawlessly. My only complaint, is why did it not come with the Snapdragon for UK markets?!? The exynos is good, but the Snapdragon would've made the deal sweeter. Overall, I'm very happy with the phone, and I hope longevity wise, it lasts. If you have the finances to support it, and you're looking for an extremely good phone, with the camera and ancillaries to match, it's a must have. My final line, I'm very happy with it, and will continue to enjoy the phone.",
            "This phone has great features and fantastic cameras! I love that the camera also suggests to use a different functions depending on what you are trying to capture!!",
            "It's the more amazing phone I've every had so easy to use and the camera and power second to none",
            "I'm note fan, but the s21 ultra is the best phone till the note 21 comes hopefully. Great screen , good speakers, easy to use, now it can be customised with good lock , overall best of the year for me , till the note comes.",
            "Love this phone the camera is unbelievable never regret the purchase",
            "Upgraded my galaxy plus 10 for this pointless s21. No headphone jack and still waiting for live buds...its been 4 weeks and counting! Oh and you cannot insert additional storage card. You would have to choose the phone with larger capacity meaning it cost more, I should've read the reviews before I jumped on to the ice! Face palm emoji",
            "Really coming to grips with the new Samsung S21 and still cannot believe the price. Everything about this phone feels modern and stylish, as well as raising the bar compared to it's market rival's.",
            "I absolutely love my new ultra, from the sleek look to the cameras it is truly a flagship to die for",
            "its nice abit thinker than the note 10plus 5g but not as wide. better battery life and better performance i have yet to use the phone to its max but looking forward to trying it comparing it to my note 10+ well there is not much major diffrence",
            "Great camera n battery life. \nExpensive on contract or to buy only downside I can see thus far after 1 month use of phone.",
            "The camera on the s21 is awesome I love it pluss has so much memory and there is loads of other cool apps to play with",
            "A great device who are looking for a big phone that has the best display. Been using it for 1 month I am really loving it.",
            "I love my new Galaxy S21 Ultra phone, the features are amazing and the new one UI 3.0 is brilliant, the only issues I can find is the cellular and WiFi connectivity, stability and strength need to be vastly improved as I get a lot of dropped calls and WiFi occasionally drops out while in use, other than that I love this phone and highly recommend it to anyone",
            "Best phone I have ever had it's so fast and the colour is so clear, really easy to use. Love love love",
            "S21 ultra with the smart view case is brilliant.\nLove the camera and features.the only downful is the screen as it scratches really easily.",
            "So happy with this phone. Upgraded from the s10 which was also a fantastic phone. However the s21 feels smoother to operate and is faster. camera is brilliant",
            "I switch form s10plus and now I see that overall features are incredible amazing from screen to cameras and more :)",
            "So far really enjoying my s21 ultra. I work as a digiral artist and it is great for reviewing work and co ordinating digital media.",

            "Amazing!! Love Samsung.  the Best \nlove the phone \nLove the camera \nBiggest phone I've ever had but so easy to use, smooth. I waited 6yrs to upgrade and I'm Very happy with my choice",
            "Great Camera fluid dynamic screen love the build quality",
            "I got the Samsung galaxy s21 5g bout 3 weeks ago nd have nothing but problems with it.  Shocking battery life, constantly freezing, the camera freezes, you have to restart the phone to turn the volume up.   I used a huaweip20 mate pro  before this for 2/3 years and that phone is still far better than this piece of junk I'm using now.  \n\nIf you're thinking of buying on, DONT.",
            "Awesome phone with great battery life so many useful features,  love this phone best Samsung to date",

            "I have been using one ui for a number of years now, and just enjoy its sleek design and ease of use. I am happy with the handset but disappointed with the removal of the plugin earphones and charger.",
            "I love the new s21 ultra.. it has smoothed out the camera issues it had with the 20 ultra. Easy to use many options to change photos. The phone in general is fantastic. The only niggle I have is the on and off button. Wish it was still on the side.",
            "Find the screen a bit big for my thumb to reach the apps, don't find it much quicker than the s10 tbf, the camera is amazing tho",
            "The cameras  on this 21 ultra is amazing, the best I have ever seen",
            "Best phone I have had absolutely love it great display and usual Samsung high quality",
            "Well I like to think I'm a gadget geek. I've been waiting for the S21 ultra for a while and can say I have not been disappointed. Love the speed and the look of the screen. So dynamic. Photos are great but suffer in low light. Other than that it is a phone or the phone to have!!",
            "This phone is fantastic, love all the features no dissatisfaction so far.i have never been so happy.",
            "Love my new phone, so glad I went back to  Samsung, I love taking photos and can now take better photos than before.",
            "Nice pictures, very fast processor and the perfect camera system.",
            "I upgraded to the new S21 from my previous long-lived S8 which I loved. Its a much heavier phone but obviously extra components, a slightly bigger screen and far, far superior battery made me expect that. Functionality is very similar but frequent misplaced letters when typing which has never been an issue before. Also had a few occasions where an incoming call cannot be answered as the swipe on the screen would not work. \nI understand the move to wireless connections but still feel a jack for headphones would have been nice, even if only for occasional use. I feel when you are charging what Samsung are for their galaxy buds it effectively increases the cost of the phone (my buds were free in an offer but my partners were not). \nLooks and feel is great, as ever. Slight bugs at the start which I hope will be resolved in updates soon. Fantastic camera, needs work on signal retention but some of that may be my carrier. Plenty of capabilities for what I want. I just feel I was expecting a bit more than I've got for the cost. Feels very much like a very small boost on my S8, rather than multiple generations later jump I thought I'd get. Still like it though. Great phone",
            "The weight of the phone takes time to adjust too. Taking screen shots and turning the phone on and off is also tricky compared  to the Samsung S10+ as the buttons are only on the right hand side on the ultra where as the 10+ has buttons on either side to take screen shots. Battery life seems good. Sometimes I have to tap the screen a few times to get it to work. Not yet used all the functions yet but so far the phone seems ok.",
            "Samsung galaxy s21 5g\nThis phone is great, simple to use. The camera is amazing. can't rate this phone enough",
            "Fantastic new phone (S21 Ultra).\nGreat battery, tons of features, fully customisable, \nSuperb new camera, although I have found that it struggles slightly with low light shots a little bit.",
            "In 2015 I decided to switch from iPhone to Android and while Iphone was good it was to  basic.\n\nI love that the battery life last literally 2 days for me. \n\nThe screen size is great for me as I have quote sensitive eyes so when watching videos on 21 ultra my eyes don't get as sore !\n\nThe camera functions are so fun to play with the quality and moment by moment capture is so on point cut and clear! \n\nI downloaded a lot of stuff for a lot of different hobbies such as game designing, movies and emulation apps and uts just so simple and organized laid out in your files \n\nI can honestly say that there just isn't a better phone",
            "The reception is just really poor. \nIt makes using mobile data pretty much pointless.\nHoping there is an update to this quick smart or it is getting sent back.",
            "The device itself is very well built. It's speedy, it has a nice, premium feeling. The non-shiny finish of the back doesn't accumulate fingerprints and skin oil. Haven't played too much with the camera, but it does what it says. The display is an assassin. It's big, bright, smooth and colours just pop. For users who prefer a more true-to-life view, there is a setting to make colours less vivid and processed. The sound quality of the speakers is not great however, it just feels too thin compared to iPhone which I had previously. There are extra settings and adjustments available, but none of them outputs better bass, which is a bummer.\n\nThe software experience has definitely evolved, but is still awful. First, no music app can display a progress bar on lock screen... this is probably the worst drawback. The Samsung Pass app is great, but I have no more than 4 apps supporting it. Samsung should be doing more for the auto-fill adaptation. When switching between 2 apps, for example Chrome and Settings, every time you tap the settings icon, it won't take you where you've been, but it will take you to the settings main menu. The edge-swipe gesture to go back doesn't work at all sometimes. Overall, OneUI needs a lot of polishing.",
            "Had this handset a while now. \n\nOverall I would say the S21 ultra 5g is one of the better handsets. However I would recommend comparing to the S20 ultra before spending so much just because flagship.\n\nIt's a nice handset for sure. I'm just not convinced it's much more capable than the previous generation.",
            "Loving the phone so far, upgraded from s10 plus and the 1st thing I noticed was the smoothness of the new 120hz display. 10 days later, this is still the biggest differtiator for me. Being one of those users who prefer qhd+ over fhd+ on my old s10+, it was important to me that my new phone was not a step down and hence the s21ultra was my only option. Pleased to say the display has more than delivered for me.\nOn the camera front,  while I'm happy with them in veneral, the biggest upgrade for me has been the incredible macro capabilities on the main lens (rather than the advertising hyped zoon lens - which is decent by its own right but the macro adds a new dimension to by pics and I'm more pleased for that).\nThe haptic rumble seems much improved which I'm pleased about as well. \nThe only negative so far for me is the weight (I would've preferred it to be a tad lighter coming from s10+ . but oh well..). Overall pretty pleased so far..",
            "Great phone, as expected. Although not radically different from S10",
            "Absolutely brilliant glad I went back to a Samsung not changing to any other phone from now on. Feature are quick and fast.",
            "Nearly sent phone back due to it overheating but that was only for the first couple of hours new phone and transferring everything over. The phone is really easy to use only negative I have is the battery life its not as good as my old phone.",
            "I think it's fair to say that as a result of S21 Ultra by Samsung, they have literally thrown down the gauntlet and dared everyone to compete. The camera features are spectacular, processor and memory speeds are amazing, there is is literally nothing bad to say. Well done Samsung, take a bow, you deserve it!",
            "I love my new device.the camera is perfect everything on the device is perfect love it",
            "Really snappy device, love the s-pen it really makes photo editing easy and simple.\nLack of headphone jack and sd card mean a 4* review - if these features were included it would be 5 all the way.",
            "I need say nothing go buy the ultra you WILL NOT REGRET IT !!!!",
            "My first time using a Samsung phone and I love it. Very beautiful, lots of customisation, good battery life, lots of cool features and very snappy.",
            "What can i say but wow , I've had the S21 Ultra since the day of launch and I'm not disappointed not by the stretches of the imagination...\n\nThe camera quality is amazing, night mode, and the option to take stills from videos and edit remove and contrast them without going to preset \"filters\" \nLarge screen easy on the eyes even with the brightness down \nThe sound quality is the best crisp and loud, they really have surpassed the predecessor devices \nThat I've ever owned.\n\nThe processor copes with all my app online games with a great clear picture \n\nDon't bother with iPhone cause they will catch up and copy like they always do, \nAndroid all the way , can't wait to the next installment of the Samsung Hall of success",
            "Love my new device . The camera is definitely amazing . My phone is working very well and fast and I'm happy to use it. Samsung is my favourite brand almost 10 years and never felt my anticipation",

            "I have owned many many phones...Apple (iPhone 12)/Huawei/LG/Galaxy's (older) and the S21 Ultra is by far the best!I would never switch to nothing else this phone/Companion has won me over!!\nLove the bright and bold screen/Love the camera tech/Love the flawless curves and it's bulletproof build quality/Love the operating system with its pick and mix of unlimited changes to make it to our own. \n\nOverall amazing phone which cant be beaten just yet!",
            "I always started with the cheaper Samsung range however last year I got the Samsung S20 Ultra and I was really impressed. That was until I got the Samsung S21 Ultra and I can honestly say it's the best phone I've ever had. The display is amazing, the features are top quality and it's so smooth to use. I can just glide across the screen with ease. Highly recommended purchasing this phone!",
            "Great battery life, great features im still finding out about it.\nLove the fact that wifi comes on automatically when i am home no need to switch it on or off.\nLike the fact u can programme it into silent mode between my sleeping time and alarm.\nAnd as for the cameras the are great toys to play with when you are filming and can choose between the cameras.\nIf i find a negative it is that for me the sound and vibration is still far less than an iphone something that i look for in my phone but i cant give up on samsungs since the S6",
            "An amazing phone. Pictures absolutely fantastic,  so easy to use",
            "This phone really does blow every competitor away by some length.\nI'm a photographer and the quality and features of the camera are outstanding - well ahead of the obvious competitor!\nThe battery is also phenomenal. I'm regularly getting between 36 480 hours on a single charge even when photo editing.\nWhy am I not rating it 5 star?\nSimply because Samsung have produced a high quality (and cost) phone then removed elements like charger, headphone jack and heart rate monitor.\nSamsung, you're better than THAT other lot, just let the phone quality speak for itself",

Give us a choice or equal footing.",
            "My 512Gb Exynos S21 Ultra is improving all the time in terms of overall video quality and low light quality in particular which for me is why I bought the phone. The photo camera is brilliant however and it is converting me into a picture person I must say. It's picture quality and zoom capacity are a revelation to me. Please just sort the low light and general light noise and texture problems out through updates and this phone will be perfection. The video quality is getting better though and I must thank you for the camera based software updates tick have been released. Brilliant battery and speed and smoothness and best ever display and magnificent design and lightning in app performance and revolutionary close to perfection camera is my summary.",

            "This phone is a great upgrade from my s10 with great battery life with heavy usage, an amazon detailed camera and over the past month the s21 ultra 5g has been running amazingly fast with no issues with hardware/software.\n\nMy only bad review is using the camera all the time for video/higher quality photos or if you have lots of larger files/music, it use a lot of memory which in the past would have been resolved using my tb sd card so please samsung for any future models either look into 1/2TB internal storage or bring back expandable sd card storage so the phone can be used to its highest capacity.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend the samsung s21 ultra 5g to anyone looking to upgrade to the latest model.",

            "Camara quality is the best the music is loud and I'm just in love with it",
            "Phone feels very similar to the S10 galaxy, no massive difference. Price is still high but, worse this time they don't provide you with any head phones, charging wire or adapter. There is no longer an AUX port and you are not provided with a conversion cable. I complained about the lack of compatibility with the wire given and the old adapters making charging difficult and the fact that i have newly installed USB port wall sockets which are no longer relevent to use. Disappointing.",

            "Bought a new S21 on the deal with free galaxy buds. \nPhone meets my expectations, a few little quirks that I had to get familiar with but overall a good experience. At the same time I bought the Samsung LED View Cover. It's a good cover for protecting the phone, great idea to put a card slot on the inside, it now leaves me somewhere safe to carry my card without carrying my wallet. However,  the LED function is just a gimmick and rediculously expensive for what you get. LED display only shows for a very short period of time and is pretty pointless. You can create a LED image for your contacts or create your own. The create your own facility is piintless, it's basic and just about impossible to write / draw anything clearly. Theres a nice LED clock which shows when you close the cover but this goes off aftet a few seconds. If you want to see the time you have to open the case to activate it so you may aswell look at the screen, I'd suggest you buy a far cheaper alternative.\nCamera is pretty good but theres not a simple Macro operation specific for close ups, you use an associated setting that dosent work well at all. Regarding tbe battery although a greater capacity than my S8, I haven't noticed much of a distance.\n\nOverall a great phone and camera, buds are great but stay away from the gimick cases!",

The reasons for upgrading and moving over to this brand and model is for Google store, and 5G.  \nThere's really nothing that impresses me about this model in particular. \nIf is not broken, don't fix it comes to mind. \nJust a massive waste of material & time resources.  \nDoesn't come with earphones or charger plug due to the environmental factors...but then Samsung offers you free promotional ones that they ship out and package separately!?  The irony is truly remarkable and quite frankly, vile.\n\nI'm still waiting for my earpods.  Five weeks... and counting. Nice one.\n\nSigned, \n\nA. Hypocrite",

            "I've been using the s21 ultra for about a month now and I have to say it is perfect for me. I usually watch a lot of videos and Netflix each day, and on my old phone it would just drain the battery in a couple hours, but this one works perfectly.",
            "I love everything about the phone except for the fact that it becomes too hot to hold if I do any heavy lifting on my mobile network. There's something up with the power control system for the radios, or the battery/cooling system. I hope it can be fixed with software, I really do. If this persists outside of lockdown, where I have to depend heavily on mobile network as I commute, then I might have to request a return or exchange or refund as appropriate. Fix up, Samsung. As it currently is, won't be recommending to any friends. \n- slightly disgruntled S10+, s20 Ultra and s21 ultra owner.",
            "Got the s21 ultra on the Samsung upgrade programme but I have to say it feels a bit cheap compared to the s20+ I sent back. It's thicker, no doubt due to bigger battery, feels plasticy and has a sharp edge between the screen and the case for no reason. The s20+ was a premium feeling phone, not without operating faults but still much nicer than this one. Hopefully next year's model will go back to quality rather than this poor effort. Oh and no sd card slot now, what am I meant to do with my old one?",
            "This is the best phone on the market in my opinion, it is versatile and an excellent all round phone. It has a \"user-ability\" (appreciate its not a word) like no other. By this I mean, when you use the phone, everything is where is should be, it has been well thought out, it has evolved and more than anything- it does everything and more that a smart phone should do.",
            "First of all, I had a Samsung Galaxy s10+ before getting the S21 Ultra 5G... \n\nI have to say, not much difference. The camera is good, but there's still better out there. And some of what the adverts say about the quality of photo that comes from a video, well that's an exaggeration. \n\nSome of the features are just irritating. I guess because it's not that much of a step up from what I had. I'm struggling to see the amazing features. \n\nAll in all, I'm glad I didn't pay for it.",
            "Moving from the Note 10 Plus to the S21 Ultra has been fairly seamless. It's a similar size but noticeably faster. The screen refresh is a nice touch and the whole thing runs buttery smooth. Camera is awesome although I haven't explored all its features yet.\n\nIt's exoe dive but the way I see it, it saves me from having to lug a camera separately for many scenarios, which is a big deal for me. \n\nThe device is slightly thicker and heavier than the Note 10 Plus which is a bit disappointing and I wasn't aware it would be when I pre-ordered. It's a big heavy behemoth, which is fine by me but will definitely not be for some. Wife (small hands) couldn't live with it.",
            "I have a lot of Samsung gadgets and with the s21 ultra im finding something new every time I play on it and I dont think it's going to stop giving me new things to find love this phone highly recommended and I have to all friends.",
            "I love how amazing the camera is, allows you to take amazing pictures and is great for tiktok videos. I would easily  say this is the best phone I've had.",
            "The 21 ultra is amazing, love the fact you can use a S-pen with it, and the battery lasts so much long which is great for me",
            "Phone overheats when using video calls and can't multi task. Already changed device once and still same problem.",
            "This is easily the best phone I have had. Having upgraded from the s10+ I wasn't sure whether the difference would be big, but I was wrong. The screen is buttery smooth, the battery lasts all day and the camera is insane. Thoroughly recommend",
            "I love my S21 5g, it's the best phone ever without taking up too much pocket size, small powerful and packed with features which last all day, well done Samung",
            "S21 is alright so far... the video quality is OK but I cannot find the slow mo camera mode and Is there any way of making gallery folders password secure so that you don't have to compress them??",
            "Love my new S21 Ultra 5G. Great features and easy to use. Makes me want to use it for for more. Still getting familiar with the features.",
            "Love the new and upgraded software and features also love the 120htz screen and camera is awesome jus need slow motion and super slow.mo to be fixed and some zoom video in 4k 60htz needs improving apart from that wicked phone",
            "The vibrant display..the crisp sounds off the speaker..very fast phone..easy to use definitely a 5 outta 5..missed so many other factors as to why its such a good phone",
            "The last phone that made me feel this happy about it was my Samsung Note 4.\nIt's the perfect phone to me. It just feels and behaves right and the battery life is ace. I've not found a negative with it yet and the only negative I see is for Samsung as they will have to create an amazing phone for me to give this up. Simply love it.",
            "One of the best Samsung phones I've had and is packed with all different features. Also works.witj an s pen from a Samsung note 20 ultra, which is brilliant.",
            "Fab camera, very fast working phone, great new features, absolutely in love with it.",
            "It's big for my hand but it's best android phone so far. Camera quality no one can compare...even selfie is at best.",
            "I LOVE big phones mainly for my reading on kindle and this phone does not disappoint !\nI can read until the early hours of the morning not knowing what time it is with the eye comfort sheild I used it on my other phones but this one is top knoch I can leave it on all the time and I never have a headache! The camera is absolutely fantastic! I'm not a professional photographer or nothing close but some of the shots I've taken look like it!",
            "Best Android phone you can buy..... By far.\n\nJust wish they'd get rid of bixby and replace with google assistant.",
            "The camera alone is simply brilliant and the phone itself just works seamlessly amazing bit of kit",
            "Can't believe the camera functionality.  Terrific zoom",
            "I adore everything about my new Samsung, I switched from a Huawei p30 pro which I loved. I was a bit dubious but must say I am so happy I switched. The camera is amazing and the software is next level.",
            "Phones are amazing ultra and + s21 are both great premium phones. The camera, performance build and features are excellent. If these phones had micro sd I would be ecstatic but either way this is the way forward!",
            "Samsung galaxy s21 5G is great phone the camera is brilliant and the screen resolution is better than my samsung series tv.",
            "Amazing phone.  Best Android phone ever made so far!  I've barely scratched the surface with what it can do so far.",
            "Completely in love with this phone . Wish the s pen came with it but apart from that there are no down sides . Battery life is fantastic ,quality is brilliant and the camera is outstanding",
            "I have had the S series since they started them and have never failed to surprise me with features and looks with every model. S21 ultra is the best phone on the market at the moment. The battery life, the camera  just everything about the phone is outstanding. When paired with the watch 3 and buds pro everything is complete! I wish we got the s pen for that price tag but hey hi may be for the next model. Thank you Samsung and keep up the good work.",
            "Honestly the best of s series I've own since s5. Love design because it is different! Camera outstanding despite I'm still learning it. I haven't got any issues with it, maybe small one now with bluetooth range, but fix is coming with next update according to samsung. But no issues with overheating or poor battery life or camera like some people have. Wish that s pen be included with the phone with that price tag.\nGenerally good job samsung! Thanks",
            "I really like the new design on the cameras and back panel. Even tho I really miss the curved screen from the S10 and I felt like I made a mistake choosing s21 instead of the s20.\nThis phone feels like a space filler between 2 awesome phones. But oh well it comes with free ear buds which I had to apply for, and still waiting for it to arrive..... why couldn't they just include it in the box.... oh yeah follow looser Apple with their chargerless slim box.... \nAll in all I can't wait my 2 years to finish so I can be able to upgrade my phone again to something better IF Samsung decides to make better phones in the future. And I'm not talking about the foldable rubbish",
            "The phone is great I love everything about it apart from the battery am not impressed with it",
            "After years of of disappointment and and feeling of of worthlessness for my loyalty because of of the UK being forced to accept unless it than topspec flagship device the snapdragon version of the flagship has always been heaps and downs above the European Edition personally I don't know and don't understand how they can call it the same name when it was clearly two different phones but this time round the difference is so small between them it's nothing to worry about making the S21 Ultra 5G a flagship top spec Beast of a phone it is the best device iPad from Samsung ever what time is so pleased about finally we are are showing a Little Love instead of paying extra for less cameras out of this out of this world can I am ugly it's not my strong point the only reason I'm not scoring maximum points for this review it's because I know the snapdragon version is better",
            "The last time I had a flagship level phone was a Samsung (S8+ Plus) and after smashing the screen on a buggie in Lanzarote I decided to get a midrang. Well i missed the cameras so much from my S8 so much that after a long time from a flagship I decided ti get the best one on the market (S21 Ultra) now after returning I can admit that cameras on phones have become even more powerful than I'd ever expected. This shot I took of the moon on my way to work in the morning was taken on 30x zoom and the phone is capable of 100x. Trust me 100x feels like you're on your way to the moon!",
            "I've just upgraded both my phone and my missus' to new S21 5G's and I honestly have to say that we're impressed!  We play games for hours, go out for walks and take photos and still have enough battery to last out the rest of the day with plenty of web browsing.  \n\nThe only thing I really miss is my heart rate sensor but I can't stand wearing a watch.  I might give one of the new Galaxy Watch Active a spin but I wouldn't want to splash out hundreds just to find it uncomfortable.\n\nThe camera is great and Single Take is fantastic.  Shoot a video for a few seconds and you get mini video clips, loops suitable for uploading on to social media and photos in a range of sizes and filters. \n\nOver all we're happy customers.",
            "Amazing phone  unbelievable camera  great battery  fast  love it",
            "I absolutely love it! It's fast and easy to use and the battery life is amazing. Only thing I would say is they need to make jeans with bigger pockets to fit it in !",
            "Love my new Samsung s21 ultra.... just don't understand having paid all that one you don't get a proper charger or even a fast charger like my A70? Madness!",
            "I love camera so much.  The best to take on nights pictures.",
            "The S21 Ultra is super easy to use with many fantastic features including compatabilitywith the Samsung S pen that can be used for navigating through the phone or to draw digital artwork, but my absolute favourite is the camera function. The picture quality is absolutely amazing for a phone camera and I definitely recommend this for anyone.",
            "I'm usually getting the smaller S series devices, last phone however was the S10+. it had amazing features, this S21 Ultra...miles ahead. The performance, screen refresh rate, camera, physical build...top class",
            "So many new features and the performance of the device is outstanding. \n\nNote taking (especially with the new SPen) and photo/camera quality. All the new built-in apps. There's so much to enjoy with this phone. I can't put it down. \n\nTry asking your phone to find you flights. Bit of a tease, as we cannot currently travel. But now I know where I can get flights to my dream holiday destination.",
            "I had the note 20 ultra and before that the note 10 plus. I just got s21ultra and all I can say is that I did the right thing. Phenomenal phone.",
            "A year on and the S21 Ultra is delivering what the S20 Ultra failed to do",
            "Really responsive and a good size screen. Difficult to use with one hand but possible, due to the large screen - more difficult with a protective case on it. \nOverall a fantastic phone with great connectivity and the camera is phenomenal, well reccomended if looking fir the latest tech",
            "It's fast light and battery lasts a long time even when gaming the batter last very long time on a charge, my other u played for a hour batter needed charging not the s21 keeps going and going on one charge.",
            "The camera is amazing, the features are so much better and the picture quality is great!",
            "Excellent phone Call quality is the best I've come across, Holds calls Well. Camera is the best I have seen on a smartphone the moon mode actually works its not fake, Build quality also Excellent Well done Samsung only gripe is lack of charger and headphones otherwise excellent",
            "Absolutely love this phone, looks fantastic, camera is awesome and feels well made.",
            "Best smart phone that I have had by far from apple to this just wow the phone is just works so much better then I can even say photos are just so crisp and not pixeled un like any apple phone",
            "I upgraded from my previous Samsung S7 to S21 Ultra. Wow. Awesome upgrade. This S21 Ultra really feels next-level. The design is extremely unique. The display is the most beauiful & vibrant display ever. The 120 Hz refresh rate is sooooo buterry smooth. The phantom back colour is a sensational masterpiece. The battery is excellent. Easily lasts me more than a day & half. The performance is excellent. Im not a gamer at all but the performance is fast & ultra-responsive. The camers are excellent. Like a kid in a candy shop - spolit for choices. Im not an expert in camera but its excellent piece of engineering. The Software is excellent. Have recieved regular updates. The Ultrasonic finger print sensor is excellent. Have not had any issues. I have waited patiently to upgrade & this is the PERFECT phone to upgrade to. I hope to purchase the S-Pen Pro in the future & really fully maximize the capabilities of this phone. This is truly the All Round Ultra Super Phone.",
            "Phone is exceptional, battery life, usability, features all impeccable. The subtle, little touches are fantastic too such as the edge of the screen notification lights are what set this phone apart for me!",
            "I have this phone for a week know and I love it. The battery life and the screen are perfect. I get a full day with just one charge. The screen is massive and bright. Very happy with it. The only negative is the fact that I had to buy and adaptor.",
            "Brilliant phone. Great Camera. A big improvement on the S20 despite not owning that phone. I had the S10+ before and have had every Samsung Galaxy phone since the S1. Can't wait to get the S Pen advanced version later this year.",
            "What's not to love about it. A 108mp camera a macro camera and telescope 8k video recorder all in the palm of your hands.\n\n2 days on average with out having to charge your phone. Pheromonal performance and a premium and gorgeous design.",
            "Everything you would expect from a class smary phone is here in this phonr",
            "This Samsung galaxy s21 ultra is the worst phone I've bought. The battery literally lasts 3 quarters of the day. Make sure you carry your charger, you will need it!!!",
            "The S21 Ultra is a great phone. Brilliant camera, battery life and performance.",
            "I've upgraded from the S8, so was a bit hesitant at losing the curved edge but honestly its not detracted at all. The screen quality is still fantastic, and watching films look incredibly bright and vivid. \nCamera is superb, and 4k video recording is great. The image stabilisation feature is a new addition but really brings your videos to life. Can see this being super helpful for those that do content creation. \n\nI'm so happy I took the plunge and bought it outright, was about time! If your thinking of buying, make use of the 14 day cooling off period and keep all boxes, packaging etc.",
            "Great phone but phone unlocks when I swipe to the right and don't know how to stop it",
            "I upgraded from S10+ and didn't consider the battery. Having used it for a few weeks, I found it simply wasn't good enough for my demands.  \nI love all other aspects of the phone so I have now replaced it with S21+.",
            "The s21 ultra is a fantastic phone all round camera is great 10/10 for me",
            "Amazing phone. Definitely next gen leaders. Amazing quality and features. Love the camera definitely a must from me and it sets the standard no doubt. Amazing phone all round, sleek, robust, all round purpose phone.",
            "Ok,  over priced as usual for phones these days\nLike every phone now, glorified camera",
            "This Samsung Galaxy S21 doesn't seem any faster than my S10",
            "Phone is great. Battery life is amazing. Performance outstanding. Cannot fault it one bit.",
            "I used to be an apple freak. But I felt like a change so I came to samsung and had the galaxy s9 and it turned me. But now I have the s21 ultra and ohh wow its amazing and thw camera is incredible.. love it!",
            "I have had Samsung phones for quite a few years now but the S21 Ultra knocks the socks off of any phone I've ever had before. The camera is absolutely amazing. The zoom is phenomenal. Easy to use.  I just love it. Haven't found a thing wrong with it.",
            "Okay, so off the bat:\nYes, it doesn't have a micro SD (just get the 256 or 512gb model and use this magical thing called cloud storage - also I have a Samsung T5 so I gave an external option), there is no charger in the box (a really dumb complaint imo, considering you may as well just buy a super fast pd charger and you'll be sorted for all your phones), and of course the headphone jack doesn't exist. Honestly, these are things people have been complaining about for years and it's time to move on.\n\nThe S21 Ultra has the memory and RAM capacity of a laptop/custom PC build. The speed, the beautiful 120hz QHD display is the best and certainly one of the fastest. The camera has everything you'd want and I've not even got to trying out 3/4 of the creative features available.\n\nIt would be nice to have the S Pen included and with somewhere on the phone to store it, but I'm not a big pen user and I'm happy to wait for the S Pen Pro. \n\nAlso, Samsung is a loyal brand. Updates are always welcome, the customer service is great.",
            "Beautiful design great cameras screen and sound - oh - and you can make phone calls!!",
            "S21 ultra is an excellent choice and combine note and S in one with the case with S pen. Works perfectly",
            "After just a few weeks with my new S21 ultra, I'm blown away by how fast and seemless everything is, and the cameras and outstanding. I chose the 512gb/16gb version to future proof my needs, as I intend to fully utilize the cameras once we are out of lockdown. This really is the best phone available right now.",
            "Overall I find the S21 to be a great phone, it just lacks some features I've been used to.  For example there's no expandable memory slot, headphone socket or notification indicator light.  However I guess this is the way phones will be going in the future and it's just a matter of getting used to new ways of working.  I understand some of those features may be available on the Ultra version, but that's way beyond my price range.  I'm very happy with my phone though and would have no hesitation in recommending it.  Samsung quality is always excellent in my experience and the S21 is no different.",
            "One UI is nice to use and great to see some Google integration into the phone as well. Scoped storage is about annoying but that's Google's bad design. The real issue is the camera quality. After comparing some shots with my old pixel 4 I'm not seeing much improvement which was the main reason I got the Ultra. A lot of noise and ghost edging in basic daylight photos, and when zoomed looks digital effect not optical. Also comparing photos with a Snapdragon version of the phone (mine is an Exonsys), the SD photos seemed to be sharper and clearer?",
            "The speed of the s21 ultra  is outstanding and the camera is superb the display is pin sharp stunning phone",
            "Everything. Speed. Picture quality. Battery life. Pen use. The weighty feel spells quality build. I'm still learning new and more tricks.",
            "Title says it all, was looking forward to this phone since it was rumoured and I have to say it is a disappointment in terms of battery life and performance.\n\nExample: I will have four apps open (Chrome, Pokemon Go, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger) and the phone will just grind to a halt or at best intermittently work. Battery life... Well out of the box I was getting maybe a day from the phone... Now.. 10-12 hours. Its brand new and I still have this issue.",
            "The best phone without a doubt, they greatly overrated it, but with good reason.",
            "The phone is elegant and so easy to get around all its features.",
            "Enhanced processing  for games camera but when zoomed out to 100 gets blurry",
            "It's fast , but too many times I. Having to restart the phone as some apps won't respond sometimes,  its starting to really get me annoyed .",
            "Samsung s21 ultra is the best of the best topping the phone on the market at the moment if my active runs low on battery or my galaxy buds pros need a bit of juice i can just pop them on the back and bingo battery life is fantastic pictures and videos are unbelievable and the design is great unfortunately due to the case i have its Scratched my screen but as i say thats my own fault sound is great and watching YouTube and others great picture on screen and audio is great. The price when you think about it you get more for your money with buds pro and smart tag free if you pro ordered and buds live if you bought it after release date over all i got to say for me its the best phone on the market and cant wait to see what samsung do next",
            "I was concerned I shouldn't purchase the s21 as an upgrade to the S20, but it's so much better an experience than the S20 was from the S10. The camera is a dream to use now,  love the distance stabilisation.",
            "Absolutely love my S21 ultra, great for gaming and amazing camera",
            "Switched from iPhone to the s21 ultra \nOnly negative is the keyboard for me as apple have the keyboard mastered and apple pay Is far superior and easier to use than Samsung pay",
            "I got the S21 as an early upgrade offer. I have to say that although it's a decent phone I'm not that impressed. \nStraight out of the box and you're doing stuff to make it run better. And not much of that works. In all honesty I'd easily have my Note 10 back. \nI've tried gaming on this phone but there is so much lag. \nAnd no matter what you do, the battery life isn't that great. To get anything close to a full day you need to compromise on so much. \nNot my favourite phone by Samsung.",
            "I have had my s21 ultra for one month now and the quality of the phone is far better than my last phone the only down side it there is no slot to put a memory card in witch is a big down side to the phone as I tend to put lots of music and videos on my phone with the s21 ultra I have to keep an eye on how much room in the memory I have left .",
            "Screen, battery and speed are all an upgrade from Note 9. Getting used to hole punch camera, does spoil the impact of the display a bit. 120hz a surprisingly big difference to how things look. Software is amazing so to hear that 4yrs of updates from Samsung is a big deal. This is going to be hard to top",
            "Brilliant device can't fault it excellent battery life screen and camera. I have always had the s series from Samsung and this is the best so far.",
            "I recently brought the new galaxy S21 and have had it for a couple of weeks now thinking the issues I've been having will improve in updates but they seem to not work. The issues I am having are that the phone will randomly restart multiple times randomly throughout the day, I have not had a day where it would not restart at somepoint. I have tried downloading the latest update but it gets to 25/26% before it errors and restarts without installing.",
            "Samsung S21 battery life is a joke, even with Power Saving mode activated and Enhanced Processing deactivated.",
            "I love my new phone but for the 21 ultra I kind of expected more, I wish they has a system updat like apple did where I can design my homescreen",
            "Great phone again from Samsung camera performance is superb",
            "Camera quality is absolutely fantastic, you will never need to buy a standalone camera when you have the S21. Screen display is so vivid and bright with colour filling all edges. Smooth and fast display to ensure surfing the Internet or playing your favourite mobile game is one to remember. Very impressed, don't miss out and get yours today!!!!",
            "The Samsung s21 ultra,  has everything a phone should have.  The screen is of high quality,  the resolution is very good.  The size of the is just right for the current climate.  The memory options are OK for me.  It could have been the perfect phone if the price would have little more lower , as the competition are managing to keep prices low and the removal of the charging brick is not good as I've spoken to of people who said they are disappointed.  The camera I feel is the best on the market , and I'm really look forward how this camera will get even better.  Also Samsung the performance of the UK model needs to improvement, as it lags and gets slower, this after speaking to people but the US model has better performance.  But S21 ultra us the best phone overall so far this year, looking forward to the note 21.",
            "I have had several Galaxy S phones, an S5, an s7, an S8 and now the 21. Throughout these iterations the model has had features stripped away. First the S6 lost the IR blaster and swappable battery, the S21 has done away with the infinity screen, glass body, mini jack, heart rate sensor, and even a mains charger in a desperate attempt to compete with the new wave of budget flagships from China.\n\nThis is a shame. I miss flagships that were tech powerhouses and let you do things that were borderline Star Trek technology.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it isn't a bad phone, just another average flagship in a sea of mediocrity. On the plus side the camera is very good. Were it not for that, this would likely be the last Samsung Galaxy S that I would buy for myself.",
            "Love the design prefer the plastic metal nice phone",
            "I've been a Sony guy for most my life, but this year I decided to pre-order the s21 ultra because of many different reasons, the fact that Samsung innovative everytime they bring out a new device, the way the biometrics work, finger print scanner under the screen is fantastic how crystal clear the camera is by far the best camera I've used on mobile device.  Overall super impressed with this device.",
            "The S21 Ultra is a great phone! I take a lot of photos of my seedlings/plants and it captures them perfectly - the auto focus is the best yet! Love lots of the new features although I still haven't found my way around them all yet lol. Certainly the best phone I have owned. I haven't come across any issues to date! No overheating etc.",
            "Loving the S21 Ultra.\nPros:\nBig Battery  means an all day phone or 2days for light users.\nCameras -  Ultra wide , macro, Super zoom all in one.\nAnd Spen is a bonus you can't  miss.\n\n\n\nThings that could be improved.\nMaking phone run cooler with software enhancements. \nCamera hardware is First Class but needs finessing in the software  department to get it to Awesome.",
            "Have not had a samsung for long time and went back to the s21 ultra what a nice phone now got all the  Features I want overall happy with my  Purchase",
            "Enjoying the phone immensely, will enjoy it a lot more when I receive my ear buds",
            "It is a great phone. I thought it was overhyped but now I know better. No greater phone has ever been made",
            "Specwise, the Galaxy S21 is a great phone. Runs games well, has a good camera, is easy to operate and the rumble feature feels nice.\n\nHowever, the screen, while displaying nice and clear visuals, damages extremely easily. Despite using several cases including two official Samsung ones and never using the phone for anything other than light use, both my original phone and the replacement I was sent via Amazon developed scratches and dents that discolour the screen. Despite being placed on tables face up and in my pocket with front covers on, the screen was still damaged even through the pre-installed screen protector.\n\nVery disappointing for Samsung's expensive flagship phone, especially when it works so well in other areas. Great phone to use, but being so fragile despite it using the 'toughest Gorilla Glass yet' makes it hard to fully recommend.",
            "After having many different phones in the s series, the improvement between different generations seems to have stopped at the s10. Everything the s21 ultra does, my older s10 does. The camera on the s21 ultra is a massive disappointment. It's being sold as the ultimate camera phone, but the quality is worst than my s10. Maybe future software updates will make the s21 live up to all the hype. If you listen to music through Bluetooth, either through headphones or something like your car stereo, the maximum volume has been reduced so much that seems 50% lower than the s10. I listen to master quality tracks through my tidal app and the sound quality is very disappointing. Please sort this samsung. Overall don't expect that wow factor you used to get every couple of years when upgrading your mobile. Don't bother with the ultra, I wish I hadn't.",
            "This is the best phone ever made! The camera is absolutely amazing",
            "S21 ultra is a brilliant phone - great camera, beautiful display, and a good battery\n\nOnly issue I've had is that it keeps disconnecting my snapchat from the Internet, not sure whether that's a setting I've missed, the phone itself or an issue on snapchats end",
            "I bought this phone because i had high hopes for the camera. The selfie camera first made very white washed pictures but the clarity was good. Now i was sent a software to update and the whitewash has been made better but the clarity of the selfie has become worse. Could this be sorted?",
            "S21 ultra 5G has met my expectations from the S20 ultra.   Extremely pleased with this phone.   Moon shots are great also.",
            "Great phone. Super powerful with a great camera and many new features. The screen is very nice as well. Only small issue is the phone is quite big so doesn't easily fit into pockets. S21 ultra has been made to work with the s-pen but quite disappointing that the pen doesn't come with the phone and can't be stored in the body of the phone like it can be with the older model note 20...its like it's an afterthought to add that functionality. Still overall very happy with the phone but a little expensive.",
            "I've had my new S21 ultra for a couple of weeks now and I am absolutely in love with this device. As a father I'm always having a go at my children about their screen time but this phone in Matt Black, is the daddy! I have to say it's the vest phone I've ever had. I have to use an iPhone for work due to security but it's making me hate it more compared to this baby right here.",
            "By far the best phone I've ever had! Sleek, fast and does what u need plus sooo much more.",
            "The new S21 ultra is an improvement on the S20. Camera seems much better. No problem overall",
            "Hi. I am really impressed with the S21 ultra. The only thing I would say is that the battery life isn't very good. I struggle to get a day's use.",
            "It's a nice phone I don't even mind the plastic back and the new exonox chip is much better than the one that was in my s10 this new chip doesn't heat up the phone like the s10 .",
            "The pictures what him make is stunning and clear is 21 ultra yes",
            "You can't blow your trumpet too much or people just think you are a showoff.\nIt is a really, really amazing phone.",
            "Pre ordered  at launch  based on the  reviews  and the tech that was advertised.\nThe phone its beautiful,solid and chunky, its not cheap but worth the money \nThe screen its the best,battery life I think could be better, still get me through 1 day but for 5000mha not what u may expect\nCamera and features outstanding,the exyonos 2100 seems good,\n2 negatives:no charger come with it so beware, and no expansion for memmory card,so get the right one for your needs",
            "All the features of the SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 ultra have surpassed my expectations. The Phantom Silver is a terminator of all other phones on the market, feels the correct weight to represent its specs.",
            "I love the 21 ultra it's like mini laptop with phone its also stylish elegant features I use daily and most thing also I love about it is the battery long lasting. This phone is worth of spending every dime on it! But as the beautiful phone cost much in my opinion they should have put charger in to the box also",
            "The S21 ultra phone, ticks so many boxes, it's your quick and easy to use computer, camera, music and if you have the S pen it opens up so many more things to do. In my opinion the phone is currently the best by a mile.",
            "S21 ultra is great but just not happy that this device cannot be used with Samsung vr.\nI really was looking forward to use it with my Samsung gear vr.",
            "The s21 ultra is fast and smooth and the camera is amazing especially for taking pictures of my newborn daughter",
            "Ok camera alright but not great lots of photos out of focus",
            "I upgraded from S20 Ultra to S21 Ultra, and everything is as good as I expected with one massive exception... they dropped the memory card slot???\n\nNot sure why Samsung choose this route, it is such a great selling point, I have a lot of stuff on my SD card which I can't use now.\n\nIf next year's phones don't have a SD card, then I will be swapping back to apple.",
            "The Samsung S21 is brilliant. Everything runs so smoothly and the camera is excellent. I love that you can take photos in 8k.",
            "Pre-order the phone, get delivered but i was the unlucky person because battery could barely hold charge for 4h. WFH and being on the zoom calls for upto 5h a days due that battery was dying on me every 4h. Cut the story s21 5g got battery issue. Phone have to charge 3 x time to go through a day. Disappointed samsung should have read the current situation where people are more dependent on the phone to work from home. Make the phone with battery to last long. What is the point of focusing on the camera where some of us locked inside the house. S21 5G could have been a better device if it has a decent battery.",
            "The cameraSSSSS are great as advertised. But the phone package as a whole could have been better if it has included the charger, the S-Pen and a case instead of buying it separately. If they can do it on the lower tier phone series, why cant they do it on their flagship phone.",
            "Pros.. super long battery, compared with my s10,  the same use for work using my work app S10 half of day but S21 Ultra full day going into night.\nVery nice and smooth quality.\nFast and super bright screen if needed.\nCamera choice and quality is outstanding.\nThe list goes on for ever.\nNegative.. no memory card expansion choice.\nNo headphone jack.",
            "Samsung galaxy 21 ultra is stylish strong build and so simple to use best android phone ever",
            "The phone is OK, style is nice and I quite like it but there are two things that have put me off, first is why the phone costs so much when you don't get anything in the box with it like no charger or ear phones, second I saw that it's scratch resistance when I brought the phone and my phone was in my pocket by itself when I took it out and saw there was a scratch.. so scratches so easy by the looks of it... disappointed",
            "I came from a Huawei p30 Pro to the Samsung s21 ultra and the only thing that's better and only slightly is the camera! The Huawei has a way better battery life and does everything this does",
            "Wow I love the s pen and its features among everything else,this phone is gonna be hard to improve on",
            "This phone is so sleek in its design and really easy to navigate if you have had a android phone I have not had a Samsung in about 4 years and coming back to them is the best thing I have done phone ways",
            "I love taking photos with new samsung s21 ultra.every single detail is there  so clear so real",
            "Love the speed of it, I used to have the S10+ which is a good phone but this phone is only slightly bigger, its faster and smarter, I love it",
            "I have the S21 Ultra after having the S10+ and I can honestly say it is the best phone Samsung have produced so far. Packed with great features, a big battery, amazing cameras and with S Pen support, it is head and shoulders above all of the competition.",
            "I have been an apple iPhone user for over 10 years and decided to try this mobile instead. I'm amazed, up to now it's fantastic but only used it for 2 days so only time will tell.camera is really special. The only let down is the lack of fast charge plug which is a real pain",
            "Beautifully designed and amazing performance couldn't be happier",
            "I totally love my  s21 ultra the camera is amazing the picture quality is fornominal. I love the size of the screen the amount of things i could comment on is endless highly recommended to all new phone searchers",
            "I have been a die hard Apple fan for 10 years but I was finding the iPhone 12 Pro max ( my upgrade from the 11pro max) not enough improvements to change in fact out dated, decided to switch to the new S21 Ultra, best thing I have ever done! I was a bit worried that the new Android system would be a bit beyond me of 60 years, but no, smart switch made the process so easy I should have switched years ago, the screen is amazing as is the whole phone itself it is so easy to use and too Many top things to mention, I very happy customer and looking forward to the forth coming mobiles, oh just one gripe, if only Samsung had face recognition like The iPhone it would be perfect.",
            "I gave it 3 stars because there are a few things I dislike or need improving.\n\nWith the UI 3 you cannot shorten the screen to remove the camera out of the way on app.\nThe front camera isnt flat and is slightly indented.\nBuggy OS - Samsung Keyboards keeps forgetting the key you selected to be to the left of the spacebar. Also, set to UK English, it displays some menu items in American English.\nHad a spam text, blocked the number but no option to report it.\nHeavier than the S10+\nOnly 512Gb where I had the S10+ 1TB before.\nThe phone is wide and with the flip case with the pen removed, its uncomfortable to hold.\nThe S-Pen works great but the lack of software restricts it tremendously.\nHolding in landscape to do a screenshot has the power / volume down opposite another button so easy to catch button on left side at the same time.\nPhone comes with lots of bloatware which needs uninstalling after setup.\nSamsung Cloud is being replaced with OneDrive but the integration of backing up your messages, settings etc isnt there so not sure what will be done.\nThe default home screen designs are repulsive but it never comes with a black only theme.\nThe AOD / lock screen cimes with a few more dynamic pics and the cats are almost all horid pics not like the usual Internet pics.\nRingtones have changed and only a few are ok so add your downloaded, paid for music.\nCamera is a pain as you may wish to take one pic but it may take one that is like a short video so I hate it when it is like that.\nIn all, as a phone its fine but as a replacement for a S10+ is a bad choice.",
            "Everything about my s21 Ultra is great. Amazing camera and screen with good battery life and just everything is great about it except for the call quality. I just can't understand what is going on. I had the S20 plus before and had no problems with using it left or right handed but with the 21 Ultra if I don't have it in just the right place on my left ear then I can't hear it. Very strange. It's not the cover or my hearing. It's definitely a problem with the phone. I have read about others having the same problem.",
            "My s9+ is miles better no memory card slot fingerprint scanner poor hate this phone.",
            "I don't love it. Unfortunately I've went from an s20+ to the s21 and dont see any improvements \nCamera same quality \nScreen same quality\nPhone calls dont work properly connection issues",
            "There are a few things I am disappointed with the first is the removal of the additional memory slot. The second is that I have had a galaxy S5 right up to the S21 and this screen is not as tough as previous screens to easy to scratch.",
            "Love this phone's cameras. The only thing I wish was better is sharpness of the photos. That is probably only thing why I did not put five stars. I love the possibility of using sPen on this phone. This phone looks very nice, is fast and reliable. Battery is quite good as well. \nDisplay is gorgeous and sound is also quite good! Really can't complain about anything besides sharpness of the photos and portrait mode could be better too. I love macro shots and zoom cameras on this phone.",
            "Stepped up from an s8 phone which was a great phone  to another gret phone  more features  that I really have not used to full extent  yet but overall very happy  with the phone the battery lasts about a full 24hr on normal  use",
            "Iv had my s21 ultra for a little while now and so far I'm loving it. I personally think the s21 ultra is the best phone in the world and being able to experience using such a good device is amazing!",
            "After last update it gets hot and shuts down. I cannot watch films or record videos without it overheating. Wish I had kept my s10 note plus. A very expensive pocket heater !",
            "Loving my new phone. The camera is just amazing it takes fantastic photos ź",
            "Only had my phone  one week,\nStill trying all  the amazing fichers,,",
            "I am not quite happy with my phone. It heats up so much after just a few minutes of make a  video call. This is so nice. I cannot make a call and chat at the same time because it always says phone too hot for multi window.  This is not nice",
            "Ive noticed that when using the device it can overheat from time to time and its kinda annoying. Also the fact it doesnt come with a charger is a little bit stupid!",
            "I am amazed at both the appearance and internal features of this phone! 8gb Ram is a great processor with incredible speed! The photo quality, clarity of pictures are phenomenal. Previously I was impressed with the Note 10 I had prior to this purchase.\n\nSamsung; you certainly never fail to impress. I am a very proud customer,  and I am forever grateful for your wonderful devices!",
            "I upgraded from a S10+ which was a good phone but thought it was time for a change, so pleased I did, this phone is AMAZING",
            "Love the phone taken some getting used too as the last phone I had was the Huawei p30 Pro must say still struggling to match the camera on my old phone other than that phone seems pretty decent",
            "Phone itself is pretty.\nPerformance is very lacking. Unable to perform multiple things without overheating. Received this notification twice. During covid I use messenger to video chat with my partner and if I do anything other than this, the phone will overheat. I have games on my phone that don't show up only in games launcher,which I found bizarre. Battery isn't brilliant, but it does charge quickly.",
            "Brilliant graphics and i can see the keyboard plus the sound is better than the S8 i must admit it makes the S8 look antiquated Very good all round phone and the battery is lasting me 5 days, over the moon with the purchase mick",
            "My last phone was a Note8, this S21 has amazing features and the camera is top",
            "I traded up when my s9 contract ended and I'm happy with the upgrade. It has a decent battery life and the the display is great and is surprisingly light for its size although I can't even justify to myself why it is so expensive so that's my only downgrade.",
            "I love the size of the phone i was so sick of phones getting bigger and bigger this phone is the perfect size, it has speed and good storage with it too i love it and would highly recomend it seriously, design is good to it really is grate, no down falls at all",
            "I've pre ordered s21 ultra upgrading from s7 after nearly 5 yrs,  and there so much to discover and explore got the Phantom Navy Absolutley loving the colour! A new thing that I have discovered and think it's an brilliant idea- I was watching a program and during an advert I picked my spen and started playing with the notes and realised that you can make the note page transparent, so you can write and watch without missing any parts of the program.",
            "Simply Excellent inside out! Was an IOS user for 9 years and decided about 2 yrs ago to try something else...I WOULD NEVER GO BACK. Started with Galaxy S10+, upgraded to S20 Ultra 128gb, then 512gb and now sold it and preordered the S21 Ultra 512gb...this item is not only extremely intelligent, but is very good looking. I believe Samsung did a great job in terms of design in the past few years ✌",
            "Absolutely beautiful display. Camera was a bit blurry, but with recent update the camera is crisp and definitely the phones biggest positive.  Does everything easily, and plenty of RAM for multitasking. Noticeably heavier than my s10+. Just don't drop it!!",
            "I have owned the Samsung galaxy about 8 Samsung phones over the years.. including all the S20's... But my S21 Ultra is off the scale!\n\nSimply speaking, there isn't ANYTHING you can't do with this phone..the camera is incredible and will detail every single bit of the subject.\nEvery possible positive adjective to describe this masterpiece comes into play..Truly stunning.",
            "I love the phone but the first day i had it in a pocket with a lighter, which managed to put deep noticeable scratches into the phone",
            "Loving the new camera pictures so sharp and crisp, bringing the colours to life. All the usual functions with 5G thrown in.",
            "Such a pretty phone! I bought the lilac one. This is my first Samsung and I love it! All the features are great. The camera is one of the best in the market,selfies or normal camera are really good. Definitely recommend this phone. I received the earbuds with it and i been using them since I received them. Great quality.I wouldn't mind if they were a bit smaller lol",
            "Such a big upgrade from the s20 ultra \nDefinitely worth upgrading!",
            "I base all my phone purchases on the camera and this is by far THE BEST one yet. Well done Samsung",
            "Why didn't I swap from iPhone sooner such a better operating system and the photography is unbelievable",
            "User friendly and great camera result. Love this beauty.",
            "The S21 Ultra puts the S20 Ultra in the shade.  Great upgrade to the display, battery, performance,and design. Well done Samsung.",
            "So lovely to use and works beautifully. The cameras are awesome.",
            "The quality is great, the images in low light are awesome, the AI really does what it's supposed to.",
            "I am really in love with this phone. Here are my thoughts (most of positive and some negative points).\nExcellent design, premium feel, class leading screen with 120 fps, superb performance and very good battery life. \nExcellent versatile camera setup, amazing macro & zoom camera (10 times optical zoom outstanding), one of the best all round day and night still photos. Very good video as well.\nThere are some areas it can do better with software update like low light video and shutter speed need to be improved as photos comes blurry if subject is moving. It also need to improve zoom in and out transition, it's little bit jerky and frame rate needs to be stable when taking low light video.\nOverall I can't see any other phone (including iPhone) better that Samsung galaxy s21 ultra right now.\nHighly Recommended, no need to have carry camera.",
            "Have had it little over 5 days now and I am totally impressed. I upgraded from the s10+ and it was worth it. The camera is amazing and fantastic at capturing night time pics, the 108mp sensor has amazing detail and the zoom is amazing for a fone. The screen at set at full resolution and 120hz has great colour contrast and depth. It really shows of your home recorded 8k videos. The speed of the processor and the 16gb ram included really allows you to use multiple apps effortlessly and switch in and out of each very quickly. The s-pen, (sold separately) wenworking with this fone is also a joy to use and a lovely addition. It's great for making notes and for those that enjoy sketching on apps like Adobe draw etc. Overall the fone looks and performs great and has no complaints from me at all. Love love love it.",
            "Great phone but the camera pictures taken don't look any better than the s10e which is why im thinking of going back to s10e",
            "I just love it all I had the s10 before and I thought that was good but this s215g is better faster and liter",
            "Moved to this from the note 20 ultra and cannot fault it .. great battery and performance and the camera is outstanding",
            "I have been samsung phone user for years and I've not been disappointed not even with the s21 ultra great phone and the cameras are superb. Only niggle I have is the 45 days wait for my buds Pro and smart tag where I have been reading on members page most people have already had them.",
            "Huge Samsung fan. Adore my tablet & S pen. Loved my S9.\nThis is just terrible. Just purchased & hate it. No benefits over a very cheap phone and it's not a cheap phone.  Lacks wow factor. Feel mean posting negatives for one of my favourite tech companies, but this has missed every mark.",
            "I have the phone for 2 days and i can't put it down.\nThe new camera features are amazing.\nGreat picture..amazing sound..Samsung did a great job with this phone.\nIt feels premium and it is really easy to use.\nI thought my S10+ was amazing..but this..is a game changer!",
            "Didn't think I would get on with a bigger screen but love it. It's so crisp. It's speedy doing tasks, trying to work out camera setting still but nice device so far.",
            "Pros: Fantastic screen and camera, Plenty of processing power, build quality excellent.\n\nCons: No charger? No SD card? Camera protrudes more than anticipated. No 1Tb version. Not the greatest of colour options even with Samsung exclusives. No S-pen.",
            "The S21 ULTRA  is the best Samsung phone I've had \nWell built from quality materials. \nSuper fast on the 5G network. \nI  found it easy to transfer all my saved settings from my previous phone. \nLook forward to the S22 ULTRA next year.",
            "Phone a delight to use with all the extras and easy to get round no problem does everything you want from a phone.",
            "Absolutely great mobile , great customer service, received my phone really quickly,",
            "I went from the s8+ to the 21 ultra and honestly it's the best thing I've done all year. Screen size is amazing, s-pen features are great and the memory + battery life are simply fantastic. Wish my hands were bigger to be able to hold the phone more easily though no fault of the s21 ultra. Down side for me is that I don't own bluetooth headphones and so I have to buy in addition to the phone.",
            "I done the dreaded Cross deck/switch up to android on the Samsung s21 Ultra, and wow the whole platform is so customizable.",
            "This phone is a genuine hardware marvel and possibly the most advanced phone ever built to date. At least on a hardware level. It is a blazingly fast phone with remarkable features especially in the camera department. When taking photos this phone is incredible. Night mode is superb as are photos taken with any of the four cameras especially the zoom cameras which are brilliantly stabilized and take great pictures even up to 30x. How it has the stabilization and hardware to genuinely take non blurry and quite passable pictures at 100 x is astonishing and really brought a smile to my face. The phone can get a little hot when using the camera though I feel. Video is not good to be honest. Yet. I love shooting 4k 60fps video and on my old Note 9 this is a joy but on my Exynos 512Gb  S21 ultra the low light video quality is poor in comparison with much more noise and there is a stabilization problem on the 10x camera when recording 4k 60fps video on it. To me these are all fixable software problems that the right updates can rectify. I have faith in you Samsung and I believe you will get the video problems sorted and make this phone a genuine piece of perfection. I really look forward to this.",
            "Value for money compared to other phones. Fantastic camera. Quick charge. Graphics A+. Fast processor. Only downside is no memory card slot even though was advertised with.",
            "My s21ultra is amazing, I thought my note 10 plus was an awesome piece of kit, but the s21 ultra blows it right out of the water, shout out to samsung.",
            "I love this phone, I really do. However, I'm going to start off this review with the only negative I've found so far, the lack of SD card support. With a phone costing this much and it being an Android phone, it shouldn't have this feature missing. Even if it's a feature only a minority use (which I highly doubt is the case), but I think it should still be a feature, especially since it can record up to 8k video, and not everyone likes using cloud services to store photos and videos.\n\nOther than this negative, I'm absolutely loving the phone, the screen is beautiful like always, the battery so far is good, no issues there. Everything about this phone is premium, but the lack of SD card support almost had me switch to Google and at one point over to iOS as the SD card support was one of the reasons I loved Android/Samsung phones. I'd love to see the return and the continued support for SD cards. Keep features the competition doesn't have, don't lose them.",
            "Just upgraded and already with the camera and battery life",
            "Absolutely love my s21 ultra I have nothing bad to say about it at all",
            "I upgraded from S9 to S21, its got great features and amazing camera, recommended.",
            "Best please I've ever had love the camera, the screen resolution and all the extra features",
            "I upgraded to the s21 ultra and have found out it no longer works with my gearvr",
            "Couldn't recommend this phone enough, light weight, easy to use, brilliant camera. Loads of storage. What's not to love?",
            "Ideal little phone, not as powerful as I'd hoped after coming from the Note 9 and has issues with maintaining its display when too many apps are open and I hate the keyboard. Visually displays are stunning, response times are good, camera works well. Although next time I think waiting and being able to get the ultra style version at a reasonable price would be a better idea for what I want my phone to do. Ideally this is a phone for basic users not those who are used to higher end performance.",
            "It is amazing phone and have a very good camera. \nBut was nice to come with charger in the box.",
            "Love everything about it. Build design cameras I don't even miss the headphones jack or charger",
            "The enhancements are brilliant especially relating to the battery, camera and speed in comparison with the S20. Very happy with my new toy for 2021. What next... for the S22",
            "Its a update from all all previous devices. Definitely worth it.",
            "It's taken a few days to transfer old data to the Ultra but it's worth the effort, learning about what it can do and how to get the best out of it. Happy days...",
            "I love my galaxy s21 ultra the display is crisp the camera is good and the overall quality of the phone is great ! The only issue I've found is that I've only had the phone out the box 3 days and already when I'm using certain apps it shuts them down all of a sudden with no warning..  weather this is a software issue or the phone itself not sure but on the whole 95/100 :)",
            "Had my s21 ultra a week now and love it, great features and the screen is so cool",
            "Upgrade from the S10+ and this is a massive improvement the battery life is outstanding. Not found a single fault.",
            "It's just like the s20 but the camera is better and you can use the s pen down fall no room for extra memory",
            "The S21 ultra 5G so far has been so amazing. Its so fast and the camera quality just blows you away. Only problem i have with this phone is the finger print scanner. Even though ive registered my finger print. When logging into different apps it doesnt seem to recognise my prints. Ive taken them off and registered but still have the problem. Hope they can have some update to fix this problem maybe. And going from a note 9 to the s21 i wouldve thought the size would be slightly smaller,but its as big as my previous note 9. All in all i love this phone. Just hope the finger print scanner was more sensitive",
            "Same phone as last year but with no SD card slot? Only got mine for the buds Pro, if I didn't have the upgrade programme I wouldn't have bothered.\n\nTake us back to the days of S5. Removable battery, headphone jack, SD slot AND waterproof. Best phone Samsung have ever made and they've stripped features since.",
            "I have only had this phone for three days and I love it already. It's very quick, the sound quality is great as is the picture quality. Currently exploring what the camera can do, so far I am really impressed.",
            "This is a lovely phone. Super quick, superb camera . BUT\nI also purchased a genuine ,Samsung clear view case. I have had this phone 2 weeks now\n When it's not in use it is in a trouser pocket, on its own. No keys or change.  The clear part of the case has become very scratched which in turn has badly scratched my lovey phone screen. I have emailed  Samsung but waiting for a reply.",
            "It's best phone at this moment , before I used a S10+ with 8Gb ram , at S21 ultra was a great idea if you.put a display with 144hz, but 120its ok, camera it's a very good one, deserve every £.",
            "I have been using Samsung Products for a very long time! I just upgraded from a Samung Galaxy Note 9 and I am very intrigued by the new design and features of the Galaxy S21 ultra, I love the software, amazing battery life and exquisite camera quality. I am waiting for my Galaxy buds Pro to arrive and I am excited to use then. \nThank you Samsung, keep up the good work!",
            "Fantastic picture and Video.  Very easy to use. Lots of features waiting to be discovered. Very fast operating.",
            "Love samsung been with them for 13 years wouldn't have any other phone",
            "Excellent quality very sleek and great features only down side it don't come with a charger only cable",
            "Battery is excellent easily get you through the day for casual use. Display is great. Loving the camera. Would definitely recommend.",
            "The phone is great but have noticed by battery dies too quickly. Can this be sorted",
            "This is an incredible phone. It's very powerful, smooth and will handle anything you throw at it. Movies and entertainment are immersive, the sound is really good. Productivity is excellent and the S Pen support is genius, although you need to get the S Pen and case separately it's so worth it. The case works well with the phone and the Pen is comfortable and easy to use - it's very handy to have for all sorts of tasks. Although I've used several different devices for different tasks before, I've started using the Ultra as my sole device as I'm often on the move. \nYou pay a lot for these devices but the Ultra is worth every penny and more. It's really exciting what Samsung have been doing and they've really excelled themselves this time.",
            "Upgraded from s10+. An amazing phone, the camera is the best!",
            "I have used the samsung note series for years and also had experience with iphones. This time decided to go with the s series mainly because the s-pen would be optional. The ultra series has the extra camera features with greater use for memory... and this should have bean recognised by keeping the memory card option or at least in he ultra series, also having the pen optional so should a pen slot be optional? Or just stick to the note series? Now that the camera's are alot more advanced and having 50x and 100x zoom having to touch the screen to change this obscures the screen therefore partly stopping me from seeing what I am taking a photo of until I move my hand then zoom again... a better zooming option or scroll to zoom wheel would be a nice feature.  Price, no memory card option, no s-pen holding option and poor camera zooming design to take advantage of the camera and 100x zoom is the reason for my score.",
            "My beloved S10+ Ceramic Black was my favourite Galaxy phone of all time, and I've owned many Samsung phones since the Omnia SGH-i900!\nI was saddened to trade that in towards the brand new S21 Ultra 5G 512GB (Phantom Silver), but the new phone is LEAGUES superior to my previous one, which was a workhorse!\n\nI do a lot of amateur photography, mostly based around my watches, and my S10+ taught me lots in pro shooting.\nThe S21 Ultra ups this on a big scale, from 12-bit RAW pictures for editing later in Photoshop Lightroom and Express, to the extra 16GB's of RAM for more grunt.\n\nThe gorgeous 2K screen with adaptive 120Hz refresh rate is obscenely beautiful to look at and enjoy, and makes my editing very precise.\nExtra battery capacity, better camera modules, super slick One UI 3.1, Bixby routines (macro level automation) with Smart Things, ...I can keep listing away the various features I enjoy.\n\nThough not yet used my other big draw was finally S-pen support for an S series phone.\nMy first stylus phone was the Omnia SGH-i900, then years later Note II & 3. I've missed pen support, especially with my style of photography and editing, but now that this is available and with official and third party stylus support I can finally do accurate and precise work on my phone.\nI'm waiting for the S-pen Pro release but just happy that this is something available for the S21 Ultra.\n\nThere's so much to discuss but my time thus far with my new phone, and the joy of working on it, especially on photography, has made me extremely happy.\n\nWonderful high-tech product and a worthy title for Ultra!",
            "Lots of new tech. Takes an excellent photo. Storage is good.  Lovely size screen.\nGlad I got this version rather the an iPhone.",
            "Love the phone and comes with screen protector on it very fast compared to the s9 I had amazing pictures not to pricey I just love it",
            "Watching reviews of this phone comparing it between the Exynos chip 2100 vs the Snapdragon sd888 version. I can finally say we a phone worthy to call it a flagship. The previous generation we had the Exynos 990 when compared to the Snapdragon. 20% better in all areas. Read the reviews. The UK we had no choice but to get the Exynos 990 version. So finally we can get a phone you can call ultra.",
            "Well to say I'm disappointed is understatement as the tougher glass is infact not as dropped on to Karndean flooring so not that hardest surface in the world and shattered the back glass so I found the s20 ultra better as I'd dropped that a few times with not break the glass back! Other thing is battery life is poor even with power save mode on and gets hot while charging or like now while typing this the back is getting rather warm.",
            "It's a very great phone overall I just have one problem it's making a weird rattling noise when I shake it",
            "I came from an S9+ to the S21 Ultra. It makes more sense than the s21+. Simply the best phone on the market. Everything about it screams quality. However, Samsung left this range open to criticism. They should have stuck with the 45watt fast charging (though I understand the reason for not going for the insane speeds others are doing) and given the customer the option to have the charger or not. The SD memory should have stayed, a basic requirement for a device this expensive. However I mainly miss the iris scanner in these mask wearing days (tho unlocking with my Galaxy Watch Active 2 is pretty slick). I have not had much need for an sPen but I still love that the Galaxy S now has that capability. I got one with my S6 Tab Lite and its nice to have that seemless integration.\n\nOn a side note, the kickstand on the tough Samsung case is made of play dough. Seriously, it can't support the weight of the phone. It's terrible. I have However swapped it for the stand from the S9+ case which is much more durable. Also with this case on, its near impossible to align the GwA2 watch for reverse charging.\nI am also slightly underwhelmed by the camera. I'm not sure what I expected to be honest, but pictures always feel over sharpened. \n\nThis reads like a list of hate, but actually this is  one of the best computers I have ever bought. DeX on board is the reason why I upgraded my phone and not my laptop. Octacore processor and 12gb RAM? That'll do nicely. If Windows 10 or a full Linux distro ever ran natively in DeX, I don't think I'd buy another Computer again. Mind you, that would also make owning a tablet worthwhile too.",
            "No one reads more than 3 lines on a review so started on the SGA then s7 s9 s10 s21 puts them all to shame and the last 3 were good done",
            "Gorgeous phone. Really impressed in performance and screen quality.",
            "I purchased this from Argos as i did not have to wait few days to arrive directly from Samsung. Argos website offered free ear buds- however the Samsung website tells me that the offer has expired. I have now ended up purchasing a top of the range from Argos and no ear buds and no support. I went back to store and the store in Watford told me to take it up with Samsung on their website, not very helpful!",
            "From the s8 plus to this, world of difference, shame the s pen case wasn't cheaper",
            "I thought this phone would be leagues ahead of the z flip, but the z takes better pictures, which shocked me. Also, tbe s21 takes longer to charge wirelessly.",
            "Great phone very fast Tempted to get 21 ultra though",
            "Had the s10+ and was impressed by the quality of photos and the phone but this is next level. Love the improved stability on the 100x zoom too !",
            "Display unrivalled, battery life great, great sound, smoothness of navigation incredible, camera outstanding. This is street's ahead of anything available today. Wow.",
            "I really like this phone. However I do prefer Pixel's post processing of images (vary rare to get blurry photos on Pixel). And I miss the microSD card reader.",
            "Been using Samsung for last few years for phones, S7, S9 then note 9. This is a somewhat reluctant upgrade as I wasn't keen on losing sd card support and headphone jack. No regrets from upgrade, I like smaller phone body. Don't miss loss of QHD display as never used this on note or S phones. Love variable 120hz refresh makes everything seem slicker and faster. The screen is truly edge to edge now, looks fantastic and now it's flat, so no accidental touches when you grip it. * mine came with preapplied screen protector* it still  has dual sim, split screen and one ui which is updated like android 11. Dex is such a bonus now it can be used over wifi, your smart TV can now be a pc and all your function on a larger screen. Get it while there are free Bluetooth buds live as these are so comfortable for long listening sessions. There are cheaper android phones but none as feature packed and good value as the 'vanilla' s21",
            "This is my 2nd Samsung Galaxy Smartphone & it's even better than my 1st one!!\nThe sharpness of the screen/display & the vibrant colours are TERRIFIC.\nThe actual operation of the Smartphone is so SMOOTH.\nThe Camera is FABULOUS & the Zoom is AMAZING too.",
            "S21 Ultra is fast, responsive and the design is amazing. Great features and it cameras are great. I am using galaxy phones since S 3 and have always been happy. You will not be disappointed with this phone, it is just great at everything you need to do.  Battery life could be bit better. I was worried about the size and weight of the phone but I'm getting used to it now. \nI just wish that Samsung would also introduce astrophotography mode like we see on other phones or at least allow for even longer exposure time. \nAnd yes, exynos processor in EU heats up more and still its performance is not on par with Snapdragon. Samsung should really stop punishing EU customers with exynos.",
            "It's a great phone but I am finding apps keep closing themselves on occasion",
            "So had it nearly 2 weeks now and it's impressive. I upgraded from note 8 which i also loved. So far so good lots of features to workout and play with I mainly wanted due to cameras and also s pen support the same as I had on the note I definitely feel at home with this device. The one disappointing area I feel is the NIGHT MODE on photos and videos I think was expecting more and found to be quite grainy but still early days yet",
            "Easy to use and excellent cameras",
            "Loving it so far, new features still yet to discover. The camera is incredible and the quality of the phone is very much a huge upgrade to my previous smartphone. Plus the phantom violet doesn't get any less beautiful every time you see it.",
            "After only having the s20 ultra for less than a year I seen the s21 ultra and thought wow it looks amazing which it does. \n\nBut when comparing the both models there is not much difference. \n\nI do love my Galaxy's and glad I upgraded but wish there was a massive difference between the both",
            "Everything about this phone is great, the camera quality etc is even better than before.",
            "Really helps capture the moment, and looking forward to some Galaxy Buds too! I'm loving my S21 Ultra, and recommend it if you're in need of a new phone, the camera is amazing, the display too!\n\nMy only complaint is it's a little awkward for left-handed use, which is my dominant hand.",
            "Poor battery life easly get 2 days out of mate p20 pro charging Samsung by 6pm.poor signal on 4g and calls",
            "Without doubt this is the best Galaxy phone I have had. I thought the S20 Ultra was good but the S21 Ultra is a massive step forward.",
            "I love the s21 ultra it has loads of new features I know they took a few out to save on cost but gutted they took away the sd support as content creatures ot new creators who will use the directors view will use ali the memory within s few videos and like me I don't own my own PC to back stuff onto",
            "Have had a samsung since the original galaxy then 2 years ago decided to change and get a Huawei p30 Pro. Regretted it almost instantly! Had been swaying on getting the s20 then with the release of the s21 decided to take the plunge and get the ultra. From the moment I switched it on I knew I'd made the right decision. Anytime I found myself thinking ah wish I could do that, a quick search and there was the option to customise exactly how I wanted! The camera quality is out of this world and I can see the single shot function being well used. Only slight negative is that the battery isn't quite as great as I'd have expected but then I have been very heavily using it since I got it so hoping that gets better as it adapts to my usage. Overall absolutely delighted with it, and don't think I'll ever step away from samsung again.",
            "The phone is really efficient. The camera is packed with lodes of options.",
            "Loving the phone. However, c'mon Samsung give us a proper charger! Headphones would have been nice too but a charger at least. Was disappointed",
            "Normally I'd bang on about all the different things I like about a phone, I did with the S20, but there were a couple of things that just fell a little bit short of making it awesome.\nThe S21 is AWESOME, I feel Samsung got it all right this time, I mean, they really excelled themselves this time. I just don't know what else to say.",
            "Everything from the user interface to the camera is just amazing. Great battery life, would have been good to get the 45w charger with the Ultra. Other than that, it's brilliant.",
            "I love everything about this I have had all the Samsung s line and the ultra are the best one.",
            "Amazing phone in every aspect however it heats up like crazy when I use camera for video recording for more than 5 minutes. I've contacted Samsung and if this doesn't get resolved I'm gonna have to return the phone and get an iPhone. I've been using it for more than a week now but the problem persists",
            "Replaced my s10+ with the s21 ultra and I couldn't be happier. Can't understand customers moaning about the lack of earphone Jack and sd card slot just a little research before purchase you'd have seen the spec's.",
            "Love everything about this device but hate bixby assistant and would rather if the interface unit was less packed full of things I'm never going to use. Low lighting photos aren't the best in comp to the iPhone 12 max however the resolution during day time shots is incomparable.",
            "Yes it is a great phone, camera is good and I agree with most of what has been said.\nHOWEVER,  my music and  ring tones define MY phone. I can't get my music from my S10+ on to Samsung music in the S21 ultra. None of it plays, so I can't put music as my ringtone. This is a major problem for me and I am stuck with pants tone in the phone or pay for another app.\nThis may seem a small problem but it has really has tainted my enjoyment of the phone.",
            "Came back to samsung from huawei. I go where the best mobile cameras are at a certain period in time. So far, the device is as smooth as butter. Sound is fantastic, battery life is very good, managing 9 hours plus of screen on time with around 30% left of battery. Like my previous samsung, the cameras, particularly the wide angle cameras suffer from oversharpening and softness. I'm sure updates will resolve this issue. The 108mp camera, produces some beautiful shots, it really does. Some.noise work on the sensor algorythm will produce even more stunning images. Special mention to one ui 3. I love it. Overall, i'm very happ to come back to samsung. \n\nPs. Here's a picture of the beautiful s21 ultra with the teardown skin on.",
            "Upgraded from S10 5G and where do i start,the cameras are fantastic,even the ×100 is ridiculously good.!! The display is beyond any other competitor,bright and colourful ,the list is endless. Well impressed after 2 weeks!!",
            "I love my s21 ultra the phone fixes all the issues I had with the s20 ultra, but and it's only a small one the pro camera app still doesn't support the 3x and 10x zoom yes you can do digital but it is really pointless considering the fact it has these as optical zoom producing much much better results if they fix this then I would give this phone 5 stars",
            "I upgraded from the S20 ultra 5g (amazing phone).\nThe battery doesn't seem to last half as long as the S20 did, maybe its still learning my usage to be fully optimised. Overall although there are improvements they're not always that obvious, maybe if I wasn't on an upgrade anytime plan and waited 2 years between handsets I'd notice the upgrades more, but Samsung are starting to feel like the reason I ditched IPhone. The camera is phenomenal (I'm no pro photographer). The design like most Samsung phones just looks and feels amazing. I wouldn't discourage people from upgrading to this phone but feel if you've got the S20 ultra maybe hold out to notice the changes. The score seems tight at 3 but if I was paying for handsets in cash or paying to upgrade early I wouldn't be happy.",
            "I upgraded from the Note 10 + 5G to S21 Ultra in Phantom Navy. Absolutely love the phone.\nThe screen is out of this world! Camera is absolutely unbelievable and the processing speed is remarkable. \nBattery life leaves a little to be desired but at the moment that is due to the device still learning my usage habits. No doubt, that will improve as time goes on (did the same on the Note), I use max everything to get the full experience.\nThe phone coupled with the Galaxy Buds Pro is absolutely fantastic. \nI would buy another for my wife if I had the money. Better start saving.\n\n5 stars no question",
            "I'll keep it simple. You get what you pay for and with Samsung, you get quality...",
            "Great phone works well sometimes sluggish but not that it deteriotes the functions",
            "Very impressed with this phone the camera is just fantastic! I upgraded from the s20 Ultra and so glad I did. Its quick and responsive. Definitely recommend this phone. I'm.a massive Samsung fan every year they just get better and better.",
            "Its all samsung promissed much faster better looking one thing i hope they crack is a full 4k hdr at 120hz display that will ve the game changer that evwryone is waiting for.",
            "What a piece of kit, camera is amazing, best phone on the market at the moment.",
            "I've never been a Samsung fan before and this is only my third device coming in from Huawei, HTC and apple before that. I had the S20 and like most people suffered with the dodgy autofocus on the main camera. I also constantly worried about it overheating as it definitely got hot especially if giving it a full charge from 0-100%.\n\nThe new S21 Ultra addresses lots of the issues of its predecessor but still has the same main issue which really really frustrates me. Living in Europe we were stuck with the inferior version of this handset. Why we are forced to suffer with the long Failing Exynos chip I will never understand, tests and reviews have shown up to 20% better performance with the American Snapdragon Variant and this device still runs hot. It's annoying we are forced to accept such differences.",
            "Absolutely Everything, the style, the look, I always upgrade with a Samsung my last device was the Samsung  Galaxy S7 Edge.\nAll I can say is my new Samsung s21Ultra  s a Work of Art...",
            "I'm super super impressed with this phone. I upgraded from the s10+ to the s21 ultra and I'm amazed at the difference of the device. The fluidity on screen due to the adaptive display along with the wqhd+ resolution really makes this screen great to look at. They've updated the finger print scanner which is alot more easier to use coming from the s10 model, still getting used to the height of it but I'm not noticing any delay and the unlock is instant. The way the volume rocker on screen appears is much more cleaner and I love the notification bar (when you scroll from the top) and how it's somewhat translucent and separates the notifications nicely. The cute animoji update so I can have my dancing self as my lock screen is super fun. And the camera is absolutely brilliant - I csnt even explain how amazing it is, I took a picture of my hand and all the creases and lines were so visible, I cant even see those clearly with my naked eye. So all in all, I absolutely love this device. Thank you samsung, truly makes my life abit better when a tech freak like me has a device that actually is worth the hype.",
            "Phone looks nice albeit heavier than my s10+ and partners s20 ultra.\nPhone heats up very quickly.\nCharger supplied is a C to C no actual USB end... so not really better for environment as having to order everything new.\nLack of aux a hindrance and also worse for environment as having to order extras to be able to connect Phone to car etc.\nCameras not bad, think I need to play with it or download some app as quality just looks a little better if not the same as s10 to me really, few shots and videos I've taken are blurry.",
            "So let's get started, I've owed all s series and note series upto S10 and note 10.\nS21 ultra is a hmmm phone. I'm not going to talk about storage or charger.\n\nPros:\n- So display great. 120hz love\n- speakers great audio top-notch\n- spen from my tab s7 plus works great\n\nCons:\n- Battery life not great I charge more often and only use about 4 hrs of youtubing. That's it. No gaming and crazy multitasking. Big issue.\n- network connection not good. I've tried same Sim in s10plus and it's great.\n- camera are ok but gainny. Considering pixel count expected more. Focus not as good. My S10 plus takes just as good if not sometimes better.\n- fingerprint sensor just bad. 3 out of times doesn't pick up my fingerprint.\n- no good tempered screen protectors\n\nLook I genuinely think Samsung are becoming the boring apple like company except apple can deliver. I think this will be my last year with Samsung and I will be moving to another Android brand.",
            "Wow, this phone has really impressed me! I upgraded from the s10 plus and I'm really impressed with this new device. The screen is world class and the cameras are so versatile that it's hard not to take photos whenever you are out and about. One of the best features I have found, which is a vast improvement from my old device, is the haptic feedback! It makes typing on this device much more interactive. Overall, it does everything you want from a flagship device and more!",
            "Simply amazing!!! Definitely worth every penny!!!!",
            "The camera on this phone truly is stunning. It make high end cameras look a little weak.. as a daily driver I can’t recommend this enough, an all round cracker for business use and usability.",
            "S20 and S21 one next the other still S20 have a nicer display, plastic on the back on S21 feel cheap, camera seems to make better one shoot pictures but the little extra battery and missing features when compared with the S20 completely distroying the experience",
            "The s21 ultra is a great phone. It seems Samsung has taken all that was wrong with the S20 range and put it right. The 120hz, qhd screen now works. The rear of the phones are a Matt finish, so less fingerprints. The laser focus has sorted out the focus issues.  Android 11 has been added given the UI an even better, smoother experience. \nThe exynos 2100 chip is a big improvement over that aweful 990 chip used last year. However it's still falling short of the USA s21 equivalent. The Snapdragon 888. ( But it is more than enough for most)\nThe cameras are great and probably the best out right now. \nI like the fact the s21 ultra has a less curved screen. However for me I'd prefer a completely flat screen and I know quite a few that would as well. However this is subjective. Others may prefer the curved screen. \nAs it stands Samsung have done a great job with the s21 range. It truly is a big improvement over the already great S20 range. \nAns now with s pen integration, what more could.you ask for.",
            "I'm an average size man and my thumb struggles to reach the top of the screen to swipe down. Definitely a two hand job phone.",
            "This is the best phone I have had so far, excellent quality cameras, sound quality is pretty good, warms up more than my previous phones (time will tell if this becomes a problem  !!) I would of give 5 stars but I had to buy a separate charger and may have to buy a pair of headphones so only the 4 stars ( a phone of this quality and price should come with a charger at least !!)",
            "What a fantastic phone to use, so quick and everything flows nicely. Definitely the best phone I have had the pleasure to use because of the intuitive AI system and amazing display.",
            "Stunning screen, amazing camera, incredibly quick!",
            "I have changed from an S8 to the S21 and I must say that I am a little disappointed. The phone does not come with Samsungs flagship SD card port, meaning that when I transferred all my docs, the phone memory was nearly full. If I'd have know this beforehand I would have ordered the bigger memory. Instead I am now expected to pay a monthly subscription for cloud storage. No charger plug came with the phone, again disappointing as I now have to use my old charger cable as I do not have a plug that supports the new cable. It's a shame that everything that Samsung slated Apple for, they have now done themselves.",

WOW amazed by it amazing phone picture quality is stunning & I can't say I have a single thing to criticise! best move I've made and certainly never changing from samsung again",
            "I have had each of the upgrades each year since the S7 Edge and this is rather predictably the best phone so far.\n\nHaving moved from the S20 Ultra, I find a much more refined implementation in the S21 Ultra.\n\nThe black is rich and deep, retaining much of the light that his it.  The design bold and striking....a real improvement on last year.\n\nThis is driven by the camera, which this year really owns the space on the phone...it feels like the phone was built around the cameras and the screen... Again an improvement on last year, where the camera felt like it was such on at the least minute.\n\nThe improvements aren't simply cosmetic though, they make a difference in the usability of this device. \n\nThe screen is, as we have come to expect, very much at the cutting edge. Rich vivid colours, which really pop from the black. Silky smooth in use thanks to the adaptive refresh rate, which can now be used with the phones full resolution switched on. This gives a fantastic user experience when using the phone.\n\nWe also find an improved fingerprint reader, which means far fewer failed attempts to unlock the screen - although there may still be the odd occasion where this still happens.\n\nFinally for me, this year's addition of Wacom support to the S21 Ultra has been very welcome. I have been using the silicone case and S pen since getting the phone a week ago and couldn't be without it - although I think it's like Note like integration of the pen, rather than the case. \n\nThe case itself is ok, although the black isn't as deep as that on the phone itself, and it does add some width to the phone itself.\n I hope we start to see third party cases which incorporate pen storage. \nImportant to note that third party Wacom pens can be used with the phone. There are already some great options out there, and who knows, perhaps we may get a Parker option one day!! \n\nThe cameras here are a very clear and marked improvement.\n\nZoom is far more usable and the images are fantastic. This phone which not disappoint those who are interested in mobile photography.\n\nMy battery life is about the same as it was on the S20 Ultra, but I am a heavy user, with most of the home (media and automation) being read from my phone.\n\nI have still noticed some heating, but I am using the phone in the silicone case.\n\nMy phone was pre-ordered through EE, I have claimed my Buds pro, and tag and waiting for them to arrive - claiming isn't too difficult, but I do wish that they would arrive with the phone.\n\nTo sum up, a great phone that delivers in most areas. \n\nModel used - S21 Ultra 512 GB With 16 GB RAM",
            "This is far the best Samsung phone they keep getting better and better there phones are so easy to use even for a older person like me i will never  use another make ever again",
            "Amazing speed . The screen is crisp and Vibrant. As for the cameras  wow",
            "Changed from a Google pixel 4xl and it hasn't disappointed. Love it",
            "Camera doesn't dissapoint, although to get clear 100x zoom shots you really need a stand. 12GB of RAM 256 ROM, RAM alone is double iPhone 12 MAX PRO. It doesn't let down anywhere else once you're used to what you've lost & gained. S Pen is a nice touch for this phone",
            "I am a big fan of Samsung way better then any other android or IPHONE out there seen they first introduce the new galaxy I have so far had all of them it just keeps getting better an better every year this is one the best Samsung phones iv had in years my last Samsung was the S10 5G the features on the GALAXY ULTRA is the best an the camera its just WOW I just hope Samsung keeps doing what they do best...\n\nAnyone that's going for reviews don't waste your time add the ULTRA TO YOUR BASKET trust me you will not regret it i have already purchased 10 for family members an they are loving it.",
            "Upgraded to the S21 Ultra and wow what a phone super speed excellent camera and sleek looks .\nThis is by far Samsungs best phone to date",
            "What can I say apart from it's simply the best Samsung have excelled themselves with the s21 Ultra 5g.",
            "Was hesitant to leave apple after having them for the last 8 years but its a choice which I wish I made sooner camera is amazing video quality and stabilisation is superb screen is smooth love everything about it",
            "The s21 ultra 5g has so many great features that it's going to take me weeks to explore them all. The camera is superb and it was really easy to transfer the data from.  my old phone . Nothing negative to report so far. One of my friends loves my phone so much that he's ordered one for himself.  Battery life seems pretty good too and the screen res is brilliant.",
            "The s21 ultra is so quick faster than my note 10 lite i found godies on my phone that are good and funny, the photos are superb best camera i have used the phone is so good that my wife is looking to get one she is using a s20 5g and that is good one our house is just samsung everything lol just so good. Many thanks for a special phone.",
            "Camera, display and performance is simply amazing. Battery life is great too.. All day long despite heavy usage. My only complaint is phone is heavier especially as I'm switching from S10+",
            "I have been a loyal Samsung fan since 2014 but this S21 Ultra has quickly become my favourite phone of all time. The 10x on this phone produces stunning photos with natural blur which my friends thought were directly from a DSLR. Highly recommended!!",
            "Love my new Galaxy S21 Ultra. Amazing phone top cameras. Exynos 2100 is much better compared to old exynos chips. \nReplaced my Galaxy S9 big performance jump.",
            "If you are looking for a no no nonsense phone with a high quality camera, for all the pictures you want to take. Then this is the phone for you. If you are looking for a phone that is powerful, if that is for mobile gaming, or for multi tasking, this is also the phone for you. The power this phone has makes it so easy to do everything you want it to. \n\nBut one issue you will have is the fact that it does not support micro SD, but it does not have to be the kicker that you think. You can get around that issue by backing up images to the cloud and then removing them from your system storage. \n\nThis phone also supports the S Pen if that is something that may interest you, you do not have a place to doc the pen on the phone. So you will have to get a case for it. But the fact that the S series of phone now supports the S Pen is amazing it opens up the eco system just that little bit more for everyone that keeps it Samsung.",
            "The S21 Ultra has really built upon the soild foundations of the S20 Ultra, improving all the things that required attention and adding in great new features (like S-Pen support). It looks, feels and performs to the 'Ultra' name. I am exceptionally happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking to discover the Rolls Royce of Smartphones!",
            "My S21 ultra is absolutely faboulous, the cameras are just incredible and the design speechless. Well done and good job, happy with the S7 tab as well, simply love the last devices.",
            "What can I say other than WOW!!!\nI was lucky enough to have my husband buy me the S20 for my birthday in October last year,  but when I saw that I was actually eligible for an upgrade with Sky to this epic phone, I grabbed the swap with both hands!! And I get a free pair of Galaxy Earbuds thrown in as a Samsung member benefit! Retail price on the buds alone, more than outweighs the cost of upgrading to this absolute behemoth! \nI can't understand why other reviewers have given it 1 or 2 stars due to its overheating and short battery life! I didn't experience any of this with my Ultra handset, so can't empathise with these low scores on the doors Miss Ford!! Hahaha!\nThe stacked performance of this beautiful phone will mark a line in history as one of the most powerful featured phones, just on its picture & video performance alone!\nThe ingenuity of the design with its ultra clean and crisp edge to edge display, with a legendary refresh rate and with Dolby Atmos audio playback, it will keep you entertained for hours and hours!\nI'm going to leave my review there for now, because I've only had the phone for 3 days and I have so much more to explore and experience! \nWell done Samsung! I didn't think that you could top the Note 10, but you beat it into a cocked hat and then some!\nCan't wait to update my review when I've had a chance to have a proper look around!\nBe safe and take care all!!",
            "Beautiful phone and brilliant camera  and it's also lightweight .  However, for me the only downside is the fingerprint facility as  this function does not work when there is a glass screen protector, this is a let down.",
            "Great little beast, does every thing I want and more. Slightly bigger than the Hauwei but easier to use. I find I can use the keyboard faster, more fluently and less mistakes. The Home and Lock screen picture seems brighter and clearer as well. Glad to have bought it. Thank you.",
            "This is what I always wanted Great mobile welldone",
            "Amazing photo quality not had a phone we're I could actually zoom into the face of the moon",
            "If you are sitting there reading through pages of reviews on the latest devices that have so far been released in 2021 STOP NOW. You don't need to look no further than this device Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. It is the ultimate of all devices. From the smoothest screen I've ever come across to an amazing battery to high quality photographs you will not be disappointed. This is honestly the highest quality mobile device on sale today. It cannot be beaten in my opinion. There is very limited stock but if your able to get one of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G Leather Cases this will keep your device looking pristine for many years. Well done Samsung.",
            "The phone and its features are great! i fully support not providing a charger, but many people my have upgraded from an older phone such as the Galaxy S9 like myself would have found it better to have a usb - usb-c cable instead, or have an adaptor provided for the usb c cable provided, to be able to connect to a usb charger? And also maybe an adaptor to fit a 3/4 jack headphones to the usb-c adaptor too? The lack of these brought the value down a bit for me im afraid...",
            "I try the new samsung phones every year because I'm an iPhone user and have been since 2010, I always think I'm going to try and move away from apple but I never do because there is always something that isn't right with the samsung, this year the battery life is absolutely dreadful, the phone for some reason makes a strange noise like something is loose and the speaker quality is just nothing like an iPhone, I'm also still not a fan of android, I don't know what it is but iOS is still much more stable and polished compared to this, sorry samsung for the 3rd year in a row, its a no from me and I will be returning.",
            "Only had my s20 ultra for a few days one word wow brilliant camera very fast and responsive.  Would definitely recommend.",
            "I must say the speed of this device is something else its so fast. The cameras are unreal the definition and the fun you can have with it is mind blowing. I can't even moan about the battery life it last all day and I have it in high performance mode . All round bad boy phone for anyone interested in this phone its a no brainer, its a must.",
            "Just love samsumg but this phone is far the best one yet. Love, love love it you won't be disappointed",
            "I was extremely excited to get this phone as an upgrade from the S10 - once received, I realized the screen resolution was a downgrade from the S10, the 5G was slow (using same carrier), NFC payments worked in only 1 location whereas the S10 all locations I shop. The on screen fingerprint reader is placed to high, etc. I have since returned this phone and went back to my S10.",
            "Never have I been disappointed in an S model phone and that streak doesn't end here. From excellent battery life while maintaining cutting edge performance and fast charging, all alongside an unbelievable set of cameras. The software is the most seamless, almost pixel like, experience I've had with Samsung phones. One UI is clearly working. Only not 5 starts because I belive other phones can accomplish similar feats. Best Samsung phone hands-down. But not leagues above other competitors and I doubt a phone ever will be.",
            "I got the s21 ultra it is such an amazing phone can't fault it I left home at 6 o'clock used my phone lots got home at 5 still 50percent. Thats taking photo what's app social media and you tube and Netflix and other video services. Screen is amazing and the speakers are clear and loud. when got spare money will get the case and stylus. Games run smoothly. Only thing that bugged me is no charging brick I get why but I don't have a Samsung fast charger. So now got spend money get the 45w charger but otherwise it amazingly",
            "The design is amazing, the black color is great. The battery is clearly better. The fact that it is a bit thicker does not bother me at all. The camera is a work of art.  I bought a black case for it. The phone and the case are top-shelf gadgets.  Bravo Samsung!",
            "Initially I had some issues, but first update fixed it. So much better than my S20 ultra. \nOverall happy. All day battery and smooth experience",
            "Very easy to use and great size edge to edge screen as well love it",
            "After using the Galaxy Note phones for many years I decided it was time for a change, was due an upgrade and the battery on my note 10+ was starting to show some signs of old age.\n\nHave to say I am not disappointed with my decision...the phone is amazing, so fast and smooth navigating between apps, the camera is absolutely fantastic and with 256gb of built in storage the removal of the SD card didn't bother me at all. Using my previous charger from my note so again, the lack of a charging block is no real issue...well done Samsung overall an amazing phone so far...looking forward to using my case with S pen when it arrives",
            "Everything is good about the s21 ultra, it packs a mean punch, fast and reliable, photos are amazing. Only downside is no headfones and no jack for normal head phones",
            "I'm samsung user since forever, few months ago got my s20ultra, won't lie it was great phone but wasn't the best, had its ups and downs, when i saw the phantom color on the event evening i ordered s21 ultra straight away. The phone is everything i ever wanted, from colour to picture quality, sound quality, graphics.... i can keep going forever.. only samsung users will appreciate everything the tech team have done to get to this point. And those who doesn't have it yet, get it today and enjoy extraordinary experience.. this is not piece of tech that comes everyday across.",
            "First new phone I've had in a long while upgraded from a Sony Xperia and wow, very smooth running screen quality is amazing,  just getting used to the camera and taking the perfect photos, I purchased the case with the pen, which I would highly recommend the pen works extremely well, over all very impressed, only thing I can complain about is not being able to use a SD card that is the only disappointing feature but I guess everything else makes up for it",
            "I have upgraded from s10+ and I haven't regret a single second since I got the s21 ultra! \nIt runs very smoothly, amazing speeds, mind blowing camera. Specially the night mode! Samsung went the extra mile there! \n\nHaving said that though, I got the phone today so haven't tried it much.\n\nBut I am 100% sure Samsung will not dissapoint!",
            "I upgraded from my S10 Plus to get this as I knew it was coming and I absolutely love it the  phone is beautiful the camera is amazing it's soft and love everything about it",
            "So I thought the s20 ultra was a disappointment. The s21 is so much better and is what the s20 should have been. Amazing screen and camera. Loses a mark for removing the sd card",
            "I upgraded from Galaxy S10 and I'm VERY impressed. The overall performance of the phone is super smooth and the camera quality speaks for itself. Fantastic phone.",
            "Had no issues with other heating like others have said, battery life lives upto what I expected(charge once every other day) beautiful display, 5g is awesome",
            "OK so I've always had samsung phones from day 1 upgrading every 2 years. \nThis time I've gone for the s21 ultra and boy I'm not disappointed. \n1st of all no memory slot which I didn't know but this phone has literally transferred my memory card stuff into the phone...so no worries there.\nAlso the switch app ..amazing so simple and easy to use my phone was transferred within 30 mins , just the finer details of setting up my bank accounts etc  ,again no issues brilliant \nHuge screen compared to my s10  , I've never been a big tv or movie watcher on my phones but with this one , I think I'll be watching a lot more \nSo much to say about the s21 but I think I'd not have enough space ....so....\nLoving it just need to splash out on a case and screen protector",
            "Once again a great phone, having upgraded from an S20 I didn't get the wow factor this time round. (S9 to S20 was massive)\nI was disappointed to find there is no longer a place for a memory card.\nI also purchased a Samsung case with pen but I think there is a slight design flaw as using the volume key does not always work.",
            "So this my 5th Samsung Galaxy S series from (first being the s3). The new s21 ultra is a ridiculously good phone, super responsive, ultra fast (no pun intendes) and the screen is truly amazing. As I said this is my 5th Galaxy s series phone and I can't stop using it and raving about, battery life is amazing considering my use.",
            "Love my new phone loving the purple and the rose gold",
            "I upgraded from the note 10 as the s21 ultra works with the s pen. Was very disappointed to learn the phone didn't actually come with the s pen. You think for the price of the phone, Samsung would put a plug and s pen in the box.\nOn a positive note, the proccesing speed and camera are remarkable. My friend got himself an apple 12 and this S21 ultra blows it out of the water. The gaming experience is much better than the apple.",
            "The S21 ultra matched with the robust silicone case gives you that premium feel. With a pre installed screen protector, I see this phone lasting me a good few years. Capable of anything you can think of and more. Very fast and a brilliant display. No complaints from me",
            "I have S21 Ultra and I'm more than impressed. This time Samsung nailed it. Camera performance is unbelievable! But I found one thing that really bothers me and I pray to god that they are going to fix it. Whenever the zoom cameras (both 3x and 10x) detect dark color or something like that it switches to a very bad quality and I have no idea why... And it's not only in low light situations. Happens all the time and it's really bad.There also one more thing I've noticed. When this happens and I go more than 15x zoom it changes to sharp image again. That's a big bummer for such a great phone. Please guys do something about it!!! Other than that the phone is amazing in every aspect!",
            "Smooth scrolling and amazing camera along with great overall enhancements.",
            "Phone is fantastic  great battery  life screen is amazing  and the camera  is on another  level.\nI took this phone of the moon a few days ago",
            "Coming from the S9, I am really impressed with the S series developments to date.\n120hz super bright screen. \nAmazing all day and then some battery. \nBest phone I've ever had.\nSo responsive and super smooth with stunning cameras.\nCan't believe I'm alright spending this amount on a phone and happy about it.\nThat should speak volumes about the quality provided.\nThats not to say it's not too high though because it is.\nBut I just can't seem to put it down now it's in my hands and with the frequent OTA updates things will most undoubtedly improve.",
            "The plastic back Is the main let down of this phone, I have to ask why Samsung would you do this? The S10 feels better to hold for this reason alone. But if we can ignore the plastic back it is a fair upgrade from the S10, it's quicker overall. If it had the glass ba k I'd have gave it 5 stars",
            "The phone is a remarkable piece of innovation by Samsung. The screen size is huge with ultra HD resolution letting you enjoy the vivid colours. All processing is at a ultrafast speed with the new processor. Thanks to AI and one ui integration to allow user to do so much more.\nFor social media lovers and photogenic people it is a gem with a combination of rear cameras allowing you to capture every detail.\nDefinitely recommend!",
            "Been with Samsung a while now. Upgraded to S21 and the speed of this phone is second to none. Camera is good quality and it feels good in your hand, couldn't fault it! Only issue is no expandable memory...",
            "Ive been using an iPhone for some time as samsung never used to compare in terms of battery life until the S21 Ultra. Absolutely love the screen quality, battery life and power in the phone. The samsung S21 has brought me back to samsung to the point, ive ordered the Fold2 5G as a work phone.",
            "S21 ultra is fantastic fast sleek camera is ace and best phone I have had since the s10+ no problems great battery life",
            "Love my new s21ultra, battery last all.day and some , which is about 30% better than my old s20.\n\nCamera is fab,  and everything is smooth as silk. \n\nwish it had come with a charger and an s pen rather than buds, but",
            "Anyone having any trouble with the battery life, drains quiet quick\nThis is my first Samsung phone, and no charger,",
            "I got the S21 Ultra as an upgrade from a P30 Pro and the sharpness of the screen shines through, even at the comparable  FHD+ quality.  Have been experimenting  with the cameras and enjoying the various modes. Overall it is so fast and smooth, and I can't wait to enjoying the full potential  of this fantastic  phone.",
            "Much smoother and faster than my S10. Camera is incredible and even comes with a little screen protector already on, albeit it's only plastic film. Definitely a nice touch.",
            "Coming from a note 8, this does nearly everything that did, but better. The problem is the nearly. The first time I picked up my note, I was wowed by the size of it and the s pen. It was a revolution. The S21 ultra does a wonderful job - its fast, the camera is amazing, it looks great. But I find myself focusing on the negatives. \n\nThe SOT isn't as good as I'd have hoped (5.5 hrs or so). Hopefully this will improve as I use it. I miss the S-pen. I will buy the Bluetooth enabled one when it's released - but for now I miss it. I miss the kickstand I had on the Note - I'll fix that myself by getting another case - but mostly I'm just missing the wow factor.\n\nThe camera comes close to giving it that push to 5 - but for now I'm going with 4 stars.",
            "So far after having it for one day id say its a good phone good concept I have the 512gb 16gb ram ultra. I am a uber driver so run variouse playforms on the phone aswell as wifi hotspot for my second phone a note 10 plus 5g. Which runs 2 other driving platform. I turn the phone to maximum perfeormance  and yesterday it began to over heat so much had to put ut near cars ac to cool it down only way to cool it was to turn iff majority of high performance features. And restart the phone several times. Not ideal when your work is on the phone and it is your main phone the note 10 plus i have never had this issue and i have the same running pattern",
            "It should have been difficult to improve on the S20 Ultra but Samsung have done it! \nThe S21 Ultra feels more premium, the slightly smaller screen is the perfect size and the weight and ergonomics are perfectly balanced.\nThe CPU performance is faultless! It keeps up with the most demanding games and activities without any issues.\nMaking the rear camera lens surrounds a satin finish was  brilliant idea! Much less chance of scratches and recessed lenses are well protected. The cameras themselves produce amazing quality photographs and night time photos vastly improved over the S20 Ultra.\nThe fingerprint scanner works first time every time, the sound quality is fantastic and even the \"click\" of the volume and power button is spot on.\nLiterally cannot find a single fault with the device, best upgrade I've had to date.",
            "Improved on all areas from last year's September ultra. Battery, camera and screen seem to be much better. Great job",
            "The handset feels extremely comfortable in your hand. The camera is absolutely immense.  The screen is amazing and the speed of the device is brilliant. Able to use the S Pen that comes with the S6 Lite Tablet which responds perfectly. Easily the best device I have ever owned.",
            "Coming from a S10 , You need a bit of time to adjust to the size difference, But everything just works better on the new S21 ultra  And more benefits",
            "I was very excited  about the new phone but when I received  the phone.  I realised   I was better of with my s10 +. as I was using the audio jack and memory card as well with my phone  memory.  on top of it .when apple stopped the charger with there phones Samsung make fun of it. but now they did the same thing... and telling people a same story of apple.. for environmental  reasons.. which is a complete lie . they are just saving money..",
            "Loving my new s21 ultra but does get very warm very quick excellent camera",
            "Im loving the phone so far , seems alot smoother to operate than my previous s20. And feels better to hold, i found the previous glass backs a bit poor , been with Samsung since the s7 , all good phones",
            "I've upgraded to the s21 today and wow...\nIt's good man, like really good. \nThe camera is amazing!",
            "Big change from my s10 to s21 ultra. Quiet heavy n bulky compared to the old phone. But cannot complain as huge difference in everything from camera to speed and other superb features like s pen. Loving the device.",
            "I previously had S10+, which I wanted to upgrade and found this phone to be the one! It is heavier than the S10+ but the battery, screen, camera and battery are great! Love it!",
            "I've traded in my trusty S10+ and the difference is massive,,no contest,, this phone is worthy of a name ultra,,,in every possible way,, congrats Samsung to putting this together,,I don't mind the lack of a SD card slot but charger would be nice,,,but anyway, good job sammy",
            "Only had the phone a day. It's a little heavier and thicker than what I had previously but I'm not hating it. It runs so smoothly and everything feels effortless. The camera! And the 108MP camera! And the seemless switch to macro! Just waiting for a tripod so I can use the 100x Zoom to the best of it's abilities!",
            "I've had all the models with the exception of the S20 and that was purely because I was still very happy with the S10 plus. \nHowever, on seeing this new bad boy I was completely filled with excitement.\nThe design and feel of this Ultra in my hand is bliss. The screen brightness, the ease of using the phone itself is brilliant. \nSamsung...you've done it again!\nI'm also very keen to start up photography with this new baby too, as the cameras are superb. \nI also have an iPhone 10XR which I have to use for work but it comes nowhere near my new S21 ultra in phantom black.",
            "I upgraded my s20 ultra  to s21 ultra and so happy with the product. looks awesome camera is the best I've seen .battery life is very good indeed. and screen is amazing. all in all #best phone on the market without a doubt",
            "I picked up the S21 I pre-ordered yesterday.  All of my old music files are not playable on this phone.  I do not like the buttons all on the same side, it is awkward.  In general I upgraded to get a poor experience.  I have been a Galaxy S Series owner since the 4 and this will probably be the last one.  I will probably with to an IPhone after this.",
            "The best camera that Samsung has ever put into any of their smartphones. Beautiful design, great build quality and compatible with the SPen. It doesn't get any better than this King of Android phones.",
            "Samsung knocks it out of the park again. A fast, good looking masterpiece.",
            "Amazing phone, superb quality. \nCan't wait to get to know the phone better",
            "On Vodafone UK. It seems to be a common problem. Tried everything. The option to use it is missing from the phone app settings. We have two phones, S21 Ultra from Samsung and S21 Plus from Vodafone. Neither works. Our previous S20 phones worked fine.",
            "Had the s10+ and loved it, this is just the next level. Have it setup with my Nexdock for samsung dex and now I also have a upgraded laptop",

            "Bought as a replacement to my p30 Pro  only had it for a day and a bit but I'm impressed so far ..",
            "Wow what a phone feels more beefy than my s10+ but very powerful love the camera",
            "Brilliant phone graphics are amazing, very stylish.",
            "loving the camera. and I am writing this with the new S pen",
            "I've just upgraded from the S10+ to the S21 Ultra and alls i can say is this phone has amazed me at every point the design of the phone is beautiful and perfectly weighted for its size and im my use of it so far from normal use to apps and gaming  and most of all and amazing part of it the camera on it from 1x upto 100x each photo has been perfect i can't fault it. I can't wait to go on my next trip walking in the wild so i can snap so many beautiful photos. I can't recommend this phone enough and probably one of the most competitive prices to date for a flagship phone ♥️",
            "I switched from iPhone, from having an iPhone since the first one I had always tried to switch with going back within the 14day cool down. This time I've decided to try again and stick it out. After 24 hours I'm already use to the s21.\nOnly downside was because the cable for charging is usb-c on both sides I had to go and buy an adapter to change it to normal USB one side to use my USB plugs. Should come with an option to get a plug or not for people who have had different phones or older phones with a different connection. \nOver all great phone, easy to use and lightweight. Love the purple too",
            "So far the phone is exactly the same as s20 they fixed the camera and took away the micro sd slot so feels more like a downgrade than a upgrade so far i dont feel the camera is any different! Apart from obvious focus fix . The screen is better and i like the spen feature",
            "It takes stunning photos and videos and i love the natural bokeh at 10x zoom which is great for natural photography. Well done Samsung!",
            "Phone looks great, it feels it sgould ve powerful...but...  benchmarks of the phone a very poor, way worse than been expected from reviews.  Phone is heating up a lot, in some cases it's overheating. Just turning on camera makes it so hot its perfirmance drops so badly. Using 120 refresh rate will increase phone batery draining abd heat massively, that will reduce its pwrformance...so those fancy specs are just...",
            "Upgraded from n s10+ and the camera upgrade is insane. Feels great in ur hand, but is definitely a lil heavier. I just miss the memory card slot, and the way the rear camera lenses protrude from the back worries me a little for potential damage. Also disappointed that the charging cable that's provided is usb-c to usb-c trying to force you into buying a new adapter. When you spend over 1000 on a phone you shouldn't have to spend extra to charge it with the original cables. So I love the phone itself just think Samsung are missing out on the details and things like memory card slots is what helps make them better than iPhone.",
            "Crystal clear imagery. Super 8k video. Easy to use, worth the wait",
            "Words dont do justice ! But been a Galaxy S users since Galaxy S2 and have streak of using all of them. It never lets me down.  Thank you Samsung for a amazing phone.",
            "I just upgrade my Samsung a41 for s21 so far it OK. I am not worry about a charger come with it and you can change the setting for turning of the phone.",
            "Lots better than my previous phone the s10+. New user interface better and camera is unreal. Shame no port for micro sd but plenty of built in storage and 12gb RAM so happy days. Cant wait to get S pen and clear view cover to finish the look",
            "Received on the launch day! Been using a s9plus since that came out! What a difference this phone is the smoothness is insane. Well done Samsung.",
            "I can't believe I'm actually having to be negative about a Samsung product but I've been using it 2 days now and I'm going to have to send it back. All I done is Web browsing and the battery life is dreadful and the phone overheats. Absolutely gutted as I have always loved Samsung products.",
            "Great phone feels really nice to hold. Takes awesome photos makes the extra cameras bearable. the photos are stunning",
            "Galaxy s21 Ultra is the best phone in his class. Everything is almost perfect but... But it's way to expensive. For that price You can get a used car... There are a lot of phones on the market with similar spec and abilities for half of 3/4 this price. Samsung don't go in that way, don't change into Apple :(",
            "I have been using my new S21 Ultra for a few days now. I love everything about it except the weight. It is extremely heavy to the point it puts strain on your wrist when using it.. It feels like a brick in your hand which is impossible to hold with one hand. Unfortunately, I really like everything else about it but just because of this I will be having to return it back )-:",
            "S10 was better. No charger, Cable is different, Fingerprint recognition further up the screen, To turn the phone off you have to press volume key and power button so you will take quite a few screenshots in the process. Should have just stuck with an older version.",
            "Got the S21 a day early with all the preorder bonuses and I'm throughly impressed. The 120hz makes a massive difference, especially when playing games. The camera quality is great, the colours are rich and vibrant and it's quick enough to capture my fast moving 8 month old. I got the phantom pink version and it's gorgeous though the metal around the camera and side of the phone is a very pink hue bot the rose gold/bronze tone that it looks like in the promotional photos. Overall very happy.",
            "Coming from the S10+ I can't believe how much faster this phone is. 120hz refresh rate is fantastic, not tried the camera properly as yet but can't wait to try it out. Another great phone from samsung. Only downside is no headphone jack, but I hope not to miss this when I receive the buds pro.",
            "Exceptional  class leading and stylish. To be honest they describe the S20 ultra in a nutshell. The S20 line up is a powerhouse of a device that will leave certain fruit shaking leaving more than just a bite out of it. The bar has just been raised.",
            "Great phone feels really nice to hold. Takes awesome photos makes the extra cameras bearable. Some of the photos are stunning",
            "So I wanted to use the Samsung EPP together with the Samsung Upgrade Program but there is no option when you go to buy it. So it looks like unless it is fixed this week I will not be upgrading this year. Shame, as I like the look of the S21 Ultra 512 in navy. I would miss the lack of an SD card slot",
            "This device is almost like what a mobile should be. It has enormous specs and I would totally recommend it. The only I would change about this is an under display front cam. Other than that it's amazing..",
            "The multi colour scheme you have is amazing and new to see the specs of this phone are phenomenal and outclass the iPhone 12 Pro Max this phone is a must buy"
