            "I bought this a couple of months ago to replace my iPhone X and I’m glad I did as the camera is so much better! \n\nHowever, I don’t understand why this phone didn’t come with a charging plug and earphones like all the others did. The charger has a USB C cable so the only way you can use this is with a compatible plug meaning that you have to buy one from the Apple website if all of the plugs you own are from old models… they say it’s to reduce packaging but I think it creates more if you have to order the plug separately haha",

            "The phone is nice. I’ve always used an Android and wanted a change of scenery. It’s very nice, but I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily better than Android. The biggest benefit is the long lasting software support and security updates for 5+ years. I find it has more bugs than Android, but mostly when it comes to the UI. That being said, the UI is pretty slick. The 60Hz display is the biggest drawback. Androids are way smoother because of that. A bit overpriced too. Good camera.",

            "I bought this phone couple of weeks ago. It’s really worth it for the price. Camera quality is too good. Phone is really fast. I will reconvene this phone for iPhone users.",
            "All perfect! And as well perfect service from Argos",
            "Yes, finally took the plunge with the iPhone 12, so easy to transfer everything over from my iPhone 7.\nLove the added security of “face recognition”, and the convenience that it provides. \nMade sure this time that I had a reasonable amount of memory 128gb. \nThe cameras are brilliant on these latest iPhones. Even though I have some excellent cameras, you don’t always have them to hand. \nJust make sure that you have a good screen/phone protector for your investment.",
            "Very good phone. A good upgrade of my phone. Love it",
            "Upgraded from the 11, tiny bit smaller slightly faster not a massive difference but love it and I’m 5G ready! Oh and love the mint green colour!",
            "Great phone but I’m an apple fan anyway! Easy to use great contrast and screen quality, super quick to set up, not updated my phone in a while I had an 8Plus and didn’t realise they now use a different USB lead and don’t supply the plug! Good job my old ones fit! Great phone it’s a thumbs up from me",
            "Doesn't have a charger to plug, just a cable :(",
            "The colour and design of the product is excellent.",
            "Very up date technology to use iPhone 12 but still got to use the the phone without home button",
            "Perfect size for me. All the same as apple mobiles go. Quicker loading and fab camera.  Face ID is not ideal for the present situation with face masks so back to basics with pin passwords. That doesn’t bother me at the moment. I just love apple products so I’m very happy with my phone.",
            "I love my new phone\nVery nice and good gualiti comper if the price IV paid",
            "No charger and no headphones.",

            "Super;) Super Super;)",
            "iPhone 12 is the bang bang",
            "Nice phone not too big an not too small. I’m happy with it, as my last phone was the 6s so there’s a lot of difference.",
            "Upgraded my phone from a iPhone 6 which was ancient to the iPhone 12 so pleased a great camera and new features and better battery life compared to my old phone , glad I got this from  Argos as can spread the cost on my Argos card and I maintain my sim only usage and lower monthly bills .",
            "Overall this is a good iPhone, however it's not cheap and lacks an important feature in the current mask wearing climate. It only has face unlock (other than PIN,etc) and no fingerprint unlock. So it's not as easy to unlock when wearing a mask.",
            "The phone works great and looks amazing. Would totally recommend buying it.",
            "I love this phone. I would definitely recommend it to others",
            "Top of the 12 range for value and quality. Dont wast extra money onbthe pro and pro plus as only the camera is slightly better.",
            "My new phone is amazing, quick and easy. Only problem is the payments did take some time to go through on the Argos website and took quite long to sort out but in the end I paid with PayPal and it worked.",
            "Had to return this after a week suffered terrible headaches & eyestrain. After some searching on google the iPhone 12 has a Oled screen & flickers causing eye strain & there was lots of other users with the same issues. Going for the iPhone 11 as that’s an LCD screen.",
            "Very happy with my iphone12 and with Argos delivery service I would recommend this Iphone12 to all my friends.",
            "Loving my new iPhone",
            "I always buy my phones from Argos because they come unlocked to any network and your not in a contract with anyone. I can trade my phone at any time for a newer model.",

            "Good phone. Slick in design, easy to use as always with iPhones. Good new features and camera is awesome. Highly recommend it since it’s not much difference between 12 and 12 pro.",
            "Upgraded from a 7 plus, I hope this was lasts as long as my old one! Very fast, very sleek.",
            "I have just replaced my iPhone 7 Plus with this model. It is about the same size. Bought a case and screen saver straight away. A bit different from the iPhone 7 Plus but you soon find your way around, and there’s always “YouTube” if you get stuck on anything. Transfer from old to new phone was a lot easier as it now involves a   QR image and it’s just follow the instructions from there. Happy with the phone it’s just the price that initially put me off.",
