Opening basic webpages, tapping in commands to the operating system can be painfully slow.\n\nOn the upside it’s light and phone calls work… once you get the operating system to connect the call, which is particularly difficult and laggy if you were say surfing the web at the time of receiving  the call.",

            "This phone is completely useless. It was bought as a go between when I broke my note 9. The phone is just 3g but barely even gets the Internet. It takes around 30 seconds to open any apps even sending a text message takes around 30 seconds for it to open.\nThere is a long delay between the phone ringing and being able to actually answer it so you only get about 1 or 2 rings to answer quickly before you miss the call. \nAvoid at all costs and spend a bit more for a phone that will actually work.",

It doesn't ring but shows missed calls. If it does ring the answer button only appears when it wants. I have to wait for the call to end & ring back.\nMost of the time it just shows a white screen when you're trying to do anything on it. God forbid you'd need to make an emergency call. Might as well try and find a phone box.",

Some other phones have another option to use GPS (On, device only).",

Easy to use and ok size for smaller hands. I struggle with the touch pad as quite small tho. Easy to install parental controls and basic apps. Comes with 2 covers, screen cover and headphones. Good for the money for basic entry level phone.",

Delivery was very quick. It would be nice if Argos stocked and sold accessories such as a case or hard screen protector for the phone but you have to go online to source them if required. If you are looking for a fully featured compact phone this is an excellent buy.",

The phone feels well made and I've had no problems using it. Just to make me even more cheerful - it comes with two gel type back covers (in snazzy blue & bright red) & a screen protector. The phone isn't always the fastest but it always does what I ask of it. Battery life isn't the best - but hey, just use the neat charger supplied.",

            "Bought this as an international travel phone. It's an inexpensive \"smart\" phone which handles all the essential apps (WhatsApp, Insta etc) and if it gets lost or stolen, no big financial hit. Camera isn't high quality. The screen is not glass, so it takes a lot of rough handling and can't shatter. Battery doesn't last long.",

It is so bad that I couldn't even carry it around and had to confine its use to when I am in the hotel. And the phone was only used for WhatsApp messaging and extremely limited browsing. Keyboard is unusable.\nPerhaps this is what should be expected at this price, but surely there is a minimum standard of performance required of any mobile phone.",

A replacement was no better, discharging within a similar period.

This is the third one I have had so that should tell you that I like it but each new one has been because the battery has stopped working within about 12 months. However, that is a minor irritation coming from a phone that only costs about £30 from Argosl. My advice is to back up all essential information like contacts so you don't lose anything important when the battery gives up on you.",

I also use this phone to listen to podcasts.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend this as a main phone due to its compact size, but it totally serves the purpose I bought it for.

            "Bought for a 75 year old man with clumsy big fingers & no idea of technology.. It was very easy to set up & it is easy to use. The charging hole is a little stiff , so it requires a little more of a pull / push . So I’d say keep big clumsy fingers away from this part.. battery time is good , but it’s only being used  for calls . Great value & it comes with two silicon covers & screen protector. So far so good . X",

The screen is not easy to read outdoors in daylight. The instructions are simple to follow for the basic set up, but there is nothing to guide you on how to use the phone. My biggest complaint is that it has a very old version of bluetooth and won't connect to my laptop or the car even though neither are that new. For this reason I can't recommend it.",

Not a phone for moderate to heavy users and definitely not a phone for gaming or pictures and videos as the cameras are poor. I would only use this phone for a spare that's all.

The battery lasts for 2.5 hours of video and 3 hours of music (screen off), with bluetooth on and wifi off without being completely drained.

No hidden buttons or functions.\n\nBest of all, since it is an Android system , it has lots of free apps for installation. \n\nOh! And I particularly love how this phone is highly integrated with Google accounts. It just makes it so convenient! \n\nGreat buy! Definitely worth it!",
            "Nice phone.",
            "Found it very easy to set up and use. Camera of good quality",
            "Cheap but does what's listed on the box\nLightweight and handy but myself personally wouldn't like to have such phone, just bought it for a kid",
            "Alba have made a unique phone at a great price,easy to use and better than some expensive smart phones",
            "I only need a phone for basic use. This fits the bill. However a fully charged battery is only lasting a day if not used. If the phone is used then the charge drains very quickly.  Whenever I am near a socket it is plugged in.",
            "Bought for my husband, new to android and any phone that does more than ringing or texting. He loves it. Easy to use. Clear to view and use screen and apps. To be honest I'm impressed with the phone's capabilities and performance and at such a great price too. It's a perfectly good android phone with Nougat operating system without the overly excessive complexities and excessive apps of others yet offers the facility to add if required.",
            "A good basic phone. Two sims. Two free phone covers and a screen protector. Cant go wrong really.",
            "Bought this as a replacement for my sons broken phone.  I couldn't afford alot so went for this and to be honest, it's better than the phone he oringally had. Does everything he needs it to do, it reposonds quickly, camera isn't great but that's not really a problem. Does everything a smart phone should do.  Simple to set up, comes with 2 cases and a screen protector.  Will be purchasing this as a first smart phone for my mum ;)",
            "Good value for money. Dose what it's says. Bought as a temporary phone for my son. He was very happy with it.",
            "great value for money, easy to set up. only thing to remember this phone uses micro sims",
            "I bought this for my son as his contract phone broke and he needed a stand in one until the end of his contract, Very light weight.. Good that it comes with two phone covers. Gets all apps he uses - Generally a good little light weight phone",
            "A cheap android phone with all the features that any smart phone can give. Great value for money.",
            "Decent little smart phone for the money. Has all the features and apps needed....good as a starter.",
            "This is a good, reliable and cheap smartphone. Only draw back is 8gb memory but As long as you know that it is fine. not a Samsung or iPhone, but does a good job for the money. Recommended",
            "The product was worth the price Good...",
            "phone is just right for me perfect size",
            "Wery wery gut",
            "Painfully slow on start-up. It took me quite a few times of pressing the phone icon before I could actually make a call. I returned to the store to ask for a refund because, in my opinion, the phone was faulty. The assistant refused a refund because she said the phone was ok.",
            "All basic Android features, smart phone. Great value.",
            "A nice gift, which my aunt appreciates!",
            "Bought solely as a phone for basics and texting for 2nd line. My main phone is high end and very capable so I may be comparing chalk with cheese.\n\nThis is unbearably slow. Keeps failing to answer calls when I accidentally touch side button. I wasn't expecting much for the price but I'd say it is below my already low expectations. Fuzzy display. TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE despite only using for occasional brief calls and none of the smart features. I would not recommend this phone.",
            "Its a fair price!  Obviously there are phones out there with more features but if its just a bog standard smart phone you're after then you cant go wrong with this",
            "A nice practical size for shirt pocket (4\" screen)",
            "A great phone that does everything it Say's. I like that you can put two memory cards in and keep things separate. Really good back/front camera takes nice pic's. Battery lasts me one day when I use it a lot for eBay etc otherwise longer.",
            "i would recoment it to freinds and family no donts about it",
            "battery wants charging constantly alters settings while your talking on phone speaker phone is all norman collier and cant hear anything not impressed. the only good thing is argos always good service.",
            "Great phone, does all its supposed to without costing too much.",
            "Excellent, no problems. Going to purchase one for my son soon.",
            "too slow. in rest is ok",
            "say to use , good value for money and sim free what more could you want",
            "Finally gave in and decided to buy a smartphone but didn't want to spend big money in case it wasn't for me. The Alba 4 is an android phone and as I have a Google Chromebook, I was pleased to see that logging onto my Google account on the phone synced my emails, diary and photos.\nThe only issue is battery life, but my son suggested settings to prolong this and now I just about get a day out of it.",
            "I was skeptical but reading reviews thought for the price I'd give it a whirl. I'm glad I did. Although the camera is not brilliant all other features are cracking. Some of which were not on my more other phone. Well worth the money highly recommend buying this smart phone as its easy and simple to use but with all the benefits of a more expensive version. You even get 2 free phone cases which is brilliant (for the accident prone like me) 10/10 Argos",
            "This is my first Android phone as I am a bit of a technophobe, but I have adjusted very quickly and find all the extra features and the range of Apps very useful. Would recommend as an entry level phone at a good price. Battery life is the only drawback, would be nice if it lasted a bit longer.",
            "Very pleased with phone does everything and has sufficient memory to download apps.\nSmall screen but manageable",
            "Great little phone does everyone you want a phone to do, comes with a red and blue cover, great value for money.",
            "Mobile is small but mighty it dose all I wanted it to and more  good for money",
            "Great little phone very pleased with it wasn't what I was expecting for the price but it's great",
            "Lovely phone can't fault it",
            "Nothing wrong with it just a great phone",
            "GREAT MOBILE PHONE & FANTASTIC VALUE",
            "Easy to handle and write. Smart design. Big capacity of memory if you buy the Sd card. We bought 7 more, one for each one of our nephews.",
            "just the job for 9 year old grandson",
            "It's ok, for the money I suppose, expected better. It would be OK for someone not used to a mobile with apps. Using it with a cheapish SIM card for use on holiday. Battery lasts two days, just about on standby. Argos technical said there was a choice of ringtones, just one as far as I can find. Misinformed I would say. Had mobiles since year dot so I'm no novice.",
            "Bought for my young daughter and it is good for what she wantsaid it for.",
            "I bought this as a spare in case my smartphone gets lost or damaged. For the  price it's quite a good purchase, although the battery runs down really quickly. It didn't have some of the usual features such as withholding the number, so had to download apps for this. It also doesn't have options for personalising the background in messages, which I am used to in other phones and the time & date display is minuscule and can't be altered. On the whole I'm happy with it as it's only a backup mobile.",
            "Great value for your money.the phone is very stylish. With a long battery life. And a camera that takes lovely photos.well worth the money, Best Buy.",
            "The phone itself is quite nice but there is just one little thing wrong and that's the text message side of things from people you don't always get them but other than that its good for the price also its  little smaller than I thought but all-round its a great little phone",
            "Review is about the Alba 4 2017. I had the previous incarnation, and when it died with a cracked screen, I had the look of a relative who had been left £250,000... A little bit sorry but oh so relieved... It was ridiculously and embarrassingly slow... This phone is an entirely different animal. Highly responsive, has a decent, expandable memory, doesn't crumble under moderate demand, and is a joy to use. If you're not planning on taking over the world, this should be fine.\nRecommended.",
            "It is what was promised and seems good, altough it's early days yet.  I'm a bit worried that the battery may no hold up for a full day.  It was a new product, so no reviews to go by.  Good  value,",
            "When I considered this mobile I thought Alba really.\nAs it turns out it's better than the Sony it replaced.\nThis mobile should be up with the big boys.",
            "The best phone I have ever had",
            "Lovely little smart phone . Good value for money",
            "Great phone for the price. Does most things that more expensive phones do.\n\nOnly two minor issues:\n\n1. The earphones included are shockingly bad sound quality. Went straight in the bin. \n\n2. In-call volume is way too high for using earphones, even at lowest volume. \n\nOther than the volume problem, this is a great phone. Definitely recommend.",
            "this phone is the best I ever had it dose more then I was exspecting  great to use my grandson wants me to buy him one for his birthday glad I bought this fantastic",
            "A very good phone for the price. It is reasonably fast and has up-to-date Android. A few apps on Google Play are incompatible with the device (e.g. Tinder) and the limited memory means that apps will not run reliably in the background for notifications. The clock app (and therefore the alarm clock) also quits randomly. For the price, it exceeded my expectations."
