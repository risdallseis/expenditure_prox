            "I bought this for my 78-year-old mum and she loves it, the features that come with it are much beyond what I expected, battery life is that of a nuclear submarine! I will be buying one for myself later this year. Cant say enough good things about it at the price",
            "This a product good !",
            "Excellent & very easy to use",

            "This product is a low cost smartphone obviously, but it doesn't even process simple tasks.\n\nMy device just didn't charge battery and kept shuffling on/off charging sign with vibration.\n\nHad a bad experience with this product. Maybe wasn't lucky enough and got a broken one.\n\nLuckily returned it and got myself a other smartphone",
            "Pros :- Well designed, easy to set up, easy to use\n\nCons :- None\n\nConclusion :- Great phone at a great price. Bought for a daughters birthday, she is very happy with it.",
            "This is a terrible phone. It is very slooooow to react to button pushes and you have to wait too long to see if the phone will react to a selection. The screen goes blank whilst you are on a call and has to be awoken just to hang up. When answering a call you have to wait at least 3 rings to open the screen and answer the call. I wish I’d never bought it.",
            "Good phone. Pleased with it.",
            "Well worth the money.easy to set up.\nCant buy better than ARGOS.",
            "Excellent does what you need to do good value for money",

            "Very simple and easy to set up and use",
            "Bought this phone as a stop gap, however the performance speed is really bad in comparison to others I’ve had. There is alway a time lag, sometimes quite short, other times quite long. There were occasions when I was trying to open apps and it would up the wrong ones repeatedly. Not really sure why they are even allowing this phone to be sold, it’s so bad. Mine is going back to Argos.",
            "Have had a Nokia once before,so this one was under par, only purchased it because of the removable battery.Least favourable phone ever.Way over priced, unusable, unresponsive,slow,the set up is complex,will only download updates via WiFi.What happened to a straight forward phones of latter yrs.",

            "Worked fine out of the box and seems to be a very good phone. The only issue we have had is that on the first charge, it would not switch back on. A quick web search revealed a soft reset option, no doubt already known to non-technophobe owners. This sorted the problem, but it has reminded us that my wife needs to charge it before it gets very low.",

            "I really doLove it ,it have a long battery life and it’s so reliable",
            "For the price this phone is good. However, it is slow if you try and do more than one thing at once. Bought for my father who uses it to call and text and take the occasional photo, so it's absolutely fine. Would recommend for a similar user, not for a younger person who will want to browse the web, play games or go on social media.",

            "Bought for 11 year old son who is tech savvy, we didnt want him to have a phone he could get addicted to so we went for a very average phone with average download speeds and this is exactly that. Seems very reliable and very good at what it does, but its just not quite responsive enough for gaming so it suits our needs perfectly.",
            "I bought this phone on short notice as i needed a smart phone to replace a damaged one.\nFor a smart phone - its poor. Loading times for anything are shocking - including basic phone functions such as calls and SMS. It is so poor in fact that when the phone rings, it will invariably cut off before you get the chance to swipe the screen to answer. This is purely as a result of screen response time to the phones workings. \ni've given it two starts - because it does work - but would not recommend.",
            "Battery life is so good on this easy to use.",
            "Great phone drove it as it's easy to use and handle",

            "When I first opened be box I thought wow this is a great phone for the price.\nOnce I set it up it wasn't suitable for the amount of apps I use it started lagging a lot and I could barely use it.\nThe Screen is great quality and you get what you pay for.\nIdeal phone for a basic user but not suitable for an intermediate or advanced user.",
            "Brilliant little phone for the money, does everything you would expect from a phone in this price range.",

Argos really saved me,and looked after my Mum's best interests too!",
            "dont buy this phone if you want a phone to use",

            "Decent mobile with a nice screen. \n\nTaking the back off to put in the battery and sim was awkward but not something I'll need to do often. \n\nSetup was 90% easy and 10% frustrating.",

            "Basic smart phone does everything ok",
            "Just bought new phone 2 weeks today, tried to contact argos last week by email telling them that it only worked for 3 days, very slow to switch on and power up, battery fully charged and keeps switching itself off, Had to switch it back on everytime I wanted to use it and missed dozens of calls, it switched itself off again last Thursday and wont come back on, email Argos wanting to return it for refund, no reply",

I have had to restart  the device on numerous occasions since purchase because  it has been crashing . Makes me wonder what kind of operating system the device has . Camera resolution is awful and video playback in apps such as WhatsApp or Messenger is always lagging.",
            "Bought this for my wife when her phone died. It’s a great example of a smart phone for a cheap price, lightweight, responsive, and just does all the basics you need it to do",
            "Dont buy this it's too slow.",
            "Bought this fir my daughter as her first touch screen(who has been using my iPhone for games ). Was expecting slow network for the price ... but in addition to that the touch screen Is very slow—- probably 10 generation primitive than any other modern phones .., display basic for the price ... should have paid £50 mire to get basic Samsung",
            "Very good. I recommend it. But very difficult to open the phone",
            "I love it its not a bad phone",
            "First i find it very difficult to open, i needed to ask a friends help to open the back cover to put battery and sim card on, and even with my friends help he also struggled, then its quite slow to operate, guess im used to other phone but i find this slow, aside from that i guess with the price its a good phone to send message and call without looking too outdated.",
            "I bought this for an elderly neighbour hoping that it would be easy to use...and indeed it is.\nBut it simply did not work!\nOn most apps the keyboard would not open so it made them impossible to use",

            "Got the phone as my old one broke, put the SIM card in, there are 2 SIM card slots, I tried both slots and it randomly kept losing signal.  The phone also kept getting very hot and battery lost its charge very quickly.   I returned this to the store and purchased a different phone a Motorola E6 which is much better.  I had no issues returning to the store, very impressed with Argos, I shop there all the time and will continue to shop there, just not impressed with the phone.",
            "Really simple to use, stylish design and large screen really like the Nokia phones.",

            "After a few days, an update seemed to complete satisfactorily but I later I saw that the update had failed. Eventually, my daughter, who is more au fait with the technology, did a reset but the phone still failed to complete the update. \n\nI can give more details if required but, in the meantime, I will be seeking a refund in the next few days. Before I can do so, I have to try to extract my SIM card from the phone - no mean feat.",
            "Brought to upgrade husbands old brick phone very nice but very hard to teach an old brick user how to use as not many instructions had to use online manual for him to read as wasn't listening to me trying to help him do things on it after reading the online manual instructions he can now make calls answer calls write texts and reply to texts and in a while I will help him with other things as giving him too much info in one go was confusing and now complains that his fingers are to big lol",

            "Good size phone, purchased as a Christmas gift for my father. When first started to set up the phone could not get into the back of the phone to put the battery and sim card in, was very stressful. 45mins later after wedging it badly with tools I managed to get it opened, left phone scratched but still okay for use. Easy to set up once the battery and sim got in. Wouldn't buy this phone again, so not worth the stress.",

            "Entry level smartphone. Does what android does, albeit not as swiftly as a higher spec one. Takes a memory card, which is good. Takes a second sim which is unusual for low spec. This is great for low use or if you have broken your best phone.",

But for my dad it is fine as he only use the phone for calls and occasionally WhatsApp",

            "Great phone , not to difficult to work and feels light.",
            "Does all the basics but can be very slow and the battery is unlikely to last more than a day of moderate use. Google assistant can become irritating as it cannot be fully turned off and has its own easily knocked button on the left side of the phone. Camera is good quality. Ok as a cheaper smartphone but would not recommend.",
            "I am very disappointed with the phone it is too slow to process and has to ring at least four times before the person ringing is displayed and can be answered.",
            "It’s brilliant product",

Phone would not store my screen brightness, volume and some other settings - had to re-set them several times a day.

            "All the phone I ever needed",
            "Very reasonable price for a smart phone",
            "A good little phone if you are already savvy on how to operate a smartphone, but no so good for those that are new to this technology.  Don't like that the screen goes to 'sleep' almost immediately, even when on a call on the only way to bring it 'back to life' is by pressing the on/off button.  Bought as a gift and only changed from an old keypad phone as service provider sent a new sim card that wasn't compatible with the phone he had.  An okay phone if you want  something cheap and cheerful.",

            "Bought this mobile for my mum who is in her 70s and she can use it perfectly well. She said the phone reception is a vast improvement on her previous phone and she uses WhatsApp a lot. She found this phone easy to use and perfect for her.",
            "I couldn't use it because the battery comes seperately and it was impossible to remove the back to put it or a sim card in. I even watched an online video on how to do it but to no avail. I returned it and bought a different make. The girls on the counter when I returned it couldn't get the back off either, even while watching the same online video. Comments on the video indicated that it's a common proble, one guy saying that he eventually used a bottle opener to do it.",

            "Very good I very like",
            "I had no problem getting the back off, about which many complained, it comes off easily with the aid of a thin bladed pocket knife! What I have found bad is the lack of any real instructions as to how to use the device. It seems that a huge amount of guesswork is involved in trying to use it as a means of communication, which is surely the primary function of a telephone! One has to guess that pressing a blue dot with spots gives access to the ability to dial a number. Could be much clearer .",

            "Looks good, easy to use, does what I need it for.",
            "This is an Android 'GO' edition phone or 'Lite' as referred to by some APPS. This means that some functions and APPS may not be available to download/install. 'GO' was developed for emerging markets in the world, so has a lower price point and technical hardware. It's OS is Android 10 and is ready for 11 (due soon). It's not for the user who is playing games/surfing/videos etc. every minute. If you intend to make calls/text, check your kids face book, bank/bus times occasionally then it's fine.",
            "Bought for an elderly relative with visual impairment because it has the Google assist button, all he has to do is press the button to wake the phone, swipe up to unlock, press the Google assist button and speak. With the contacts set up simply he can easily make calls using voice commands. Great for a cheap phone",

            "I bought this as a cheap emergency replacement so I wasn't expecting brilliant things but I did expect it to cover the basics. How wrong of me. The alarm will disappear for no apparent reason. I still haven't figured out how to answer WhatsApp calls and the browser crashes every two minutes - don't even think about trying to fill out a form or do some online shopping. The camera is nice but only takes pics some of the time. Don't waste your money.",
            "Bought this after a good newspaper review, as my 1st step into smart phones (low level needs). Neither myself or a friend or 2 Argos shop assistants (yes 4 of us) could get the dam thing open to charge up the battery- so i got a refund. How ridiculous & a massive design fault - especially knowing it's aimed at those less I.T sassy. Waste of your time & money.",

I don't want to know about Apps and stuff anymore than I want to know how the central processor on my Mac works. It is enough that I can use it for  the mainly basic communication and way-finding tasks that I need it for.",

I've damaged the top of the phone as it's so hard to get the back off, there is no ridge for you to get your fingernail in so had to use a blunt knife and it's very hard to prise off. Quite often have to press twice for the app to open and screen seems to dull then brighten for no reason. So looks score highly but using it at times is really irritating as so slow.",

            "The phone was advertised as network unlocked. Unfortunately EE said that the phone appears to be locked and they were not able to get it to connect to the network.\n\nI took the phone back to the Argos store the next day to seek a refund, the assistant told me that they have a red flag on this product and it shouldn't have been sold to me.\n\nThe customer service was great and I was refunded without question.\n\nHowever I am unsure why I was sold the product in the first place if it was flagged.",
            "This item was a bit disappointing the face unlock camera is madoka and doesn't always work its also slow and closes apps and takes some time too respond, on a plus note i did find the camera pretty good with clear photos but i cant recommend it as its too slow, it needs more ram and im not a fan of android go its limited and you dont get all the features of android which is a shame and a bit of a pain, I really recommend that you pay another £30 or so and get something with full android.",
            "Bought for my daughter and was worried as not quite the latest phone like all her friends have but she was over the moon with it as still stylish and has all the features she wanted",
            "Very good would buy it again",
            "Just brilliant phone for this price.\nBattery life is best of any phone I've had.",
            "Everything you need is on the phone. It's an easy to use phone.",
            "This Nokia is worth buying it works brilliant best decision I made worth the price",
            "I am very happy with the phone is it good make Nokia phone very good price",
            "Bought mainly for internet ,can be a bit slow at times but decent enough for the price.",
            "Good android and good price",
            "Nokia 1.3 \nIt’s ok and good price",
            "This is a really simple phone running a bare-bones version of android.\n\nI would only really recommend this for older people or people who want a no fuss cheap phone capible of running things like WhatsApp. \n\nIt can be laggy at times and I wouldn't expect to be able to play any serious games or anything\n\nSupports dual sim and micro sd expansion so great for those who need an international sim or similar.",
            "Decent value for money but the go version of Android 10 is kinda bad\nGets a bit buggy unlocking the phone",
            "Phone is ok, could do more for its money. No earphones disappointing. Overall it ok as a back up phone.",
            "Good quality phone , Exellent value",
            "Laggy overheated batt was very poor didn't notify me regarding messages took phone back for refund never again",
            "Really disappointed with the phone.",

            "Really happy bought for a present for my son was easy to show how to use and great battery life he was happy good buy",
            "Probably not the most powerful or full featured phone but a great price and the Android 9.00 is a big improvement\nEverything works as it should and the battery life is good \nBit weird shopping at Argos during Covid- but glad to see them up and running again",
            "Best basic smartphone on market. Working well so far just some issues in picking up the signal at times but very good indeed, considering the price. If you need to have only the essential functionalities of a smartphone and don't bother too much about pictures, video quality etc..this is the best deal.",
            "The problem is getting used to it at 69",
            "It does everything I want it to",
            "Absolute rubbish phone. Slow and useless. Avoud",
            "Price brilliant \nEasy to use \nHas WhatsApp \nAndroid \nGoogle",
            "Definitely very user-friendly for sworn techno-phobes. Smart looking and hardy. Will definitely be buying for my staff to use.",
            "Does what I need it to not a bad phone for the prices",
            "Good phone as a back up or first smart phone  does everything you need would recommend",
            "the price is good but the phone is not it is not worth it the phone hangs freezes if u receive a call it takes time to show you are getting call doesn't show any notifications so overall the phone is no good waiting for argos to reopen so i can return it.",
            "The good looks and slim modern case is worthy of a review easy to use once you get the knack of its new screen sliding methods it’s quick to change settings with Colourful pictures looking first class Worth every penny \nOne draw back was to open the case to insert a sim I found this really difficult but got there in the end 10/10",
            "Ordered this as an inexpensive emergency replacement for a broken phone, but I may just keep this. The specs aren't mind blowing but it uses Android Go, which is specifically designed for low end phones, and as such it's surprisingly fast given how little RAM this device has. It arrived same day, too, which was very much appreciated. Good little phone, and it doesn't weigh much either. All in all quite pleased with it.",
            "good phone to start using touch screen  phone",
            "As a budget phone, you shouldn't expect too much from this device.\nIf fully charged in the morn, the phone's battery will last until around 4pm until you have to charge again so be warned if you take on evenings out.\nThe apps are slow to load and often crash which makes tools like Google Maps and app banking very difficult.\nIf you use for too long, the device does overheat which in-turn, makes it even slower.\nI did return the device as it was such poor quality.",
            "you get what you pay for i use as emergency phone",
            "For the price this is a very good phone. Set up was easy and since I've been up and running (2 weeks now) I've had no problems at all.",
            "A nice android phone, works really well and easy to set up.",

            "Perfect for my 9 year old has all the stuff on it that's needed. Quite a good little camera",
            "All good value for money",
            "Bought this for my teenager when the last phone died. Not a great camera but the phone is good. Long battery life.",
            "We bought this phone for our 2 boys to keep in contact with their friends. It is not the fastest phone but generally works well. It couldn't run Zoom very well, the video was sticking badly, but worked absolutely fine with Skype video calls. I have installed Google Family Link to control the use of the phone, which works fine. We did struggle to get the back cover off. Overall, good value for money.",
            "LOOKS GREAT, WORKS GREAT (NOKIA KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING) BUT IT'S A SHAME YOU HAVE TO BEND THE BACK TO REMOVE IT (TO PUT BATTERY IN); WHY COULDN'T NOKIA STICK TO SLIP OFF BACKS LIKE THIER ORIGINAL MOBILES?  NICE THOUGH THAT YOU CAN GET TO BATTERY AS WITH SOME PHONES YOU CAN'T.  DON'T BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU LIKE ELABORATE APPS (OR LOTS OF APPS AND WIDGETS) AS ANDROID GO EDITION HAS SMALL MEMORY CAPACITY AND SOME APPS WON'T LOAD. HOME SCREEN IS LIMITED.  IDEALLY SUITED TO SCHOOL KID OR BASIC USER.",
            "Great price love the phone!",
            "Bought this for the colour alone. Do not have a contract that gives me mobile data and I don't connect to household WiFi in order to save battery life but able to send texts and use phone. Very pleased",

            "simple to use smart phone looks and feels far more expensive.if your not bothered about playing games and youtube etc then this phone is ideal.",
            "It is an easy and practical phone to use. The battery life is long and have essential features. \nMy friend who I offered the phone to is very happy so I am satisfied.",
            "Good entry level phone",
            "Brought this phone for my\n 80 years old dad. It is easy for him to use.",
            "I bought this item a month ago and use it as a secondary device. Dual SIM is useful to me,voice calls have a clear sound(which I need), baterry is strong enough to have calls for two days. I haven't used it for browsing,only for voice calls. Toughened screen is also a good option for money.\nIn general - worth money for budget and work phone.",
            "Basic smart phone but excellent quality. Battery life lasts 2.5 days with WiFi & Bluetooth on. Charges quite slow so do overnight. Loud ringtone, 2 sim & 1 SD slot. Some functions limited to allow for budget like cant like/dislike YT vids. Great for 2nd/work phone needing internet access/WhatsApp. Dropped it alot, never broke. Has most smart phone functions or capabilities. Pic quality great but vid recording can be jumpy during but ok after. Phone can be slow if battery low so keep charged",
            "This Nokia was bought as a first mobile phone for my daughter and has all the features that are needed.\nLovely sleek design, good value for money and happy child. Win win. \nI'd recommend.",
            "Bought this for my gran so that she can use video call to keep in touch with us, I set it up for her and I was really impressed with it. It really is amazing for the price, nice clear screen with good cameras and storage space for apps ect. Only slight nag with this was trying to get the cover off, it took over ten minutes, there's no grove to put your fingernail into. Apart from that it is the best budget phone for its price! Thank you Argos for another great product and fast collection!",
            "I would tell my mates to buy this phone easy to use",

            "Decent phone,easy to use",
            "Good phone recommend",
            "It works fine, good signal but sometimes freezes",
            "Great service from Argos, smooth and efficient as expected. The phone however, is awful. It does everything needed, but at glacial pace. Battery life is good, all the features are there in Android, but too sensitive on phone calls, so frequently puts calls on hold or mute, and answering calls is sporadic, again due to the terribly underpowered processor. Opening any app is a test of patience, I'm just glad I only use it as a work phone.",
            "Bought as a second backup phone and is excellent value for either a starter or backup. Good screen and storage.",
            "When I purchased the phone I thought it was great. The sleek design and and latest updates I thought if was the perfect phone for my budget. When I went to install two apps on the phone that's when I realised the phone was starting to slow down. It has now come to a point there the phone is that slow going from app to app and general browsing , it's become unusable",
            "This phone is extremely slow. It's taking ages to open an app, inbox or even contacts list. Calls are often getting disconnected after few minutes. Wouldn't buy it again",
            "I got the phone to keep in contact with my grandparents on their last legs to make sure they have alarms to take tablets and eat and drink, they find it so easy to use for the age they are it’s a miracle.",
            "Reach baseline of entry level phones.",
            "This phone is easy to use as I couldn't get to a phone shop as were all in lockdown. I needed a phone to be able to face time my husband as he has an old phone . I needed to see him as he is very poorly in intensive care and will be there for a long time. I found it very easy to use . Thanks to Argos for letting us get connected it means the world 2 our 3 children who can now speak and see there daddy .",
            "My Nokia 1.3 in Cyan, is a stylish competent phone with Android 10. It has the bonus of two years Android upgrades.",
            "Excellent phone for the price, looks more expensive",
            "the phone is nota described which was charcoal, it dosn't seem to have the features claimed , i havn,tseen anywhere to sign in with my eye print a advertised & it says very quick start but it takes twice as long as my old phone. delivery was superb.",
            "This phone was cheap but coming from a premium manufacturer I expected better. It's very slow to do simple tasks,load pages etc and I have excellent internet ,only bought it as a quick replacement until Argos opens back up and I can get my faulty Samsung replaced.i couldn't in good conscience recommend this phone to anybody, I reckon you could do much better for the money",

            "I will recommend it to anyone",
            "Excessive use of \"chrome plated googleitus\" for me.\n\nAlso they say to insert sim card, remove the back with your finger nail !\n\nWhat kind of nails do the think we have, I had to use a pen knife. Could they not provide a tool for this ?",
            "For the price, it's a decent phone for anyone wanting to have a burner/replacement/side phone, or one for someone who's using smartphones for the first time.\n\nI got this since my iPhone X battery died and it's not ideal to get it fixed right now but yes this phone is decent. It can be slow at times though.",
            "Fantastic phone for the price, has the usual smartphone features & current Android OS (10). Only downside is 1 GB RAM - sometimes this can hamper apps speed-wise, but other than that, if you only plan on doing a few things at a time, it's a fantastic phone.",

            "Bought this phone for my mum as she had hers stolen. However she had problems from the get go, and to top it all off the screen had been cracked around the camera lens. Obviously we didn’t know this until we opened the box. Waiting to return it to Argos ASAP. P.S I believe we was sold a returned item for full price.",
            "I purchased this for my daughter after she broke hers. She has found that on calls it disconnects. I put a memory card it but the phone won't allow her to save the photos to it. One disappointed girl. I went for Nokia as a well known brand but the phone has disappointed. I wish I was able to spend more on a different one.",

            "The phone was smaller than I thought it would be.+ The keyboard is too small.when using the phone after about 10 minutes of talking it cuts the call off.also during the call there is weird scretching noise.not happy with it at all I'm thinking I will have to return it.",
            "Good budget phone for price, very slow refresh, low quality camera and quiet speker. however for the price would be a good cheap starter phone or inbetween phone. battery lasts about 6 hours without blue tooth on.",
            "Great phone, easy to use, large screen size. Absolutely love it",
            "Great phone. Has all I need to do on it. I'm not good with phones as keep breaking them lol. But I won't purchase any other phone apart from Nokia",
