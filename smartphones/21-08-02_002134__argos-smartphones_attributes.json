            "Bought phone a week ago and it's been great. Battery life is great or charge time. Screen is LCD and 120hz so draining battery quick. Android 11 once updated. Nice coloros features. Big screen very smooth action and speed of flow with browsing and interaction within is. Good memory and storage size for the currency.",
            "It's not as good as I expected",
            "I am happy with my new phone",
            "Obviously haven't had the handset that long to know if it's going to last. Coming from a s7 edge which lasted over 4 years and didn't come problem free. Phone seems to be coping well, just had the Android 11 update and I'm happy with my oppo Reno z4",

            "Day 1.extremely happy with the device.smooth and fast. did have a weird boot menu when first turning the phone on. But hey can happen. \nDay 2. After playing a few games (games I used on a phone with 6gb of ram and same processor) started to notice the phone getting laggy\nDay 3. Phone was struggling with everything. Even recent call list was laggy\nPhone was returned and seems its normal for this make",

            "Good phone for playing games or working.",
            "This is the best cheapest phone I've ever used. The boxing is great. The box includes chargers USB c, earphones and FREE cover. The phone covers 5g coverage. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",
            "Was relatively painless - missed quite a few things on my Samsung, but I can live with it. Especially since some things were better\n\nJust reserve quite a few hours to organise/transfer files across and getting used to new features\n\nI also switched to giffgaff from EE. Again allow time for the handover. Much much cheaper and a few facilities missing. But happy to accept, seeing as it copes well with 5G",
            "This phone is great, it is sleek and looks really good. It also charges extremely quickly, so there is no waiting around for it to charge. It is really easy to navigate and the system allows for customisable settings so you can make the phone work in a way which suits you best. Couldn't recommend this enough. Already convinced 4 of my family members to get one.",

            "competitive price, looks great, worth it.",
