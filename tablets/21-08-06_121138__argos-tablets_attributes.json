Does not seem to be. It's not the quickest tablet that I have used-so very disappointed with it so far. Cannot believe reviews giving it 5 stars?.",

            "The picture quality and Dolby sound are exceptional, however its performance is erratic due to the Android System WebView, which is meant to guard against bugs, but its updates operate very much like bugs themselves, causing crashes of Gmail, Google search engine and other apps. Sometimes requires numerous logins within a few minutes of each other, even when I know from other devices that my broadband and internet are working fine. When it's working well, it's a highly satisfactory tablet.",

Battery life is stupendous, but I am not a gamer! Great for music, works well without using the bluetooth. Free standing, metal base is quite sharp, be careful where you put it. Might need some kind of pad underneath. 3Gb RAM is very fast for my needs. Very light to carry, but mostly I need both hands to operate the on/off + volume controls.",

I plug into my laptop to drag and drop files in so I can easily carry the tablet around, conduct my work and email reports from it. I'd recommend a case to protect it if you're using it at work.",
            "It's a splendid piece of technology. The sound is so real you don't need any other speakers to boost the sound. The drawback no USB slot",

            "This is a really great little tablet for the price – yes, you perhaps pay a little more for the form factor, but it packs a lot in. A few random things to note:\n- it has Lenovo's AnyPen technology, which means you can use any non-plastic object more than 1mm wide as a stylus, so you don't have to fork out lots of extra £££;\n- while the kickstand has four useful positions, it's worth noting that it doesn't work in a portrait orientation, despite some promo shots suggesting that it might",

            "Bought this as a Christmas present, so haven't tested it. Reason behind my choice was that the specs were similar with the market leaders and looked better, some of the specs were better and the price was better. Given the 2 years warranty, you can't fault is and maybe is tine to give a chance to Lenovo instead of Samsung or Apple. Preety sure will be perfect for the little one. Merry Christmas everyone!",

            "The tablet is a solid brick build. Very good speakers on that bad boy. The wee stand that flips on the back is very handy. U can even use it to hang it from a wall like a picture frame. The android allows you smoothly set up multiple users which is very convenient. Cons: could use more ram just to make it more responsive. I use it for my uni work and my daughter is smashing Roblox and it's working fine for both of us. I would recommend but wait for promo or slight price drop.",

This Lenovo has an\n excellent picture, is fast enough for my wife's needs and the sound us brilliant from the 2 larger than normal speakers. 3db ram and 32gb storage. A couple of weeks after I bought it, the price dropped by £20. It's an excellent deal.",

            "Very easy to use even if you are new to the internet",
            "I bought this 6 months ago and delayed reviewing it. I find the design quite clunky. Am also very disappointed because I chose this design based on its description of its multi-position ability but it easily topples over. Also there are some websites that default to Portrait position and it's not possible to position the tablet flat in order to look at the screen. It is also quite heavy for someone with wrist problems.",
            "Good design. Poor product as it gone dead in 2days of buying and had no way to charge or switch on. Came to know its a common issue when searched, the product had to be returned within a week.",
            "Bought to replace an ancient Lenovo tablet which was finally giving up the ghost. The picture quality and sound are very good. Performance is more than adequate for browsing, emails, Facebook, Candy Crush, etc. - all the usual stuff. The thicker bottom edge is an acquired taste which might make it awkward to put in a handbag etc. but ideal using around the house with the built in stand. Lenovo computer equipment has proven to be reliable in the past both at home and in work.",

            "I wanted a smart, fast tablet with good sound quality. This fits the bill nicely for the price.  It's a fast processor, good sound for streaming TV and films, as well as some  music. Security features such as Face Recognition are great, and already set up for Google Assistant. Slips easily into a bag, and the self contained stand is a real bonus..... ideal for use on a kitchen worktop.",

            "I can’t say nothing bad about this so",
            "This is a small powerful tab and the sound quality is amazing. The google assistant is also helpful but can be improved. One thing that can be improved is the stand which I think is small and it needs to cover the whole tab like in its precious model.",

            "Argos products are good",
            "Great all rounder, great sound and ideal for browsing and catching up on the latest films and music",

Otherwise after a few weeks use I am very satisfied.",

            "Great design and I love that the stand is built in really useful to hang in the kitchen to avoid spills & splashes. Not sure the battery life is as long as advertised though - playing games seems to use quite a bit. Overall, very good for the price though.",
            "The shape is very comfortable for reading while handheld and the flip out stand. Plenty of speed to run my news apps and the android versions of office. Combined with a compact bluetooth keyboard it makes a small and portable workstation.",

            "This was to replace a existing tablet- easy to set up up - seems to have good battery life and is quick and easy to use",
            "This is a bit different from your average tablet. It has two unique selling points - one is a flip-out stand. which is really handy for watching videos. The other is the fact that it has high quality stereo speakers, so you can use it as an internet radio, for example. There is actually a third point - it has the google assistant built in so you can say something like \"play gold radio\" and it goes straight to that station. Otherwise it's like any other android tablet with good build quality.",
            "Love the retractable stand. Easy to use. Does everything I need for browsing, email and has space for memory card.",
            "Bought this tablet for my son, to replace a really old one he's had for years. It was easy to set up, with clear instructions. My son is so pleased with his new Lenovo tablet - literally couldn't get him off it for days! It certainly feels very solid & stylish. The sound quality from the two speakers is very clear & loud. My son was enthusing today about how great the screen is. The tablet is a novel shape, with the bulbous spine, which he actually prefers. Overall, a definite 5 stars!",
            "Bought this tablet for my wife. Neither of us are techno people so I was a bit worried having to set it up myself because of the lockdown, but it was really straightforward. The design of the tablet is a big plus. The stand allows for various positions and the sound quality is excellent.",

            "Very pleased with the speed and clarity however the unusual shape makes it difficult to fit a case. On the plus side the speaker 'tube' with JBL and Dolby Atmos has brilliant sound quality.",
            "Very pleased with my new Yoga. Light, compact and fast, lovely colours.",
            "This is the second Yoga tablet I've owned - and this has replaced the first - which was excellent - and was purchased from Argos, around 6 years ago.

            "Slow and crashes regularly. Good speakers and screen and thats about it",
            "Well designed and excellent price. This was an android replacement for a very old iPad. It was very easy to set up and has a reasonable battery life.

            "Lenovo Yoga tablet work great and looks different than the other ones.",
            "A great tablet that is sadly being discontinued by Lenovo. It has a few features that help differentiate it from the endless identical slabs that most tablets are. \nIf you're in the market for a tablet and Argos still has stock, I would recommend picking one up. Once they're gone, they're gone!",
            "Excellent tablet with sleek design. I love the kick stand. Nice size. I really like Lenovo. The google assistant feature is quite sluggish but apart from that a good tablet",
            "Arrived quickly and is a good quality tablet. Had to upgrade to Android 9 and there is a little lag when trying to do some work and switching between apps but taking into account the price, this is still very good and better than some/most of the competition. Sound is very good and screen is good too. Enough space on the hard drive but may need expansion at some point in the future. More RAM would be good but as i said before, great for the price.",

            "Was looking for a new tablet and Lenovo has always been a popular brand for me.

            "I had an old Lenovo tablet and was happy with it, but as Lenovo were not upgrading the security in line with Google Android updates, (no update for 3 years) I decided to buy a tablet with a more up to date version of Android. This tablet is quick, reliable and does a great job for my needs. Battery life is reasonable and better than my old tablet. Sound quality is good. All in all, a nice tablet.",

            "Lovely little tablet that has inbuilt what others should have... A stand. We're using it for a Point Of Sale (POS) system and the stand makes it \"stand out\" from it's rivals. The first thing you buy when you get a tablet is a case / stand, well you only need a case for transporting this about, then you can take it out and enjoy it without the case, super tablet.",
            "Since getting the tablet, I've used it on a daily basis & find it simple to use & perfect for my requirements.\n\nIts portability means that you can use it anywhere. I had a bath last week & bingewatched a series & it had great colours, great connectivity & a long battery.\n\nIt has the beauty of having the stand or you can use the stand with a hook on the wall, so it can go anywhere with you.\n\nOverall a fab product, the only trouble is that my kids now want one!",
            "After 5 years my wife dropped her old Lenevo tablet once too many times and sad to say it died.\nWe decided that if the old Lenevo was good the new one must be better and we are not disappointed.Good memory,good Ram and unlike one of the big brands you can add memory via a micro sd card.All in all well recommended...and the best bit I'm in her good books!!!!",
            "design is truly amazing. It offers great stability whilst holding in your hand as well as multiple positioning on your desk and  can be hung. Was impressed with the sound quality from the  speaker system that offers multiple level of sound. I found the touchscreen to be extremely responsive. The picture quality is clear bright and much more than you would expect from a tablet screen. Stylish feel and colour",
            "Works great, long battery life as well",
            "If, like me, all you use your tablet for is emails, internet & streaming tv, you’ll struggle to do better & the price is great value.\nThe screen quality is amazing & sound is fantastic too. It is quick & responsive and not “buggy” or slow. It’s heavier than it looks but feels reassuringly well made, not flimsy/cheap. The ergonomic design takes a bit of getting used to but does make reading & browsing easier. The stand is a really neat feature too. For what I use it for, it’s as good as an iPad.",
            "Really great tablet, crystal clear display and amazing sound. The shape is a little hard to hold if you're holding the tablet in landscape, but the way you can hang it and stand it is great. Played games and watched videos and speed is great too. Fantastic tablet and has replaced my old one. Access to the Google Play Store makes adding apps and upgrades a breeze. Quickstart guide means you're up and running in no time. Highly recommend.",
            "This tablet has great packaging, gives a quality first impression from the off. The screen quality is very impressive and with the larger speakers pack a bit of a \"thump\" to the Dolby Atmos compatible sound system. The speakers double as a grab system too so you don't hold the screen and distract from viewing. I used it with a stylus and this should maybe be included as an accessory. The battery doesn't last that long but this could be changed with the settings being tweaked. Great product!",
            "This tablet is lightweight and so easy to set up and use. It has quite a few fantastic features, one of my favourites is the sound quality of its speakers, which are great for watching videos and listening to music, my daughters love that feature too! The other feature which is favourite for us is the fantastic little kickstand, it's perfect for watching videos hands free and for looking at recipes online without getting tablet mucky as it can be hung up using the stand too! The battery is great",
            "This is an extremely good quality, modern tablet with amazing speakers. It is very quick and responsive (4 users have been set up with no noticeable impact on speed). The display is clear and detailed (quality is great when streaming Netflix). It is very versatile to use given the different modes (see photos). The unique design with the speaker bar makes the tablet easy to hold when in portrait mode. I would recommend this tablet even before considering the benefits of Google assistant.",
            "Build quality is very good, a mix of plastic and aluminium. The stand is useful offers different positions can be hung up too. Screen has a thin bezel with crisp display, good colour saturation and the speakers are impressive making this a brilliant choice for media consumption (tv shows, movies) as well as email, ebooks, games, social media etc. Speaker bar is great to grip device with one hand. Fast setup by linking to phone took a few minutes. Built in Google Assistant and Expandable storage.",
            "Brilliant pad! Easy to use and set up especially if you already have a Google account. Very lightweight and great design. Display and sound are really good and the stand on the back makes it brilliant for streaming. Perfect for all uses from reading to game playing has a kids setting so all the family can use and comes with a good variety of pre installed apps/tools. Would highly recommend",
            "This tablet ticks all the boxes, and has been a big hit with my whole family, they are fighting over who gets it next! Easy to set up and operate, crisp graphics and rich colours when watching movies and playing your favourite games, and fantastic sound from the Dolby speakers make it a great all rounder. Links up to our existing smart devices and built in stand/hanging bracket means we can move it around the house and place it according to our needs. A great device, highly recommended!",
            "Great tablet sound quality is excellent \nGood design with built in stand\nScreen clear with good battery life \nAnd benefits from expandable storage \n5 stars \nAnd recommended",
            "Looks great, much lighter and better sound quality than the previous model, also battery seems to last longer. Like the kids mode with screen time limits and a range of apps to customise it, but this is really best for 6yr and under as interface a little babyish for my 8yr old boy.",
            "Excellent tablet ,looks very good,sound quality is surprisingly good for the size of the dual speakers.",
            "I love this. Loved opening the box it came in, looked rather top notch. I charged it which didn’t take long at all as already had a decent charge on it. \n\nThe bright and clear picture means it’s great for viewing films on. The sound is fantastic with a decent volume on it. \n\nLove that it can be hooked up, slanted, hand held or supported by itself. \n\nI think the only downside I have is that I now have to wrestle it off my youngest who has declared its. Definitely 10/10",
            "The Lenovo smart tab looks good in slate grey colour and looks different with the Dolby Atmos speakers built in at the bottom it has a good fold down sturdy stand as well as hanging ability so you can use it anywhere.\nGreat HD display and clear sharp graphics, has access to Google play store so you can download apps easily.\nThe Google assistant is very responsive and saves you having to type in search terms. Also has clear crisp sound functionality.",
            "Great tablet with good battery life ,a clear and sharp screen and good audio . All together a good value  tablet .",
            "The Yoga has unusual design but it's worth it, even when hanging it!\nThe most impressive feature is the sound. Clear & loud.\nThe screen is good with acceptable colours, connectivity is very good even with cellular, performance is good, battery life is good, the camera is not the best part especially in low light.\nIt's a really good mid-range tab that will be approved in most situations but not so high profile games or professional photography. Sound makes a winning point for the Yoga.",
            "Overall a fantastic tablet\n\nPicture quality is great, the flip out stand is fantastic and every tablet need one. \nAlso has face recognition and has a child’s mode so kids can download and play games without being able to get onto anything that is not suitable. \nThe only downside is the battery doesn’t last long.\nBut the design and quality is fantastic and quick.",
            "Fantastic smart tablet, fast and easy set up. The iron grey finish looks very sleek.  The screen is bright and responsive, full HD, amazing quality.  The vivid colour mode is spectacular.  The camera is pretty decent. The sound is great, I love the way the Dolby JBL speakers look at the bottom.  The battery life is great.  It has Google assistant and facial recognition. I love the flick stand at the back and way prefer the design to a flat tablet.  Has a memory card slot. Would highly recommend.",
            "I am very impressed with this tablet. The rounded speaker barrel makes it easy to hold in one hand.\nThe positioning of the speakers give some great acoustics, and battery life seems really good.\nThe screen is very clear, and has a standard android layout.\nThe USP of this product is the little stand that folds down from the back. I feel this is a weak point on the tablet and could lead to it breaking off if used too much.",
            "I bought this because i have the Lonovo laptop and boy was i not disapointed. This is by far one of the best tablets i've ever bought. Very quick loading up, very stylish and easy to use. Love it. Would highly recommend it.",
            "To highlight, the screen size is 10.1 inches and provides the best HD resolution. JBL speakers, at the end of the tablet (both sides) are fantastic, with excellent sound quality. The C-Type charger is very fast and quick while charging. Battery stands for atleast 6-8 hrs, assuming you are watching streaming videos continuously. The apps performance, speed of touch, screen sensitivity are all highly improved. 2GHz octa core processor. 3GB RAM, Extra SD Slot, and best price.Go for it."
