This is cheaper than a kindle as well and it does everything I need it to do. Yes, the graphics of the screen aren't as clear cut as a good tablet, but for the price I paid I can live with that. It's a lovely design. Runs well. Can't fault it really.",

Which is not suitable if you are to buy it for a child like I did. As then they can buy anything and everything. I've not used it since finding this out, I try to return it and they would not accept it, so I might sell on as not for my needs of teaching my child.",

I had an Argos voucher  and nothing else I wanted to use it for and I wanted a tablet so that I could more easily share on screen photos with my wife than I could by phone. So, I am happy with my purchade. However, it is very very slow and has poor battery life. There is no direct access to Play Store apps, although you can find a way around this if you search online. It is dirt cheap and not as bad as the Argos Alba is the best that can be said for it as a device.",

            "Alexa appears to be the best app for me to talk to, voice recognition etc.\nThe apps that rely on google do not work properly. GPS Satellite Navigation etc, hopefully amazon and google will resolve their differences.\nAs an amazon prime user everything is pre installed for my requirements.\nAs a side note, You Tube, Gmail etc can be accessed through a web based app.\nHence my headline.
