            "If you are looking for a tablet around the £100-£150 price range I would recommend this tablet as it beats most of its competition at the price. It's not gonna be the best tablet out there but for a budget it's been class you won't find anything better unless you're willing to spend big money. Only problem that I have with it which isn't that big is the speakers are at the bottom of the device when in landscape but still sounds great for tunes.",
            "I like the Huawei T5, it's a great size with it's 10\" crystal clear screen. It's great for apps, web browsing and e-books. Brilliant picture quality for photos as well. \nThe only downside is mine has frozen a few time when streaming videos, works ok in portrait mode but in full screen it freezes and the some of the apps crash.\nAlso the battery life isn't great, I seem to spend more time charging it than using it.",
            "It will have to go back. Something wrong with it. I bought 4 but this one runs slow.",
            "Earphone port not working.",

            "-Firmware takes 6.28GB out of a total 16GB. \n-you can not use a SIM card. Only wify. \n-you cannot transfer apps to SD card, so overall very limited space for apps, most of it is taken by system apps.",
            "Rubbish you cannot put apps on this  or use a sd card for apps so pointless returned to shop and got trusty lenova tablet so much better",
            "Love it.  Huawei and Google android work really well together.",
            "At last a 10\" tablet that actually does what it is supposed to do. A refreshing change from all others that I have tried. So far everything has gone as expected. I am therefore at the moment completely satisfied.",

            "It is a little slow to respond and the camera isn't the best. It works for us but then again we are only using it for a couple of small jobs using an app. Consider spending more if you need a good one that's quick.",

These apps have earned some notoriety for being resource hungry and somewhat fussy about platform. It's large screen aids composition for aerial photography, which can be rather tricky on a mobile phone. If you want a no frills, well-made tablet then you shouldn't be disappointed.",
            "The good, this tablet was fairly inexpensive. The bad, the tablet only has 2gb of ram, so in some applications is very slow. We knew what we were buying and the main purpose was for a web browsing book reading tablet. This is adequate for this. I do however wish we had bought a better specced tablet",
            "We needed a back-up tablet.  Just for surfing, gmail, ebay, amazon etc.  This is perfect.  Quick and good screen.  Build quality is good for the price too.

            "Bought for my daughter for her birthday. Does everything its expected to do. Good size screen for watching Netflix etc. \nSound is good.. I've asked her to turn it down a few times.. :)",
            "Not a bad tablet for the price. Sleek with a decent operating system.\nHowever, no where near enough memory if you plan on downloading multiple apps.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the expandable storage. Yes it has this but it will only work for your documents and media. Not applications.\n\nSo perfect for viewing your pictures and videos and browsing the web.\n\nNot good if you want to install Netflix, eBay, games etc.",
            "I struggled at first to get certain apps to load but once i navigated that was all good. Good for meetings and communicating with family and friends. Camera and speakers are of great quality. Bought an sd card as memory became full rather quickly. Still have to figure how to get photos to sd card, but other than that all go9d for my needs",
            "Great tablet, working fast, was about to buy a T3 version but found a great offer on that so totally satisfied.",
            "Good quality tablet for the low price. Nicely designed and relatively light weight. Overall pleased with this purchase. So far very happy!",

            "First tablet I have purchased for maybe 10 years. Very pleased with it. Does everything I want to without issues. Camera isnt the greatest but I didn't buy it for that. Hopefully I can add a memory card as its only 16gb and updates have totalled 6gb! All in all im happy.",
            "The great thing is as long as you dont clog it up with apps and work its a great media centre",
            "Excellent tablet for the money and performs very well. I would recommend getting the model with as much storage capacity as possible as you'll soon fill it up especially with the 16GB version.",

            "Great tablet, beautiful screen quality, nice design and pretty powerful. The only problem with it is that the storage is really small - 16GB would be fine if the OS didn't take up 7GB. Doesn't leave much space for apps, although for such an affordable price, the storage isn't too much of a problem.",
            "Brilliant tablet for the price, super fast and sleek",
            "Purchased this for my daughter to play games from the android store.  Excellent price for a decent spec tablet.  You get the confidence of a two year warranty from a premium brand and i felt it was better value for money than the Samsung unit.  We had previously used an Amazon Fire Tablet which died after 14 months and was out of warranty.\n\nThe only draw back is that one game in particular freezes occasionally, i expect that this is an issue with the Android Pie OS and will be ironed out soon.",
            "Brilliant tablet very fast to download films , music etc.\nNice wide screen good volume.easy to use once I figure how to do it lol\nBattery Life isn't bad after watching a film for couple of hours.\nI'm happy",

I was worried that the performance would be compromised with only 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, but it has been nothing but flawless. I have since expanded with a 128GB card so there is no danger of running out of space. Brilliant. Just buy.",

There are time limits that you can adjust easily and it’s very intuitive and all accessed via a parental code\nBrilliant value for money.",
            "A good sized tablet with a descent battery life and very nice feel in the hand.\nTho the bezel looks quite large it isn't noticeable in use as the screen is very clear and bright, perfect for web browsing or streaming video.\nThe built in speakers aren't great but certainly usable, tho for long term use headphones would be a better option.

I wanted an iPad but I didn’t want to spend the amount of money ipads cost especially when I just wanted it to watch movies, you tube, Pinterest and general use. I compared this tablet to others and decided to go with this one. It is fab. It was easy to set up, I could download all the apps I use on my iPhone such as Apple Music.

The only thing I didn’t like is that it’s not 10” it’s a little smaller so it didn’t fit snug into cases so I just bought new ones lol. The graphics are amazing. It is capable of downloading games that the Alba one couldn’t and for the price it is a 10/10!!",

Only down side, for me, although it does support screen rotation the controls and the Huawei Label positioning suggests it is designed to be used in landscape mode.

V8. 1 allows an sd card to be formatted as extended internal memory which this version doesn't.\nother than this disappointment, it works well. Good screen, reasonable sound.

If this isn't an issue for you then this tablet is a must buy.",

If anything the only downside is that the onboard memory is quite small, however this can be overcome by using a micro SD card upto 64 gigabytes which should be enough for most people.\nI bought this on the basis of two things, my fabulous Huawei phone and also the fact that it had better reviews than the pricier Samsung Tab.\nIf you browse the internet and do lots of Social media then this is the tablet for you",

            "The tablet is brilliant, speedy and very responsive. The screen quality is brilliant as well. The only con I'd say is the fact that it is only 16GB internal storage and, although I added an SD Card, you can't install apps in the external storage - so your space is actually limited to 16GB. That said though, I have around 35 apps installed and still have free internal storage space.",

            "The operating system and instorred apps that can't be deleted uses up well over half of the 16GB so if you have even a few apps the memory is full so you cannot even get emails and constant messages saying must free up space to use.\nReturned to Argos and got more expensive 32GB model",

            "Don't buy this tablet it states 16gb but all the apps they have put on takes up most of the gb. Nearly every day telling me to delete stuff as I'm getting to the point of no gb left. If I want to download a new app it tells me to remove one I haven't used for a while. If buying as a Christmas present don't do it. And you can't put a sd card in either.",

            "Bought to replace my old tablet, I am happy with my purchase. Battery life is brilliant and Internet pages load fast. Watching content on you tube and netflix is a pleasure as colours are vibrant. The only niggle I have is that although there are two speakers it sounds quite tinny when playing songs, but fine for watching films. I would also suggest getting 32 GB if you download lots of apps as there's only about 4 GB space left after all factory apps and programmes are installed.",
            "This tablet is exactly what I need for streaming/ downloading movies & tv shows from my favourite apps & reading books. The graphics are brilliant. The screen is the perfect size for watching your favourite shows. You can pair with other devices & load all your existing apps onto it. Just what I need when working away from home.",

It’s not the fastest tablet out there but it’s certainly not the slowest and packs a lot of features for its price point. I have personally always been a fan of Apple, but after giving this android device a go I’ve been more than impressed. Overall I’m very happy with the purchase.",

            "Really good spec, I was really impressed until I discovered the inability to use my microSD card as internal storage. Basically you only have 16gb to use to download apps and 6-10 is already used up by the operating system and bloatware. The microSD can only be used for pics and videos. This is all down to Huawei and they have made the tablet this way and any workaround I have tried doesn’t work. Great tablet, but seriously hampered by poor storage capabilities.",
            "The tablet is heavier then i had assumed but, nit too heavy for regular use, just solid in contruction. I would recommend to all.",

            "I love it....not had any issues with this product. My only problem is that it is difficult to find a case that is suitable.",
            "Good for kids or if you need just a couple of apps, says 16gb but only 5gb usable unless you sit and delete/disable built in apps. Keeps a charge for a good amount of time, few hours play time but crashes often. Doesn't allow working from SD card so can save files to save space but doesn't help performance speeds. Great value product.",

            "Amazing buy. Would recommend.",
            "So far very happy with my Huawie tablet. Always proven to be a reliable make. It is little heavy in the hand, getting a case with a folding stand helps, also protects it. All in all good little tablet, does what I need",

My Mum's only comment was the black power & volume controll buttons, charging outlet and Headset outlet on the black shell, made it difficult to identify what did what.",

            "Replacement for my 6 year old I pad cannot believe how much faster than my old one",
            "Good tablet, well made. Has clear screen and seems to work well.\nOnly downside is on some apps the screen is upside down so the volume control is at the bottom of the tablet instead of top.\nOtherwise we are happy with it.\nGreat value compared to other manufacturers.",
            "Very nice tablet at a very reasonable price, very impressed, would definitely recommend.",
            "Easy to use,long battery life\nPerfect choice for traveling",
            "Great tablet . Well made .works fast clear screen .Downside can't move apps to sd card !",
            "After buying and running out of available storage hours after setting up I tried to install apps to the SD card only to find out this Android feature has been disabled. Rendering the tablet nearly useless I tried to return it to Argos to be refused. Now I'm stuck constantly having to uninstall and reinstall apps.\n\nThis wasn't listed anywhere on the listing page, only that it has a SD card slot",
            "The MediaPad T5 is a slim 10\" tablet running Android which immediately updated to v8.0.0 with the latest security patches, easy to use, easy to disable the unwanted pre-installed software and install the Apps i wanted. screen is 1920*1200 and is clear and bright for photos and videos. Streams Netflix videos without issue.\nI added a 128Gb uSD to store the photos and videos on which was simple to do. Also a folding case to protect the tablet which doubles as a stand. \nA great package.",
            "Excellent for the money. Facial recognition rarely works but other than that no complaints.",
            "Very pleased with the Huawei Tablet. Found it easy to use and get used to. Its camera takes superb quality pictures.",
            "A great android table well designed and perfect size to carry around wherever you go.\nRunning Android 8 OS it’s quicker and nicer to use than previous versions it’s also a great price from Argos",
            "Bought 2 of these for our boys. They are great work really well. They are really enjoying them. You can have family link on there so you can approve apps and limit time etc.",
            "Good value for money . Light easily carried around .",
            "Fantastic products, would recommend these to everyone, really fast compared to other tablets we've had before, we bought 1 each for the boys and they love them",
            "Very good kigs enjoy and play battery power good game",
            "While this tablet performs well there is a major flaw with the design... Namely you cannot install apps onto the removable micro SD card. Therefore with only 16 gb of internal memory it isn't going to be too long before the memory is full. I'm not sure whether Huawei will in the future change this but if they decide not to, then I foresee problems. Had I known this before buying this tablet I would have opted for another make.",
            "This product is really excellent and easy to use. I don't have any negative comments at all. I would recommend this mediapad to anyone and the cameras are brilliant. Go ahead treat yourself you won't be disappointed",

            "a far better tablet than our previous acer which packed up after 2 years.",
            "As a hardcore tablet user I was very happy with this product. I choose this one because it gave best performance for the money.\nIts not the cheapest, or the fastest tablet out there....but you would struggle to find another that gives this performance for the price. \nIt seems fairly robust and quite slim, although I have mine in a chunky case to protect it. \nIt was my first Huawei product and I would buy from them again.",
            "Love my Hauwei T5 10 inch tablet. Looks and feels great, quality build.  Very pleased with its all round performance.",
            "Grt tablet, v fast, easy to use with a really bright natural colour screen. The Huawei GUI is good. Memory size ok. To insert /remove the micro SD card you have to insert the silly supplied pin into a tiny hole to eject a very flimsy carriage, place the SD card in the carriage & carefully insert into the thin slot. As I have to do it often it's a real pain & very fiddly. I've lost the pin many times. This stupid design is the only thing that let's down a really great piece of kit for the price.",
            "I purchased it because the price was lower than the Samsung tablet, as a person who has always bought Samsung I thought I would try this one. It is absolutely awesome in every category. I would very highly recommend it.",
            "Very good tablet! I really recommend!!!",
            "Considering the price, this is a great tablet and worth spending a little extra over the T3. Screen is great. Can play games well (games for kids I've only tried so far). Googles recent announcements re Huawei may put some people off.",
            "I have had this tab for a couple months now and I am still very impressed by it. The battery life is incredible, I am probably a light user only Web browsing most of the time and emails, but I do use it for music streaming and I probably get 3 to 4 days out ot it before I need to charge it. The sound performance is also very good for a tablet and has good stereo separation, and volume is very good. The screen is nice and sharp, video and still photos look nice and natural on it.",
            "Love this bit of tech picture quality close to 3D clear an crisp tends to freeze a little other than that a great purchase Android all day long!!!!",
            "My dad who is late 50's loves it. He has replaced a laptop for this. Ideal for everything",
            "The tablet has a nice design and I use it to read books and watch TV shows. \nI recommended it to my friend who bought the smaller version for her son and she is also very happy with the purchase.",
            "Price - perfect\nPerformance - excellent\nDoes the job. Dont waste your money on bigger brands. This one is just perfect.",
            "Very fast Octa core CPU. comfortable to use   plenty of power very  good  screen  saturation  &   çolour very  good  battery  life  does  everything. You  need  &  more  just as  fast  as  the  load.",
            "Intuitive to use; battery life is amazing, my daughter needs a lot of time to make it stop working.",
            "Better than I expected, looks stunning graphics wise. It's very sensitive, sometimes too sensitive but a minor gripe. Extremely happy!",
            "Considering the low price the performance is excellent. I use it for surfing the net, YouTube and email, it performs superbly and battery life is good, especially in standby. I would recommend this tablet.",
            "pro - the display is great\ncon - storage is small and for installing apps you can't switch to the micro sd card.",
            "I've always been an ipad girl and never thought I would change but, after hearing really good things about this tablet I decided to buy one. It is brilliant, the size is great, better than my old tablet and the picture quality and sound are outstanding. I am so glad I bought this tablet and would deffinately recommend it to others",
            "Easy to use and easy to set up does what I want it to do I'm delighted with it",
            "Hard to find a negative with this lovely product",
            "Everything about the purchase was easy and quick. The service I received was excellent.",
            "Really happy that I bought this tablet, it's light weight but sturdy enough do its not flimsy. It can run a little slow at times but isn't a major issue. Definitely worth the price! It does the same if not more than other tablets that are much more expensive.",
            "Well pleased argos great as usual. Why go anywhere else. So fast for a tablet get what you pay for. Huawei brilliant gear. Just buy.",
            "Excellent tablet does everything i need it to do",

            "This tablet was bought by my 17 year old son. He has had other tablets of various brands but this Huawei is the best by far. Battery life extremely good, long lasting, quality finish good large size and performance really good. The only thing which would improve the item is if it came with a protective case. Would recommend this item.",
            "Good for the money, but it's not an iPad",
            "Perfectly doing what it has to do. Definitely worth the price",

            "I bought this tablet as I have the Huawei phone, fantastic tablet, can't fault it! Excellent price too.",
            "I'm extremely surprised at how capable this tablet is. It's fast, the screen is bright and vivid, the speakers are loud (if not the greatest), battery life is good, it's thin and it has dual cameras. The only thing I can criticize is the camera quality which is pretty poor, but consider that you'll rarely use the cameras and that this tablet is four times cheaper than an ipad, so you can forgive it. Highly recommended.",
            "Very pleased with this tablet colours and sound better than my previous galaxy e tablet",
            "It has only been a couple of weeks since purchase - I can't fault it, good performance has excellent speed, aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. Also relative to 'big' brands with similar spec this tablet is competitively priced, most happy with my purchase.",
            "Well worth the money product works great",
            "Good price and does everything i want",
            "Nice tablet for the price. Wasnt sure about 2GB Ram but its enough for browsing and steaming films. So much cheaper than an iPad.",
            "Brill tablet does everything I need",
            "Very good product, worth the money",
            "The T5 performs very well, excellent screen image and app speed. An issue with screen rotation on certain apps but no big deal still an excellent tablet for the money.",
            "I bought the Huawei Mediapad T5 to replace my old Samsung Galaxy tablet. The performance is very impressive with excellent picture and audio quality. The battery life is not as long as my previous tablet but recharges very quickly. I would definitely recommend.",

            "Replacement for old tablet. Brilliant.",
            "Best tablet I've had,easy to use,the battery life is good.watching a movie or Netflix is amazing. Games are very good.i put a 128 gb micro sd card in it with all my music and films on,work with no problems. Have already recommended to a friend and they have bought one aswel",
            "I owned a couple of Lenovo tablets previously but was getting exasperated with how slow they became and lately the battery didn't last as well as it used to do so I found the Media Pad T5 and I'm glad I did. Tablet is thin, light, fast, battery life it's excellent, when I open apps it doesn't \"hang\" like my old one used to and you can use a Micro SD card. The only gripe it's the placement of the volume and power buttons when I have it in portrait mode.\nIf you need a tablet I recommend!",
            "Love it so much, its easy to use light weight alot better then my phone as I can put it on charge and use my headphones at the same time",
            "glad i ordered this tablet , well worth the money , easy to use , highly reccomend it !!!",
            "Reliable and good looking at a affordable price, You should defiantly consider these tablets",
            "This tablet was a birthday present. My brother liked the tablet but worried that it was Chinese hence he turned off anything relating to his data. Only issue was I couldn’t  find a a cover for this model in Argos.",
            "Would definitely recommend, great build quality...",
            "It's a very smart tablet bought for downloading movies for long flights and general use. Beautiful screen, movies look great and battery life is good.",
            "This tablet is great quality, the design and feel of it is far better than some of the ones we've had and the performance is brilliant.. The processor speed is actually faster than some of the more expensive items, that with its excellent feel and design makes this one of the best we've used.. If you want a really good all round tablet and at a great price, this is one to take a serious look at.. A good size ram, a great processor speed and enough space for the usual browsing and games..",
            "Unlike their phones they've restricted the feature to allow app storage on the SD card. Even choosing SD card as default storage, downloads still tries to store internally. With OS and pre-installed apps you cant remove, only left with about 2GB spare for own apps and things like ebooks, offline netflix etc. On/Off button hard to feel/find which drove me nuts. Very slippery to hold. Not the best resolution. Good sound from speakers and decent battery life, but wouldn't recommend.",
            "I bought this tablet to replace my Old Asus Tablet which did me well for years. This Tablet however is a different class nae Planet. Marvelous in all fields. Really can't believe I got it for the price I paid at Argos. Really chuffed",
            "Bought this as an alternative to my ipad really pleased with it picture is great its fast, large keyboard would definitely buy again much better than my previous Lenovo",
            "The larger keypad makes it a lot easier to use. Fast response on what ever I ask it to do. Good size. Very pleased",
            "Really impressed with this company, ended up with their phone, and got to say the tablet just as good, easy to use, fast, great quality all round",
            "I've had this tablet twice now, as my first one was stolen. For the price it's very good. The cameras are no good in it if you seriously want to use those, and the battery doesn't last too long, though it's adequate, but the design and feel is great, the screen and picture quality is outstanding, and there are some nice little features such as face recognition, wireless keyboard and stand I bought separately, and free Microsoft Word.",
            "OK for basic use but if you like apps this is not for you. Over half of the 16gb memory is used by system apps, which leaves less than 8gb for personal apps, pics, vids etc not great.",
            "Really enjoying using this tablet.  I haven't had much experience with this sort of technology but find it quite easy to use. Would definitely recommend.",
            "As expected, nice tablet to allow the kids to use to various reasons.",
            "It looks neat and feels solid. Mine had 2GB of RAM + 16GB of storage. Sadly, after auto-updating itself the tablet had just 7GB of storage left for apps. Even worse, HUAWEI won't let you add an SD card to expand internal (sic) storage for anything but files, documents, photos, etc. No apps on the SD card. This seemed wrong to me, so I returned the tablet. A 32GB model would be a better buy, but HUAWEI's ridiculously restrictive OS is still a serious flaw, in my opinion.",
            "This is worth the price every penny \n\nSceeen is great  compared to others for this price range \n Ram is low but cpu stands up to  any challenge.\n\nGreat item for the price.",
            "A very easy to set up and use tablet, and very quick so far. My only issue is that even though it's advertised as having 16GB of storage, the operating system and inbuilt apps (most of which you can't uninstall) takes up 11GB so there isn't much lest by the time you've downloaded your own apps. If you're thinking of  storing lots of films, TV shows, music etc then you will definitely need extra storage.",
            "Excellent all round.",
            "I brought the T3 tablet originally but was very slow and laggy. This was refunded in replacement for this item. Design is great however when you use sertain apps, the screen even if locked does rotate and if your balancing on your lap will turn off the screen as it rotates to the power button. Annoying.  Huawei software has quite a few bugs so was refunded and no replacement was reached.",
            "bought for my son really  easy to use  ..great image and great baterry life.",
            "Good deal. Price and quality= Huawei.",

            "Wanted an upgrade to the kindle fire 7\" tablet,  main criteria was a bigger screen to maker things easier to read.\n\nThis is bang on, very thin, very light and very fast. \n\nAt the price you can't go wrong.",

            "My husband needed a powerful tablet to do his photo editing and recording of music, as a lap top was out of our price range (for what he needed).\nHis produced songs, and has edited videos and photos.\nThe tablet hasnt lagged, or crashed, and after about a month of use it still isn't struggling.\nFor the price of the tablet, and what my husband is doing it is an absolute bargain! \n\nHighly recommended!",

            "Great little tablet.",
            "I use it for watching Netflix and YouTube videos, for these tasks it is amazing, screen is very good and stereo speakers add to the enjoyability. Aluminium construction gives this tablet a premium feel. Only 16gb on board memory but its easy to put a micro sd card in to it.",
            "Being totally honest, I was a little hesitant in getting a Huawei tablet, and I was unsure a cheaper tablet could give me the performance I wanted. I needed not have worried because the T5 Mediapad is perfect for me, and gives excellent performance in all ways. Having owned and used the more expensive tablets, I can see no sense in going back to them. The T5 Mediapad has great design, is fast, is easy to use, has a great screen and wonderful display and immense battery life. Highly recommended",
            "If you're looking for a capable android tablet then this is the one.\nIt's not going to play high end games, but for the mainstay of browsing, Netflix, media and music playback etc. This tablet hits all the correct points. \n\nThe only annoying problem is the power button, it's located on the right hand side if you view the tablet in landscape mode, traditionally power buttons are on the top when in landscape mode. \n\nOther than that, it's spot on!",
            "Really good tablet has kept up will all games and apps weve put on it and have pjt movies onto an external dvd card. Really pleased with it and would like another.",

            "This is a good value for money smart looking Android 8 tablet. Ideal for general use and in our case controlling a google TV dongle. The only slight downsides are some useless apps and largish icons which you can't seem to downsize. Bought as my old pad wouldn't run. some modern apps. Light to hold and far too popular with my grandchild.",
            "Good product, for this price i think is OK",
            "I purchased this for my 8 year old son for Christmas after his other tablet by a well known brand starting with S had a fault after only 3 days! This is far smoother to use, faster and so far no issues. Battery life isn't the best however it is used for online games/apps by a child so it's bound to need charging often.",

Robust construction, sound and picture quality very good. Battery life appears strong compared to other tablets with similar use. Easy to set up and good warranty. Wife loves it, comments that it is a little heavy in long term use but that's likely common issue.",
            "I treated myself to this as a replacement for another Huawei 10\" tablet I bought last year and managed to break the screen. I bought it, because I rate the brand very highly. I'ts slimmer than the older model, a tad lighter and like the other one, very nicely finished off.\n\nIt could be my imagination, but I think it runs a little slower than the old one however, the display appears crisper. The sound is better too. If you are not familiar with this Chinese brand, give it a try.",

            "Always been with Apple until the cloud lost my stuff. Still reluctant to do the android thing but after purchasing this I should have done it sooner! I was rely impressed with my Huawei phone so got this too. I have had this just over a month and it hasn't missed a beat. Battery life is good. Performance is instant (I only watch YouTube videos and listen to music) but my ipad4 struggled sometimes. Does what I need it to do very well.",

            "This tablet is great value. It works smoothly and has a great battery life, better than my ipad! Made of metal mainly, feels more expensive than it was. Daughter very happy with it as she can play all her games on it. Great tablet. Only negative is that it does not have fast charge.",
            "Perfect tablet,my dougther love it",

            "Brought the Huawei Mediapad T5 10 Inch Tablet as a birthday present for my mum. She finds It easy to use and navigate around the various functions and apps, the screen is big and bright and the battery lasts a reasonable amount of time. She's very happy with it.",
            "Using this every day\nAll day\nI haven't found anything I can't do with it.\nSo happy with my purchase",
            "Excellent value for money",
            "Bought this to replace an ageing iPad and haven't been disappointed. It came with Android Oreo, same as my phone, so easy to use.\nThe screen is bright under most circumstances and I find the screen responsive.\nI watched some TV using Nowtv and a VPN through a hotspot on my phone, while on holiday and it performed well.\nI also played some videos on a USB stick using an OTG cable and no problems to report.\nI wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.",
            "this tablet is excellent in both picture quality and sound. easy to use and reasonably quick.",
            "Super product in every way and excellent quality and value",
            "Love everything about it",
            "I'm happy with tablet, working fast good battery life.",
            "Very good service and I will be recommending\nThis to friends great product",
            "great,clear, crisp screen. speakers sounds ok. there is not too much bloatware to slow it down, so the performance is really pretty good.\nmore than happy with it for the money, it does everything i needed it to good very well",
            "This is a good quality tablet , very quick processing speed and good screen resolution, The price and spec sets it at a mid range device and it's not bad at all. It's as good as any Samsung mid range tablet. It's easy to see why Huawei have become more popular in recent years.",
            "Nice quality you can't go wrong so simple to set up good value for money just buy it.",
            "Great quality and value for money and clear screen.fast when searching for your email and colours are very true to format.",
            "This was a buy to complement an ipad that our family had used forever, so was a bit sceptical about it. For the price though, it is wonderful. Easy to setup, easy to use. Could have had a quicker processor but it is the price I paid so no regrets. Wonderful ally at home and much in demand by my 8 year old! Loved it.",
            "A tablet was needed purely for web browsing, emailing etc and this fits the bill.",
            "she is using it as help to learn and its quiet good enough fast and sharp she enjoying it",
            "Absolutely fantastic product. Great battery life and quick game downloads. There is also Microsoft office installed which is a bonus. Works great... we ordered a case from amazon which protects this media tab v well.",
            "nice looking and performs really welll",
            "It's good for multi tasking and it's fast and easy to get used to. Very happy with it and it was a good price.",
            "Reasonable quality product, case is very slippery, so need a case for it, quick processor, use your fingers & not a stylus pen, as it responds better without, too much bloat ware, software not needed, some android software has a heavy drain on the battery. Old Micro USB, so will take sometime to replenish the battery.\nIf you want good pictures, don't buy this one, front camera 2 MP & back is 5 MP.",
            "Does what is says on the tin reasonably priced",
            "Excellent tablet. Great features and design. Fantastic value and quality. Highly recommended.",
            "I normally use Samsung on the day to day basics but it surprised me in good way. I definitely feels as more expensive product  and also performs like one too. Only thing is when you set it up for the first time you get a lot options (which some you have to pay for) to back up everything using Huawei products. Just need to be careful and read what it offers other way you will end up paying for something that may actually be free (Google Photos).",
            "Bought for my partner as a replacement for her old one.I can honestly say she absolutely loves it",
            "I bought it for myself, its not too complicated, I'm 71 and not too clever on the Internet but this was easy from the start.",
            "Gt dffgbhhuuygfdddfxxxa@",
            "It is slow, press an on screen icon and there is a delay which means you instinctively go for a second press plus the screen from time to time needs a proper hard press to respond.\nSome things just don't make sense, ie widgets sometime work, sometimes do not even though the screen is active, or, sometimes the screen can only offer portrait view in one direction. \nCharging port is the old USB style, and is slow compared to other Huawei devices I have plus the battery isn't great at all.",
            "Having looked closely at various tablets eventually chose this. So pleased i did as it compares and performs as good as the more expensive ones. First time moved away from Samsung so far no regrets.",
            "Great little Tablet for the money, no problems so far",
            "Slim but solidly made and the use of aluminium casing gives it a feel you'd find in higher priced devices. Screen display is quite good with decent pixel density. The power button is towards the top right side if you're using it in landscape mode and I've found myself turning it off accidentally now and then but I expect I'll get used to it.\n\nI went for this because my more expensive Samsung Tab E started playing up after 3 years and so far I think the Huawei is on the same level as the Tab E",
            "Great tablet. Nice big display and running Android 8 (Oreo) which is something I particularly needed. Seems to load apps quickly and has a good quality feel to it.",
            "Nicely packaged. Looks good, build quality great, its a perfect mid range tablet. It's more than fast enough, the screen is fantastic for fulms/YouTube etc. The speakers are adequate, battery OK, and it plays most 3d games well. I recommend it to anyone."
