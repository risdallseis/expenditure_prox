            "Good Quality, simple to set up, lightweight, reliable.  No issues as yet",
            "Read reviews online and settled on this one as it has some great features in comparison to others.\nBought for my mum who was used to a Samsung tablet anyway, she picked it up very quickly. Much quicker and better sound than previous version.\nVery pleased with purchase.",
            "Good device, good size and videos can watch amazing",
            "The tablet is awesome,fast software.",
            "I love itcthe battery  lasts 12-14 hrs its slim easy ,I wasn't  sure if I would use it but its so much easier  than my laptop  I use it daily.",
            "so much quicker than my old tablet. should have made the change sooer",
            "From taking it out of the box switching on I was away,u easy set up, great graphics colours sharp and so much faster than my previous tablet. Great Product, I have already recommended to a friend.",
            "great design,excellent screen.best tablet ive owned",
            "Great product great price and delivered on time by a professional with great customer services skills. Well done argos",
            "Great tablet,bought it to replace my old kindle,read a couple of worrying reviews but most where good so went for it and I am very pleased with it",
            "Straight out of the box, the battery drain was absolutely horrendous. \nWent from 100% to 18% in less than 3 hours. Gave it another full charge and same again.\nWas going to box it back up and return it, but gave it a full factory reset and touch wood getting a good day out of it now.",
            "Really pleased I decided to upgrade rather than go with the cheaper versions.  This is real quality.",
            "Really good tablet, good quality of screen and image. Does not support S pen so does not proving palm rejection when taking notes with a pen",
            "Very slim and a bit slippy. The 'off' switch really difficult to operate, especially for the first couple of weeks as you have to hold both the power and the volume switches together and then the Power Off sign comes up - but I still haven't got the knack of doing it straight off. It's pot luck. A stupid system in my opinion. The 'back' arrow isn't a switch as on my previous tablet, it just comes up when you touch the screen. Camera is good.",
            "Would recommend this product also bought the key pad cover",
            "Very pleased with my new tablet, fast and very clear vivd screen. Happy customer",
            "This was an upgrade of my 7 year old Google Nexus Tablet, it was quick to set up, the battery has been fantastic. I think this is the cheapest price for the screen quality, it certainly was that I found, when I shopped around. \nThe touch screen is very sensitive, so you need to be careful where you tap. \nOverall it's a fantastic tablet, happily recommended",
            "Tablet was great to start with until the Android 10 update. After that the tablet freezes quite often and is unusable. Have tried clearing system cache and even reformatted it, but still no joy. If I could get this fixed I would give itn5 stars.",
            "My tab look and work great, I love it very much",

            "Brilliant Screen for Movies, Sound awesome and beautiful to look at; and I thought my Tab S was terrific. Sadly this beauty keeps dropping its WIFI connection, something that never ever happened with my Tab S!! and you Smartswitch is not as smart as it used to be, having used it before many times on all our phones.",
            "In short, this tablet is not as good as my old tabs. Even as I write this it is freezing up but the main issue is that it will not always connect to the internet.  My husband, who has taken over my old tablet, can be sitting next to me and he can connect to the internet but I can't.  I don't like the smaller keyboard either. If my old tablet had not started to lose its charge quickly I would not have changed.",
            "excellent display excellent quality sound and speed is increased 128gb with 6gb gives much more flexibility also so light and slim",
            "Have had a Galaxy Tab A for a few years.  Bought this as a faster, better replacement.  It does everything I need it to do, and how I expect it to.",
            "Screen resolution is very good, but wifi and face recognition poor",
            "just love it much better than i pad ,purchased  brand new ipad 12 months before Galaxy and twice in 12 months had WHITE SCREEN OF DEATH !!! Would never buy apple again",
            "i really recommend buy this as this low price and you can do allt of things on it",
            "Pretty good tablet overall, quick and responsive. Lack of a standard headphone jack is issue and if I had picked up on this before purchase it would have stopped me buying it.",
            "Top quality product as expected. running little slow lately. New one needed s7 on the cards...",
            "It's great size tablet with lots of features. Great for everyday use or playing games az well as casual browsing or listening to music.\nPros: Great sound, great video quality, nice size, easy to use, smooth experience, beautiful design \nCons: no option to switch vibrations on",
            "This tablet is a brilliant media device that I use on a daily bases to watch netflix/YouTube etc as well as 95% of my daily computing needs. \n\nthe build quality is excellent and the battery life is good. I never find myself getting caught short.",
            "This is the 3rd  Tablet that I  have had ,  as the first 2 were  faulty  I was giving this one the last chance to work  so far it works well",
            "Having bought the S5e I'm amazed at the quality of the picture, the sound and the speed",
            "Nice and light to hold, great screen and display, but sometimes freezes since the new android update",
            "This is a very nice tablet, with a very clear screen and fast operation. We have had a number of Samsung items including TV's, tablets and mobile phones over many years.  We now have two Samsung S5e's, the only problem is that they don't automatic reconnect to my home internet when they are turned on. We don't have the same problem with our Samsung old tablet and mobile phones.",
            "The tablet is absolutely amazing very useful and simple to use, i can't complain to be honest, very well made and the sound is just spectacular, well done samsung you've to be proud of your products.",
            "omg the sound on this tablet just blew me away it takes watching films or listening to music to a whole new level. The tablet is like using my s10e i can make calls receive calls I have used it every day since I got it was using A fire 10 before which I have now given to my son.",
            "I loved my tablet when I first got it.  However after a recent update it continually freezes or the UI stops working.  It's only good for throwing across the room these days.",
            "speed and the picture/screen quality is amazing!!!",
            "Certain Apps open in Portrait while others open in Landscape and switch to portrait in certain features even though I have disabled screen rotation.  Pictures and some facebook images open far too large even though settings are minimal. Won't let me install banking, displays an error code that Samsung inform me doesn't exist! \nSound quality is excellent, battery life is average, kind of wish I had stuck with iPad though!",
            "the WiFi is disappointing, it is very insensitive and if you hold it the wrong way you can completely  block the signal from reaching the antenna.\nNow with the upgrade to Android 10 a bug has been introduced which means that every time you power it up (every day in my case) you have to turn the WiFi off and then on again before it will connect to any of your saved networks.",
            "I have a Samsung phone and have always found them very good. \nSo after having a ipad for a few years decided to invest in the Samsung  S5E .\nI am very disappointed in this tablet . When starting the tablet up I have to manually turn off the WiFi on the tablet and then turn it on again before it will connect. It often freezes, and can be slow to load pages. \nI have  very fast wifi and have no issues with any other devices that are used in my household. \nIn future I will stick with an ipad when purchasing a tablet.",
            "Love my tablet.  Its slim and easy to use . Great screen , very crisp and clear.  \nMy only quibble is no earphone socket so I couldn't take it to use when in hospital recently .",
            "Not as good as I expected, very slow and slow to respond, came from an ipad and when I change again will go back to apple, as their performance is far better than this tablet",
            "Great ,no photo bot its quality is good. Love it.bye.",
            "I find it easy to use and this is my second Samsung tablet . I am not a tech savvy person but find this presents no problem  for me surfing the Internet.",

            "The tab his fantastic and its take wonderful picture the best",
            "An absolutely fantastic well made small tablet, coupled with the keyboard folio it's absolutely bang on, I did have some concerns over the processor and ram being up to the job as I use the device for work and some of the software we use can be pretty heavy duty but it manages it extremely well.",
            "I love Samsung devices and tablets!  I have had a Samsung S series from the S4.  I still have an S6, S8, S9, S10, S10 Plus, Tab S, Tab S5e!  I'm a Samsung fan for the design, the One.UI (the best OS), the fluidity and the eco system!  The photographic sector always at the top!  The only drawback the battery, not up to the competitors!",
            "I own tab A 10.5 and I wanted the s5e as its more lighter and nicer display. I like the fingerprint  scanner which always  works first time. It has amazed me.   Its a beautiful tablet and its a pleasure  to  watch  movies on it and listening to  music. Now its got upgraded to 2.1 which makes it run smoothly.  So all in all im happy I bought this tablet.",
            "Investment. Superb build / feel / quality. OLED pin sharp screen. Fast, long lasting microchip. 64 Gb ssd storage & I put in a 128 Gb micro sd card. Fingerprint scanner. I mainly use it for games and reading. Use Xbox game pass & NVIDIA GeForce Now cloud gaming. I use this tablet everyday and haven’t used my gaming laptop for ages. Fast screen, which is glorious in every way possible. The best screen out there. The Samsung user interface is clever, fast and rewarding. This tablet should of been more expensive, I feel guilty that I had such an amazing buy. Don’t use my shield gaming tablet anymore as I have this. Secure, reliable, fast and soo light. Battery is amazing and charges almost instantly. Always wanted this make and spec, but now I have it due to the price being affordable. This is my one stop for all and I bought a leather case and Bluetooth rechargeable pen. Hurry while stocks last. OLED all the way. Samsung is now my brand and I’m not going anywhere else in future. Flawless. Respect where it is due. Unbeatable",
            "It has 4 speakers which I love because I am a little bit harder hearing and yet I can hear the Sound out of the speakers The fingerprint and the  Code is very useful  The only downside for me is there's no Jack Headphone Jack I knew will need to buy a cover for it a bit slippery in your hands",
            "Good Battery life easily lasts for a full day, fast and responsive touch screen",
            "I bought  a tablet for games a few days ago.\nThat is the best present I've made to myself , apart from the car.\nIt works beautifully.  \nWould never imagine use anything else than Samsung. \nThe best phones , tablets,  and I'm looking for a tv now.\nI hope my wife doesn't object  ( she will not) :):):):)",
            "It's a fantastic, tablet. Great sounds and very light to hold. The display is great good battery  life.  I love watching Netflix and YouTube videos.",
            "Glorified phone that is out of date and does not function as a tablet as the ipad does and does not work as a PC in DEX mode.",
            "Suits my purpose and needed it",
            "Very easy to set up. No problems in use.very nice looking unit. AM VERY PLEASED WITH IT",
            "Excellent performance. Light and easy to use. Highly recommended.",
            "Great tablet only problem is the finger print scanner is awkward to use. Other than that is typical Samsung.",
            "I was looking for a tablet for every day use and I choose this one because of the price I don't think u need more expensive one. This one does everything u need .If u want to spend more money on tab s6 ok but do u really need it .speakers are amazing gaming is good perfect. Battery just wow it's better then tab 6 around 15 hours .",
            "Bought to replace an old Xperia unit,  noticeably quicker performance, dissappointed you need an adaptor cable for headphones (included) and no pen included with the tablet, bought keyboard case with it and works well as a mini notebook for work",
            "Long lasting battery life and easy to carry. Great and recommended!",

            "Good price for, not expensive than the other seller's for the same specs.",
            "Bought as replacement for Galaxy Tab A.  Performs as well as expected.  Particularly like the capability to add memory via additional card.",
            "My first tablet having used laptops before. Wanted an android device, did some comparisons and the Galaxy S5e suited my needs. Screen image is great for watching movies, live sports etc. Very good battery life. Bought a cover to protect it. Would recommend to anyone who does not want a pen/stylus for drawing on the screen.",
            "The tablet is very light and thin, which may not be suitable for those who aren't careful with their devices. If you'd like to buy the corresponding keyboard case it's over 1/3 of the price of the tablet which seems excessive. The tablet is fast, as is the side mounted fingerprint sensor. The tablet is extremely attractive, with slim borders are a matte metal design which makes it appear more premium than it is. The camera is of low quality, but not really the intended and common use of a tablet. The tablet handles high graphics games well and doesn't overheat. The battery life of course depends on usage, with heavy usage lasting easily 12 hours. Overall a good mid-range tablet, which is relatively affordable. Would definitely recommend. Review after 6 months of usage, little battery deterioration, nor scratches to the screen or body of tablet. Tablet stills runs smootly",
            "This was bought for my elderly father so he can join in with zoom and Face Time chats. Easy to set up and my Dad finds it easy to use. Very pleased with it.",

            "Replaced an existing Samsung tablet.  But still got the same great quality and performance I expected from Samsung.",
            "Best one I ever had! Clear graphics excellent battery life and amazing sound quality well worth the money. Would recommend it to anyone.",
            "It has got all the features \nBut don't have sim slot",
            "The Samsung tablet is small and slim a lot of the programs are pre loaded onto to system already, it’s very well made.",
            "Display not working from the beginning and due to this difficult time refused exchange, almost three weeks past.",
            "Excellent tablet. Good, clear screen size with vibrant colours. Fast web browsing and easy to set up. Argos delivered quickly.",
            "This was to replace my S2 8 inch tablet. Took me a couple of days to get used to the size as I usually get the smaller tablets. The sound is clear and camera, video quality very good. The colours are vivid and bright. 128GB memory. The octacore processors make web browsing quick. There is no jack socket for headphones so if you wanted to listen to music with headphones it would have to be via bluetooth. Battery life is pretty good. I love Samsung, very user friendly and Argos delivered promptly.",
            "Amazing choice and service",
            "Device is perfect size, not too bulky or heavy, its quick and has plenty of memory, cant fault it!",
            "A very good tablet another fine Samsung product",
            "Because of lockdown I decided to buy this for my granddaughter to do her homework on. Its lightweight and very slim. Ideal for her to work on. Only down side is that it doesnt have a headphone jack. However that is easily sorted by buying an adapter for a few pounds. One end fits into the charging port and the other to the headphone jack so does the job fine. \nThink I might replace my galaxy tab 3 as I like it so much.",
            "Excellent product works as intended.",
            "My daughter loves it",
            "Excellent tablet with a very good battery life. Easy to use and very portable. \nExcellent service and delivered on time.",
            "Very fast, portable and has a great screen and camera. I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to an iPad.",
            "It's a brilliant tablet, very quick, easy to use, gorgeous screen....but mine still hasn't been updated (Security Updates) since January 1st! The latest so far is April 1st 2020, that's not acceptable, but if you can see past that important issue, then go for it, you won't be disappointed.",
            "Bought armour plate case.. Excellent",
            "I am a tech geek and I am in love with this tablet, I highly recommend it",
            "Perfect to replace my old tablet.",
            "Very fine tablet, worth the price!",
            "Can't fault this tablet so far once you get used to different screen options your quickly and easily off to a speedy browsing experience and the 128gb memory and 6gb ram keep this tablet up to speed",
            "It's a nice product with a quality feel. However if you are planning to run games such as Fortnite it's probably not quite up to the job and you'd be better of with the S6. The sound quality is excellent and it plays HD netflix like a dream.",
            "And for playing some games suduku and the like I bought the 5 on the reviews and so far has lived up to expectation in everything I use it for My next purchase will be a Samsung s20 ultra Hoping they will be a good fit",
            "For the price you pay, you get an amazing tablet which works a treat.  Screen resolution is amazing and if you don't care about HDR in a tablet, this is one to get.  Highly recommended!",
            "Only had it for a short time, but it blows me away. Its very thin and it is lightweight which ticks the main box in terms of my requirements. I travel a lot and I try and travel light. Lugging a laptop with me has basically driven me nuts. This S5e solves that problem once and for all. Plus I'm \"old\" and my eyesight and hearing is not the best! This display is bight and because of the OLED black is black, text is just so easy to read. As for the sound, it is far the best on any device I own so clear and bright.\n\nFor work I use Office 365, which is well supported in Android and I can easily acomplish all of my daily tasks with this device. For relaxation, I listen to music, watch video's and play the odd easy game. This device has the potential to be one of the few, best devices I have ever purchased. I don't say that lightly as the only other device that has rightly achived that acolade is my Delongi ECAM bean to cup machine!",
            "Had a Samsung before which is very old. This Samsung tablet is really good. So easy to get it up and running. Battery life is very good. Haven't tried all of the things it can do - that will take me bit of time - need the granddaughters to sort me out with it - but I am really pleased with it. I recommend Samsung, and this tablet is just what I wanted.",
            "I've had this for about 6 months. It is very good for media consumption but that is it. Want to do brousing on the internet or edit a word document and it struggles, slows and lags around. This tablet has so much potential with a rubbish processor so is just slowed and stops the use of the amazing screen in games or just day to day internet usage. Do not buy this I would think that the S6 would be way better just because of the better processor.",
            "Sending this back. Really annoying as it is great in every way. BUT Samsung decided not to include a headphone jack \"to make the tablet thinner\"!! I foolishly didn't think to check if it had a headphone jack as I didn't think Samsung were foolish enough to lose it. There are plenty of thin tablets out there with headphone jacks but now, if I want a Samsung S5e tablet, I have to throw my expensive Sennheiser away and splash out on a new bluetooth headset (which I will have to remember to charge) to watch movies on my daily commute and the inbuilt speakers are pretty useless. How much thickness did you save Samsung?? 0.5mm??? Well that lost you this sale and others.",
            "Highly recommended. Great product. Great value. Very happy customer .",
            "Love  the size of the screen,  it's also very light. Picture quality is awesome",
            "Received this S5e as gift from husband who has S2. This has microsoft word excel PowerPoint onenote Skype onedrive as standard usable without subscription.  This has office mobile and onedrive but cannot use office suite without agreeing to subscription? Why?",
            "Brilliant worth the money",
            "have been using now for around a month, and it is fab, I am an apple convert and used to use the Ipad Pro 12.9 however, i wanted something smaller and this is perfect, I brought a cheap and nasty keyboard, but will upgrade to the samsung one in time, video is great sound is great what is not to love",
            "Well recommended if you need more storage space, a bigger screen, a faster performance and a tablet which handles pretty much anything. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e is the best tablet I have seen so far.",
            "The tablet is just what I need with lots of memory space and cheaper at Argos despite other websites stating the opposite.  It is always Argos' prices.",
            "Seems like a great tablet for the price.",
            "It is perfect for my son. He is using at school and it is everything he need",
            "Lovely tablet, easy to set up and use.  This was an update to my old s2 tablet which I was always happy with.  Even more happy with this new one.  Well done Samsung.",
            "One of the most modern Samsung models. This purchase however, was old original stock. It had to update nearly 12 months of android updates. Just give yourself plenty of time before use!",
            "Good price\nSlim\nGood memory",
            "What I wanted ideal for gaming and web search",
            "I like the size as getting older anything smaller I struggle with \nNice clear screen so far i am still working out what everything does as have up till now always had apple but this Samsung i like very much \nGood buy",
            "Had for 2 months changed from an iPad pro and in many ways this tablet is so much better then that was. the sound is unbelievable and the screen is unreal I have the 4gb and its brilliant for everything apart from the most demanding of games maby the 6gb would be better. but still very happy with it and I am comparing a sub £400 tab to one that was pretty much £1000 so take for that what you will.",
            "My son loves this tablet.\nDid lots of research before purchasing  and finally settled on a Samsung and defiantly not disappointed.",
            "I bought a week ago, a really good upgrade after 2016 Tab A 10,1\" ,  the screen resolution, vivid, perfect, sound quality A-mazing, battery life is ok, but the Wi-fi speed is cutting half speed when in landscape position ,so far that is my experience.",
            "Great Performance. Excellent, light and easy to use.",
            "I like the tablet and can recommend to a friend",
            "Very good service \nPrice good",
            "In my opinion its best tablet with really amazing sound, Dolby Atmos doing a great job. Perfect device for people who watching movies in tablet.",
            "This is the best affordable tablet on the market right now. I love it so much! \nThe graphics are great, sounds quality top notch and I love the fingerprint unlock and face recognition.\nI'm not a fan of apple products so was looking for an android tablet that was just as good but still affordable and after getting this tablet I can say it exceeded my expectations. 10/10 would recommend.",
            "I'm 49 and have always loved Samsung products . I finally bought my first ever tablet, so of course it too was Samsung. I LOVE this tablet, as a new user it was very easy to find my way around, though still learning new stuff daily. I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone looking for one. I've  just ordered the keyboard case in Hope's of using it like a mini laptop at home. My only wish is that it would have come with users manual to explain all it does or can do.Being a newbie tablet user that would have been great, but I'm  learning as I go along by simply using it.",
            "i thi k best for mubies games and music.best speakers with best quality screen.",
            "Pros:  good screen size.  Not too big and not too small.  Very good resolution.  Very stable software; no crashes after several months.  Very good sound. Satisfactory front and rear cameras\nCons:  I wish I bought the SIM version.",
            "This tablet is very light weight, so easy to handle, excellent graphics. Would definitely recommend this item to anyone. Still exploring what else I can do with it.",
            "It's a great tablet for the money, the display is sharp, the colours are vivid, and this version with 6GB of Ram is smooth as butter. In my opinion it worths the price tag. Sound is Loud and clear, battery life is good, 5 stars from me",
            "I replaced a tab s with the s5e, and am extremely pleasantly surprised, with the reduction in weight, increase in speed and overall performance.  Very happy with my purchase",
            "Nothing to say bad just good things",
            "Super fast 6gb ram 128gb",
            "Brilliant tablet, does everything i need it to do! I love it!",
            "Very thin new tablet. Very fast and easy to use. I'm used to Samsung it's second nature to use.",
            "Really happy with this as it's not only android but dex and linux ubuntu ! Cant wait to start tinkering with my iOT home kit via the linux terminal. Only downside is there is no keyboard cover with trackpad which is a must for using as a productivity device. Please please please Samsung make one for this device as you have the upcoming tab s6.",
            "Excellent but big drawback is that several times a day at random times switches the default keyboard from the chosen one to the Samsung one. If you can live with that then go for it. Sound quality is awesome!",
            "Awesome piece of kit... Display is just beautiful, there is no lag at all. Battery life is just great, I play a lot of online game at times 3 at the same time with all settings at max, which, on my old Tablet would only last about an hour, on here 2/3 hours. 4 Stars is because there is an issue with the Wi-Fi signal strength, depending where you hold the tablet affects the connection, It has never dropped as yet but it is irritating when your only several feet away from the hub.",
            "Great tablet! Really fast, does everything I need it to do!",
            "This has to be one of the devices you cant leave down it got everything  that you need loads of new things on it would recommend this to anyone pure class. ... dose need a case a.s.a.p",
            "After searching for weeks for a new tablet, I finally settled on this. I'm pleased I did! It's very fast, has lots of storage anf the media graphics are very good. Great tablet for allround use!",
            "i upgraded my ipad 9.7 2018 to this as i wanted more storage with this being able to take up to a 512gb card i was happy buy the tablet purchase a memory card where as some companys bigger storage means bigger price where you can choose the memory size by which card you purchase also the screen what can i say vivid 10.5 inch sAMOLED display is amazing best purchase by far",
            "I bought this tablet like 10 days ago, and Its great! Its fast does its job and it has a lot of storage and Ram. If you want a reliable tablet fast and with a great look. This one is the one, great job Samsung",
            "2 second audio delay while streaming anything to tv via cable.  So streaming anything is unwatchable.  (using official samsung dex cable fyi).  Also doesnt matter if it is in screen mirroring mode or dex mode.  Same audio delay with both.  You cant even pause video to get them back in sync.  It just stutters the video right from the get go.\nWaste of money",
            "In terms of battery and screen this tablet is great. In terms of Wifi connectivity it is terrible. i also own a Galaxy Tab S2 and have never had Wifi drop out in my house but with the S5e the signal drops all the time causing my streaming apps like Sky Go and Netflix to pause or crash. Very annoying as i expected this to have at least the same connectivity as my 4 year galaxy Tab S2. Also never realised there was no head phone jack with this product. Disappointed.",
            "I got this tablet just last week and it's been with me ever since. I can't just put it down! Amazing screen and features. Well done Samsung!",
            "It is very well made, study and feels expensive in the hand. No WiFi issues at all.... Perfect in everyway.",
            "Very good tablet very good sound however they should have considered to allow customers to purchase a pen like tab S4",
            "Bought this for the DeX feature. Samsung website says you can use USB-C to HDMI and I have a generic dock with keyboard monitor etc.  This worked with my last Android tablet and work PC but not with Samsung.  Screen comes on for about 5 seconds then disconnects,  a message pops up saying you have to use 'genuine Samsung accessories' to use DeX.  The screen comes on for a second s so it works, Samsung has just decided to lock it down to their own HDMI connectors.  \n\nShould say this up front, wouldn't have bought it if i had known.",
            "Just bought it for a week, including the keyboard cover, and totally satisfied, especially for the amazing AKG speakers, just a little bit pricey.",
            "I bought a couple of Tab S5e for company use. All the employees are complaining how bad the Wi-fi connection is. They have compared on same site/places with iOS devices 4 bar on iOS 0 on tab S5e. Please do not buy. I learnt the hardway.",
            "Bought this two months ago, was happy but now seriously hacked off, Settings, seems to reset every time you leave it for more than an hour, meaning the screen lock out defaults to 30 seconds as do the sound settings. Very irritating, rebooting or even a factory reset has no effect",
            "Very nice update, lighter faster and looks great. Colours on the screen are much brighter and the pictures are so much sharper, very much recommended.",
            "This is a great tablet, nice slim bezels, very slim design and lightweight which makes for a nice portable tablet. Not encountered any issues with speed or functionality of the OS and applications. Battery life is good and lasts me well. Would recommend.",
            "I've had the 126gb version four days and yes it looks really smart, and fantastic display and awesome sound, but it does lag loading webpages/Facebook etc.  The WiFi as others have said is poor, I can be sat in the same room not 6 ft from the router and the lag is terrible.  In other parts of the house I've WiFi repeaters, again this performs poorly compared to the Tab A 10.1 which seems to have much better WiFi.\n\nAnother issue I found while installing everything, if you've several items qued to download in the Google play store, they'll just hang and never download unless you clear the apps cache.  I think their is an issue in how this tablet functions, maybe it's the same problem for the WiFi as the signal strength looks good.",
            "Forget about Samsungs folding phones and just get instead this tablet! I mean the screen is mind blowing! Everything looks so crisp is unreal. Tablet in general runs very fast so far no problems at all. Battery life is as well top! My advice if you want big screen entertainment on the go... GET THIS TABLET!",
            "Very light for a 10 inch tablet, good screen, very good sound from the 4 corner speakers, performance OK. Battery life is reasonable but I miss the headphone jack. Really like the Dex mode with external keyboard/mouse and screen could almost replace a PC for web browsing.",
            "I bought this yesterday excellent delivery service the speakers are great well built overall good product Samsung A +  I'm very pleased with my new tab s5e good specs and good for watching movies",
            "Great oled screen and Dolby atmos sound, slim and light, like a small tv",
            "I've just moved up from the Tab S2 and to be quite honest, I'm unimpressed, underwhelmed and disappointed with the tablet.\n\nThe colours compared to the S2 are dull and lifeless and lack punch, the screen lacks sharpness and don't get me started about the Wifi network, I have a choice of 2.4G and 5G upstairs with repeaters and a Bt home hub 6 with repeaters downstairs and it can't pick up the home hub or 5G signal or repeaters from either network.",
            "Excellent value for money very nest",
            "This was for my wife to replace her old iPad. I have a more recent iPad and find that the Galaxy Tab 5E has a better screen, better speakers, a nicer interface and just feels better to use.",
            "Been waiting for Samsung to deliver a quality product that doesn't break the bank. Had been stuck with an S2 for a long while as I wasn't prepared to pay the (in my opinion) exorbitant increase in price for an S3 or S4. I'm certainly not disappointed in the S5e it gives me everything that I need in a tablet. Speed is good, battery life excellent and display out of this world.",
            "i read the reviews before purchasing this. i do really like it but every app seems to have trouble loading nd its not due to the wifi because my phone (note 9) and laptop has no trouble loading on wifi i tried even disconnecting my phone with no luck. Also the wifi is definitely a problem in your left hand it has disconnected several times and also drops in connectin at times due in my hand please find a solution whether this is a case or something else. Currently you dont even offer a case to purchase! if these 2 problems were sorted i would absolutely love it but until then i cant recommend it over other tablets.",
            "Crashed within the hour, thinking it is a software problem, trieded to update the firmware only to be told, your current software version isn't supported, visit a service centre. WOW, this is a brand new tablet that will be going back and will stick with what i know works.",
            "Wifi stops working when you have your hand holding the corner of the tablet .",
            ".... yes there are many tablets out there that are cheaper , but inevitably you end up replacing them quicker for better ones\nScreen is crisp & bright , speakers are very immersive & great for watching streaming movies , large 125gb internal memory is welcome as apps get bigger,\nBattery is lasting over 10 hours use and the charge time quick\nFinger print scanner in the on button I though would be just a gimmick , but very useful when using banking ect.\nIt's new so new cases are sparse",
            "There was no headphone jack! \nAnd the bluetooth stays on even though it is in standby mode.\nAnd it is full of annoying bloatware that confuses the bleep out of you and which generates tons of annoying notifications every 30 seconds.\nCome on Samsung, what the dickens are you playing at, copying some of apple's most annoying and hated features? \nAnd no cover or type cover at launch? You might not care, but the type cover for the Tab s4 is so terrible some of us want to know what we are in for.\nAnd of course the s pen from note 8 doesnt work on it. I mean why would it? It's not like it is a good idea to have some form of cross compatibility. No, much better to act like every product you make is new and incompatible with each other.\nAnyone would think your company is full of people who don't talk to each other or really care about customers.",
            "If you're after a tablet with decent specs and performance for a reasonable price then this tablet fits the bill.\n\nI have been using it for nearly 2 weeks and overall quite satisfied. It is ridiculously thin, is light and the bezel is spot on.  Battery life is good and with moderate use I've easily had 2 days without a recharge.  I thought I would try the S Pen from my previous Galaxy tablet but it isn't recognised, sadly.\n\nI do however have a few minor gripes I think people should be aware of...\n- There are still no accessories available in the UK since launch, leaving me to rely on 3rd party generic ones, such as a cover.  \n- When viewing in landscape there's no option to swap the volume buttons, so they appear to be working backwards.\n- The home screen grid size is stupidly small (6x5 blocks) with no option to change it. This means adding a calendar widget literally takes up half the screen!\n- WiFi is a little slower (around 200Mbs) compared to my S9 but is only noticeable when testing download speeds.\n- Lastly, considering this is an OLED screen, fast scrolling vertically in any app causes a very slight and strange 'wobble' effect, as if the left side is always catching up with the right. It can be a little distracting but otherwise the screen is brilliant and doesn't have any issues with fast motion in games or video.\n\nIssues assure, you gets decent tablet for the price. Performance is solid and the Dex environment has a lot of potential. The camera is 'OK' and will be fine for most.",
            "This tablet has an amazing screen and amazing speakers.  Spot on for movies.  I got the one with more storage as it comes with 6gb of ram as well not 4gb must have if you watch a lot of movies and YouTube",
            "This all seems Fantastic but I would like to know if this tablet supports the use of a pencil",
            "Had it a couple of weeks, fantastic product! Great battery life, screen is PERFECT and the small bezels only add to the immersive experience. \n\nOne criticism is that the volume buttons aren't reversed when in landscape (so they are the wrong way round in landscape) - which is annoying when watching media which you definitely want to do with this screen! Buttons are all on the same side so it makes sense to rotate the tab to landscape button side up.",
            "I already had a samsung galaxy tab s2 loaded with apps and music. Really appreciated smart switch which copied everything onto the new tablet. Will not take it anywhere until i can get a cover as it is very thin. Would have preffered a gold colour finish, would have liked a cover similar to the studs on the s2. It has been very easy to get going, facial recognition not working well at moment but fingerprint working well.",
            "Got the 128 GB Model , and impressed up to now , quick , smooth, good sound , lots of my apps downloaded onto it show \"not optimised for this device\" but I guess that's what happens when the device is new to the market.\nTried with the 256gb card as I have many pictures ( will be using this tablet mostly for editing when away from home) and transfer rates are good.\n\nThe only thing that I have noticed is the thinner bezel around the screen means my pudgy fingers often activate the screen touch sensors unintentionally, but I'll adapt.\n\nCharge time quick , and initial usage appears to show this unit is going to have a long battery life\n\nAlso with this being brand new there is a lack of accessories cases ect.",
            "Had my tab5 a few days now and overall very pleased with it. The screen is excellent. Quad speakers very nice of course the output quality is dependent upon the input broadcast quality so I haven't experienced it at it's best yet. Nice light table very quick from startup and opening and closing applications. Lots of features yet to explore. I haven't  found much to criticise, two small issues are, no covers available yet to protect my valuable piece of equipment and the overall finish is very smooth so you are in danger of inadvertently dropping it. Also using the tab without a cover is awkward because the screen comes so close to the edge it's difficult to keep your fingers clear of the screen. However very pleased with my purchase.",
            "Arrived the Saturday of the Easter weekend and writing review late Easter Monday.  Arrived charged up and then spent a few painless hours flicking back and forth letting the tab s5e complete a mirror installation from my s9plus.  Only used for web browsing via chrome and YouTube awesome display, speakers dont seem much louder than s9plus but quickly went to headset that was delivered with the s9plus via the c-usb adapter that comes with the s5e no headset included.  Easter Sunday it wouldn't turn on and had to complete a reset holding vol and off key for about 16 sec.  Spent about an hour over the day using again impressed with the display. Easter Monday started using for YouTube and screen went blank after 10 minutes again wouldn't come on and completed a vol and power reset and this time it rebooted in safe mode followed by me completing reset in normal.  \nIt's great but obviously there is some teething problems.  It seems Samsung didnt push out the size to the case manufacturer's as trying to get a case from otterbox, lifeproof or zagg or any of the copy companies is currently not possible.",
            "First impressions after two days use are that this is a great value for money product with good performance for day to day use. I’ve had no issues with consuming video, multiple tab browsing on chrome and other general apps from the play store. I’m running this tablet side by side with my iPad 12.9 and the display is comparable although obviously smaller however the colours are in my opinion slightly better and sharper. Next step is to get the micro sod card and storage will never be an issue in the future.\nIn short. For 379 gbp it’s incredible value for money and well worth the purchase. It’s a shame that on release date there are no cases available on Samsung’s website as the tablet should definitely be protected against bumps and scratches. I’m using the tablet for my daily commute and won’t be travelling with it until I do have a case",
            "Pre ordered this tablet and was looking forward to receiving it. The day finally came and wow nice piece of kit. But after just 2 or 3 hours of use it was knackered."
