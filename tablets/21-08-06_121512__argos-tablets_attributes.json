There is a lot of stuttering, hanging and freezing, it also turns off sometimes, so my son has lost his school work a few times.

Sadly this is not.\nI can only give this 2 out of 10.",

My wife and I have always liked Lenovo as a make and this is no exception.\nDisplay, speed, memory, charge time, ease of use is all good when you consider the price I doubt it could be bettered. The only disappointment is there is the connection for a charge dock on the side but I have not been able to find one to buy anywhere.",

I keep a lot of photos so rather than paying 100 quid more for 64gb, I simply purchased an SD card for 7.99 - you can't go wrong! It's a replacement for my 16gb Lenovo, four years old, which was about the same price but doesn't hold a charge so well now.  Gamers might look elsewhere of course but for everyday stuff, it's a bargain.",

Only one downside is that I find the sound is not loud enough but you can easily add a bluetooth speaker if needed. The battery life is ok, maybe 3-4 hours use of video calling before it needs charging. However, overall I am impressed with the tablet and it is certainly excellent value for money.",

The price was excellent and the performance is great for streaming. It's easy to set up and use. Battery life isn't bad for the price. The charging cable is quite short though. It has the connectors to enable it to be charged on a charging dock, which you'd have to buy separately. Overall, a great tablet for a good price.",

I used it maybe an hour or so a day for a week before needing to recharge. The screen is perfect for watching catch-up or films and the dual front speakers give great sound quality. I didn't find any lag whilst using the tablet, everything seems to run smoothly with the hardware it has.",
            "Lenovo M10 tablet is light in weight, has a good 10inch HD screen with good graphics great for watching a movie or favourite series. Tablet has dual front-facing speakers which is very noticeable good sound quality. Set-up took less than 2 minutes which has face recognition, multiple user access, and great child friendly mode. Camera isn’t bad at 5mp and a 2mp front facing, Installed memory of 32GB is more than enough for saving my photos and videos.",

Makes accessing Google classroom for us with current home learning simple. \nVery easy to add apps. Works with speed across the board.\nBattery life is Amazing, Min 3 days+ general use. \nCon: I did notice the WiFi doesn't connect as far outside to our caravan where as our other branded tablet does. \nThe volume + on/off button feel very close together.",
            "The tablet is light and well presented, unfortunately that's all that's good about it. The colours on screen are very dull,even when you crank up the display options. It's also not the easiest to use, closing apps can be a bit off a nightmare. The processor also seems substandard, games are jumpy and freeze on you quite regularly. I've given this to my son as he likes to use it for YouTube.  If you want a tablet that a good starting point then I would say stay away from this one.",

            "This is an great little tablet for the money. The screen is a good size & it has all the features you need. If your only using it for browsing the Internet, online shopping or as a tablet for your children then it's perfect. If you use a tablet quite alot & rely on one then I don't think this is the one for you. It's quite slow & takes a bit of patience to operate. Stylish design & lightweight, good handbag/manbag size for commuters! Battery lasts a good few days too!",
            "The Lenovo tablet arrived in a very expensive looking package. It compared very well with the packaging of more expensive tablets. I have used the tablet for two weeks and given it a thorough testing in the house and outside in the garden. In the house was an easy test, connecting to Bluetooth and WiFi speedily and trouble free. Outside in the garden really surprised me, the picture quality and clarity in the sunshine was excellent! \nI would definitely recommend this tablet to everyone!",

            "Surprised at how light the tablet was for its size. Setting up the device was very easy. Not the quickest but for what I'd say is a mid entry, its quick enough for every day use. Quick downloading and opening apps and when multitasking or playing games which take up the processing power, it does copes quite well. Good quality HD screen and have no issues at watching a movie or playing games. Sound quality is also very good with Dolby Audio gives it a much better user experience.",
            "I got my husband to do setup as he is not very tech challenged, he did it all ok without help. He said it gave clear instructions and was easy to understand.  It surprised me that it has face recognition and it’s very quick even at different angles and light. After a full Charge it lasted for ages when surfing and FB.  Easy to load films as memory is expandable via micro card. Screen ok in most light except bright sunlight.  Overall looks good and works well great value for money",

            "This was my first time using the Lenovo brand and it works well.  It was easy to set up but for some reason after a day of using it the automatic screen rotation stopped working I had to troubleshoot online and I managed to fix the problem but it meant having to reset the tablet and start over again which wasn't ideal.  The tablet itself is lightweight, the graphics & battery life are good and I've had enough storage for all my usual apps etc overall it's a good tablet but not quite a great one",
            "This Lenovo tablet is great, it's a really good size. Sometimes they can be a bit small but this is good, easily fits in your bag.\n\nThis was so easy to set up, I'm not very tech savvy and I followed the steps very easily in minutes I was using it.\n\nThe camera takes great photos, really sharp and bright.",
            "Had a good test of this great tablet, Easy to set up pretty good battery life only downside is charging time, works great for conference calls using certain app's also has a great camera for photos and videos, the expandable memory is a great feature, the graphics when using for games is really good and very clear, I especially like the child profiles so kids are limited as to what they can access, i would recommend this tablet over some more expensive well known brands.",
            "This is a great tablet if you are looking for a solid piece of kit for a lot less money than other well known brands.\nIf you are familiar with  Android systems, then this tablet will work well for you, and essentially works just like your Android phone but on a larger scale.\nYou are able to put a SIM in the tablet too should you want to.\nThe operating speed is okay. And if you just want a tablet for  browsing the internet, going on facebook etc then this is great.\nHas a kids mode on it too",
            "The Lenovo M10 Tab HD 32gb first impression is light and looks good. It was really easy and quick to set up through Google Drive sharing documents and photos  from my IOS account. Sound quality from YouTube is very good and clear. Volume was decent but it would of benefited from being a little louder. The usual social media apps (Instagram, Snap Chat, TikTok) worked great but this is expected. Roblox also worked good however a little laggy at times on this game. Good quality pictures.",
            "Smooth running, loads quickly, responds fast. Slim and lightweight so easy to hold even with having a large screen. Graphics are beautiful and bright! Sound is amazing, clear and loud due to the dual front speakers. I love how you can add a child’s account with restrictions so there’s no worry about what they are going on, and add multiple other users so very family friendly being able to each have our own account. Can add a keyboard to aid homework. Small downside it shows every fingerprint"
