Long battery life, great camera, and \"punches above its weight\" appears frequently in tests. Looking forward to using it! Had to buy a serious cover though. Not available at Argos or john Lewis, paid big bucks at Samsung.",

No facial recognition option.\nPoor cameras, unacceptable for the price range and coming from a manufacturer such as Samsung.\nGreat speakers, boosted by Dolby.\nNot including a case or screen protector is the norm but I just don't understand why.\nExpensive compared to a similar performance phone, but the tablet market is just stuck arm.",

            "Just love this tablet for the HD sharpness of the screen and the performance of the tablet I can't fault it really apart from one thing. The charging port is also used for an adapter to put in, you then put your headphones into this to use them. It is a pain if you want to use your headphones and you need to charge your tablet at the same time as you can't do this. Apart from this I love the ease of using it, how light it is and very portable to carry with you. I still recommend this tablet",
            "This Samsung tablet is excellent. The screen is pin sharp, it's oled not tnt, simple to use and very light to hold, battery life is brilliant. I like the dual speaker stereo sound coming out of this tablet! Nuf said. Would have got the s6e, but went for the s5e instead. I know I'm missing the stylus pen, But it does connect to a keyboard with case combined together sold separately. I'm very happy with my purchase!! Great buy.",

Fantastic colours even the SD images look like HD. Great for Web browsing as well and if and when I do some work, its got that covered too! Best of all on this tablet is battery life. Running full on for two days I've still got 25% left. That takes some beating. My only niggle is the short charging cable. Cmon Samsung get it sorted!",

The tablet Snapdragon processor makes the tab quick when performing tasks. The screen resolution is equally as good. One surprise wasthe tab has 4 speakers giving it an exceptional sound for a tablet. If you really want a tab with the S-Pen then go for the S6 Lite (a good tab, but not packing the superior snapdragon processor), but if you want performance then this is tab for you.",

It's a bit smaller than  the previous one but I've got used to that quickly .  It was really easy to set up and customise. The charger is not interchangeable with chargers for other devices and there is  no separate headphone jack.  However, there's a dongle which fits into the only port  and you can plug headphones into that.",

Sadly this beauty keeps dropping its WIFI connection, something that never ever happened with my Tab S!! and you Smartswitch is not as smart as it used to be, having used it before many times on all our phones.",
            "In short, this tablet is not as good as my old tabs. Even as I write this it is freezing up but the main issue is that it will not always connect to the internet.  My husband, who has taken over my old tablet, can be sitting next to me and he can connect to the internet but I can't.  I don't like the smaller keyboard either. If my old tablet had not started to lose its charge quickly I would not have changed.",

We now have two Samsung S5e's, the only problem is that they don't automatic reconnect to my home internet when they are turned on. We don't have the same problem with our Samsung old tablet and mobile phones.",
            "The tablet is absolutely amazing very useful and simple to use, i can't complain to be honest, very well made and the sound is just spectacular, well done samsung you've to be proud of your products.",
            "omg the sound on this tablet just blew me away it takes watching films or listening to music to a whole new level. The tablet is like using my s10e i can make calls receive calls I have used it every day since I got it was using A fire 10 before which I have now given to my son.",
            "I loved my tablet when I first got it.  However after a recent update it continually freezes or the UI stops working.  It's only good for throwing across the room these days.",
            "speed and the picture/screen quality is amazing!!!",
            "Certain Apps open in Portrait while others open in Landscape and switch to portrait in certain features even though I have disabled screen rotation.  Pictures and some facebook images open far too large even though settings are minimal. Won't let me install banking, displays an error code that Samsung inform me doesn't exist! \nSound quality is excellent, battery life is average, kind of wish I had stuck with iPad though!",
            "the WiFi is disappointing, it is very insensitive and if you hold it the wrong way you can completely  block the signal from reaching the antenna.\nNow with the upgrade to Android 10 a bug has been introduced which means that every time you power it up (every day in my case) you have to turn the WiFi off and then on again before it will connect to any of your saved networks.",
            "I have a Samsung phone and have always found them very good. \nSo after having a ipad for a few years decided to invest in the Samsung  S5E .\nI am very disappointed in this tablet . When starting the tablet up I have to manually turn off the WiFi on the tablet and then turn it on again before it will connect. It often freezes, and can be slow to load pages. \nI have  very fast wifi and have no issues with any other devices that are used in my household. \nIn future I will stick with an ipad when purchasing a tablet.",
            "Love my tablet.  Its slim and easy to use . Great screen , very crisp and clear.  \nMy only quibble is no earphone socket so I couldn't take it to use when in hospital recently .",
            "Not as good as I expected, very slow and slow to respond, came from an ipad and when I change again will go back to apple, as their performance is far better than this tablet",
            "Great ,no photo bot its quality is good. Love it.bye.",
            "I find it easy to use and this is my second Samsung tablet . I am not a tech savvy person but find this presents no problem  for me surfing the Internet.",
            "Love it, so much quicker than my laptop. Great size and so easy to use.",
            "The tab his fantastic and its take wonderful picture the best",
            "An absolutely fantastic well made small tablet, coupled with the keyboard folio it's absolutely bang on, I did have some concerns over the processor and ram being up to the job as I use the device for work and some of the software we use can be pretty heavy duty but it manages it extremely well.",
            "I love Samsung devices and tablets!  I have had a Samsung S series from the S4.  I still have an S6, S8, S9, S10, S10 Plus, Tab S, Tab S5e!  I'm a Samsung fan for the design, the One.UI (the best OS), the fluidity and the eco system!  The photographic sector always at the top!  The only drawback the battery, not up to the competitors!",
            "I own tab A 10.5 and I wanted the s5e as its more lighter and nicer display. I like the fingerprint  scanner which always  works first time. It has amazed me.   Its a beautiful tablet and its a pleasure  to  watch  movies on it and listening to  music. Now its got upgraded to 2.1 which makes it run smoothly.  So all in all im happy I bought this tablet.",
            "Investment. Superb build / feel / quality. OLED pin sharp screen. Fast, long lasting microchip. 64 Gb ssd storage & I put in a 128 Gb micro sd card. Fingerprint scanner. I mainly use it for games and reading. Use Xbox game pass & NVIDIA GeForce Now cloud gaming. I use this tablet everyday and haven’t used my gaming laptop for ages. Fast screen, which is glorious in every way possible. The best screen out there. The Samsung user interface is clever, fast and rewarding. This tablet should of been more expensive, I feel guilty that I had such an amazing buy. Don’t use my shield gaming tablet anymore as I have this. Secure, reliable, fast and soo light. Battery is amazing and charges almost instantly. Always wanted this make and spec, but now I have it due to the price being affordable. This is my one stop for all and I bought a leather case and Bluetooth rechargeable pen. Hurry while stocks last. OLED all the way. Samsung is now my brand and I’m not going anywhere else in future. Flawless. Respect where it is due. Unbeatable",
            "It has 4 speakers which I love because I am a little bit harder hearing and yet I can hear the Sound out of the speakers The fingerprint and the  Code is very useful  The only downside for me is there's no Jack Headphone Jack I knew will need to buy a cover for it a bit slippery in your hands",
            "Good Battery life easily lasts for a full day, fast and responsive touch screen",
            "I bought  a tablet for games a few days ago.\nThat is the best present I've made to myself , apart from the car.\nIt works beautifully.  \nWould never imagine use anything else than Samsung. \nThe best phones , tablets,  and I'm looking for a tv now.\nI hope my wife doesn't object  ( she will not) :):):):)",
            "It's a fantastic, tablet. Great sounds and very light to hold. The display is great good battery  life.  I love watching Netflix and YouTube videos.",
            "Glorified phone that is out of date and does not function as a tablet as the ipad does and does not work as a PC in DEX mode.",
            "Ordered on line at 11.00am and picked it up at 4.00pm from local Sainsbury. Couldn’t fault service. Would highly recommend Argos and will use them again.",
            "My new Samsung tablet is great, much quicker to respond than my old tablet or even my laptop. It takes much better photos and is easier to use.",
            "Excellent performance except for face recognition, and fingerprint recognition not that great either. Light and strong but feels vulnerable to dropping so i got a case.",
            "Everything other than wifi is fine. If it doesn't stop dropping the internet it will be going back.",
            "Great product \nAmold screen..good size.\nSlim design\nPortable.\nReplacingmy old apple..",
            "good quality product, i like it.\nrecomend",
            "The tablet is great, fast and full of tools and it feels polished as most Samsung android based products are. Typically android apps have less quality over other operating systems and this was a factor for me. Many apps are awesome but many are not. What I like about Samsung is they have they're own galaxy store that has curated apps. The only technical issue I'm not keen on is the face identifier as it fails more than it should so I use finger print instead and that works great.",
            "Pleasantly surprised how good this tablet is. UI is clear and very responsive. So much better than my previous tablet (but it did cost quite a lot more).",
            "This Samsung tablet is excellent, I would highly recommend it to anyone. Its very light and I do prefer to have a cover on it.The photos are great and it was easy to transfer everything I needed to from my old one",
            "Not much to be honest",
            "Excellent screen and fast updates - much better than the TAB3.",
            "Excellent value, clear screen, good sound...",
            "Nor certified on Google Play Store so can't use Netflix and Disney+ rendered the tablet not fit for purpose",
            "Only con is the screen is not as good as I expected in sunlight.",
            "The tablet is very light and thin, which may not be suitable for those who aren't careful with their devices. If you'd like to buy the corresponding keyboard case it's over 1/3 of the price of the tablet which seems excessive. The tablet is fast, as is the side mounted fingerprint sensor. The tablet is extremely attractive, with slim borders are a matte metal design which makes it appear more premium than it is. The camera is of low quality, but not really the intended and common use of a tablet. The tablet handles high graphics games well and doesn't overheat. The battery life of course depends on usage, with heavy usage lasting easily 12 hours. Overall a good mid-range tablet, which is relatively affordable. Would definitely recommend. Review after 6 months of usage, little battery deterioration, nor scratches to the screen or body of tablet. Tablet stills runs smootly",
            "Great tablet ,sound is exceptional  with four speakers ,quality is very good as is the price,slim and light weight .camera is really good to fast charging battery was for a long time .",
            "Tablet came pre charged so was able to set up straight away which was a breeze.\nScreen us chrystal clear an the colours are bright and punchy.\nBooks and magazines are really easy to read and games look incredible.\nAdded memory card which again was really easy to do.\nReally can't fault the tablet ants so thin and light that your arms don't ache after extended use,.\nGo get one.",
            "Was choosing between this and the newer S6 Lite. I chose the S5E because of the brilliant AMOLED screen. It also has 4 loudspeakers, allowing it to be used upright or in landscape format with great sound. The fingerprint sensor works very well too.\n\nA bit heavier than I expected, and I did need to get a case both for protection and because it is quite slippery, easily dropped if not in a case.",
            "Its good and very easy to use.and its very simple",
            "Needed a new tablet and very pleased with this.Good size screen,great pictures and sound.Nice and easy to use ,2 year warranty from Samsung and easy to transfer storage from another device using micro sim storage card.",
            "only had about 2 weeks. But so far everything I want an more. Only 1 down side you have to pay for Microsoft word. I was looking at getting the s6 lite but after a lot of research It worked out better faster an cheaper then the s6 lite. So if your after a very good all singing all dancing tablet then save a bundle get the s5e. Unless you want the pen",
            "A really good tablet with excellent sound and picture quality. Syncs easily with other Samsung products. Good for watching  films, etc, particularly when used on a stand. Very pleased.",
            "Great little tablet for the money. I bought it as my eye sight is getting worse. It's great to turn brightness up and increase the text. Battery life is great.Forgot to order a glass screen so if you are going to buy a tablet, buy a glass screen as well.",
            "I am so pleased with my tablet this replaces my previous  tablet which was a Bush I highly recommend  my new purchase",
            "Lovely tablet very light",
            "have not come across any dont yet, love the tablet",
            "This Item is a replacement for my tab 3 . I love this new one as it does a lot more and I’ve not put it down since had and battery works very well for 14 hours I’ve had mine for 3 months now",
            "The tablet is very light and thin starts up very quickly and goes on to apps fast and Downloads quick (with my internet) and sound and pitchers are excellent",
            "Good product, delivered quickly.",
            "Great tablet, suits our needs perfectly",
            "I LOVE THIS ITS MY THIRED SO THAT SPEACKS FOR ITS SELF",
            "I purchased this for the display because I do alot of filming in 4k, and thought it would be good to show the film's,  I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the tablet, the quad speakers are amazing for such a small device,  my only gripe was there's no slow motion mode on the camera, on saying that the rear camera does film 4k. I'd highly recommend this to anyone.",
            "Great! It look's good, move fast!",
            "This is by far one of the best tablets out there the picture quality is fantastic for movies",
            "Fabulous product, great slimline design and fast.",
            "Great piece of kit \nIdeal replacement for an older model....glad I chose this one",
            "Great size screen with good quality sound .very easy to set up",
            "It's an amazing experience and big jump from Samsung note 8 to s5e but when campare with s6 you get much more in same price or little mre",
            "I BOUGHT THIS TABLET FOR MY WIFE, AND  SHE LOVES IT. I WISH I HAD BOUGHT IT FOR MYSELF, AS MY TABLET IS GETTING A BIT OLD IN THE TOOTH. YOURS A JEALOUS HUSBAND.",
            "Best option for mid range tab, other (newer) version out has pen but revues prior to buying is only get if you need the pen as this model is better at everything else.  Finding it a dream to use, easy to set up and the form and screen are to die for. I totally recommend.",
            "I purchased this tablet to replace an older Samsung model.\nThe selling point to me was the amazing AMOLED screen and the quad speakers. I use my tablet mainly for watching movies and box sets etc when I am away from home for work. This tablet does not disappoint. Its not the most powerful, but its still very smooth and can deal with everything I need it to do. For the price you will struggle to find a better one",
            "Fantastic. Battery life lasts for ages.  Would highly recommend",
            "A lovely tablet. Beautiful screen and performs great.\nRecommended for those who wont be seduced by the fruit lemmings!",
            "I replaced my old tablet for this one as the sound quality was bad on my old one this is much better.\nI love it.",
            "This is a great tablet, lovely big screen and compared to my older tablet, it's really fast. Very good sound. I like it so much I have recommended it to friends who have bought one for themselves. One of the amazing things about this tablet is the speed in which the battery is charged. It is very slim, and before my case arrived, it did slip out of my hands a few times. It's better in a case.  Overall I'm very impressed with this tablet.",
            "Arrived on time, charged quickly. Works well.",
            "The best tablet ever",
            "Well apart from that lower end processor against other tablets and iPads for that price mark it is good table, Samsung screen doesn't disappoint they great or one of the best in the market. I don't really play games on it but it capable of handling just fine, I use it mostly for streaming it gets the job done just fine, sound quality on it great with the Dolby Atmos.\nIf you want android tablet and don't need a pen then this is worth it but I wish they had better processor.",
            "No regrets this 8s a lovely tablet",
            "For me this product has an excellent performance, very fast when downloading any images. It's brilliant!",
            "Love Samsung tablet s5e\nFast and easy to use.",
            "My tab looks super and works fantastic.\nI loved it .",
            "It's great but a bit heavy so you need to rest it on something rather than hold it if using more than a short period.",
            "Quality tablet and really fast.",
            "An unbelievable thin yet strong and great looking tablet. Very fast and long Battery life. Fully charged in 150 minutes. Buy it you will not be disappointed.",
            "We have found the tablet easy to set up, easy to use and responds very quickly.\nThe battery life is also very good. Would recommend.",
            "Great looking and pretty fast.good screen and perfect for reading books.Sound is great too.Great price and service from Argos.",
            "After watching many on line reviews and checking feedback for this tablet I can confirm the screen is fabulous great colour and very sharp the sound from the 4 speakers is unbelievably good the stereo is the best I have ever had compared my to old fruit flavoured device it has no problem playing hd video from any source I'm an avid YouTube viewer I tend to watch up to 6 hours per day plus Facebook and Netflix so after testing this tablet I can say I get 11 hours per charge a great experience",
            "Best value for your money, great performance. This Samsung tablet is reliable, light and perfect for study and game.",
            "This is the best tablet I have ever had. Battery life is amazing.",
            "This tablet everything I would want,  quality pictures  and clear vision of everything\non the screen, battery good so far  in fact everything good",
            "Purchased it as a replacement for my old Samsung tablet which was great, 5 years old never failed. New one is even better, hope it lasts as long, now doubt it will.\nRecommend.",
            "Good:\n- Amazing hd quality screen.\n- Extremely light weight.\n- looks amazing \n- has same features and runs aswell as an iPad Pro and looks almost identical. And for a quarter of the price!!\n- very secure device. (Face ID/Pattern/passcode)\n\nDefinitely recommend to anyone",
            "It is no use if you want to download anything from Google Store, for example, any non-right wing newspaper apps, WhatsApp, eBay app etc. Lots of Amazon adds, but I guess that's to be expected.\n\nIt does what it does well, I just wish it was more versatile.",
            "Wouldn\"t buy any other",
            "Very impressed with Argos delivery, package arrived on time. Very pleased with the product, easily managed to set up. Updated from an older model, and would recommend.",
            "Great product.Easy to use.",
            "An excellent tablet, with top quality image and good performance. It's very (very) slim and light. Definitely need a cover to use this easily (but don't buy the very expensive Samsung version. There are some excellent alternatives available for much less). Overall, excellent.",
            "GREAT Cost and Performance\n\nLooks and feels better than the pictures",
            "Great screen and fast but wifi problems take the shine off.",
            "The best tablet ever",
            "Fast reliable service. Tablet was well packaged and I managed to get it working fairly easily.",
            "This is a great looking tablet, with a fantastic screen and excellent sound quality (although make sure you enable Dolby Atmos in the settings to get the most out of the four speakers).\nI didn't need the S Pen features on the Tab S6 at £200 more expensive, and the additional screen resolution and additional two speakers on this device are worth the upgrade from the 10.1 tablet.\nBattery life lasts me two days and I use it a lot for videos, music, and browsing.",
            "Incredible, razor-sharp picture quality but mine suffers badly from what is called the amoled jelly effect.  The screen drags lopsided when scrolling in portrait mode (doesnt happen in landscape) making the text wobble. Not sure if it's just my copy or the same for all.  Other than that, it's brilliant.",
            "A first class fast tablet. i brought this for my wife because her last tablet was taking hours to charge, it charges quickly, lasts around 10 hours use between tablets ( ive not actually timed it but it lasts at least all day and through to the next. screen is clear and crisp and being a Samsung it matches in operation to her phone so works exactly as you would expect, All in all a premium tablet.",
            "Nice to use lovely size screen",
            "Really pleased with this tablet. It's exactly what I needed.",
            "Got this for my mum whilst she is in lockdown and hoping she will also find it easy to use! Brilliant graphics and camera.",
            "One of the best tablets I've experienced, as good as iPad. Minor issue when too far from the Wifi but problem minimal for to be rated an annoyance",
            "Nice to handle. Good value. Disappointing network speed - my other android devices connect at 800 plus but this tablet seldom beats 292",
            "Love everything about this tablet",
            "Great tablet, great performance and build quality. Video and sound quality is 10/10 and battery life is great you can easily stream a complete film without have to stop and recharge. \nOverall great product well worth the price the only thing that I noticed and was quite annoying in my opinion was, it doesn't have a headphone jack but Samsung helped this problem by providing an adapter with the price so can't complain.",
            "Very useful and practicable. My kids love it.",
            "Great purchase to replace old Samsung 10.1. This is slimmer, faster, sharper images and easy to set up all my favourite apps. Lots of storage with option for sd card too. Charge lasts what seems like days. I have bought a keyboard case that make it look and act like a laptop. So pleased I bought this.",
            "I bought it for my other half she loves it",
            "Perfect size and weight, \nEasy to use and set up",
            "It's a brilliant tablet, very quick, easy to use, gorgeous screen....but mine still hasn't been updated (Security Updates) since January 1st! The latest so far is April 1st 2020, that's not acceptable, but if you can see past that important issue, then go for it, you won't be disappointed.",
            "Good quality mid range/size tablet, easy to set up and use. Love the screen quality for photos etc.",
            "Exactly what expected so I have bought second one.\nGood price especially with £50 cash back directly from Samsung which was easy  to submit.\nTablet look and works good.\nHighly recommend.",
            "Argos website asked when I want it delivered and there were delivery time slots for next day, so it arrived in less than 24hours of ordering. I have used it mainly for emails, video calls and games so far but have set up Microsoft office on it so can use for my studies when I return back to university. It is very quick, the battery lasts ages. Overall love this product and great price too.",
            "Bought for my 16 year old son to do his homework. \"It's good stuff\", he said, which is praise indeed from him!",
            "Good buy havent found any negatives very happy with purchase",
            "Loved the tab. The tab is slim and easy to handle. The display is fine and the sound clarity is fantastic.",
            "So far so good,  this is a great tablet that does everything we need it to. Easy to set up and use.",
            "Been a PC laptop user since early 90s. Hardly use it at all now except for complex docs etc. This Tab is far more suitable for most things on a day to day basis.",
            "-well designed\n-light weight\n-great resolution\n-good value for money",
            "This tablet is fine for everyday use, screen quality is great. Would recommend a screen protector & decent cover as can easily slip out of hands.",
            "It’s best product at the price they are offering for..excellent sound,grt battery performance..",
            "Bought this to upgrade from my previous Sansung tablet. Much quicker and easier to navigate. \nOnly down side for me is the on/off button. I find it quite hard to use",
            "Upgraded from my previous Samsung tablet, which I was more than happy with but had had for a couple of years.  This one works better, faster, smoother, bigger screen, better quality screen and looks the biz!  I recommend purchasing a case to protect it.  A must have really if you drop it as much as I do!",
            "This is a very good tablet for the price. Although the processor is a little underpowered for gaming and running multiple apps (although I haven't found it a problem as it still runs smoothly) this tablet, with its excellent screen, 4 speakers with Dolby Atmos, and excellent battery life, excels at video playback. It lacks the S Pen found on the higher spec (and double the price ) S6, but if you don't mind that, this is an excellent choice of tablet.",
            "Very light, enjoy using it",
            "Needed an upgrade for my tablet. Was going to go for a smaller cheaper one, but the display on this tablet looks great.\n\nLots of very handy features like being able to receive calls and texts on the tablet if you don't have your phone handy.",
            "Only had it for a short time, but it blows me away. Its very thin and it is lightweight which ticks the main box in terms of my requirements. I travel a lot and I try and travel light. Lugging a laptop with me has basically driven me nuts. This S5e solves that problem once and for all. Plus I'm \"old\" and my eyesight and hearing is not the best! This display is bight and because of the OLED black is black, text is just so easy to read. As for the sound, it is far the best on any device I own so clear and bright.\n\nFor work I use Office 365, which is well supported in Android and I can easily acomplish all of my daily tasks with this device. For relaxation, I listen to music, watch video's and play the odd easy game. This device has the potential to be one of the few, best devices I have ever purchased. I don't say that lightly as the only other device that has rightly achived that acolade is my Delongi ECAM bean to cup machine!",
            "Compared to the higher-spec s6 the 5e was perfect for me. It has good performance and great battery life, it just lacks the s-pen. If you are a pen user then the extra couple of hundred quid might be worth it. I also prefer the fingerprint sensor in the power button, a far more sensible placement than forcing you to stick your fingers on the screen which is the current dumb design norm.",
            "This tablet is slim and light, and was very easy to set up. Account, file & app sync, face & fingerprint unlocks all done in a jiffy. There is no headphone jack but it connected to my wireless earphones no problem. The display is bright and clear although I am not using it for anything hardcore, but it's fine for web, kindle, email, games etc. The battery lasts about a day give or take. There is minimal pre-installed bloatware, hooray! And plenty of el cheapo cases & keyboards online if needed.",
            "This was to replace an ageing I pad which was no longer upgradeable. for my purposes it works well, surfing the net looking at videos and reading. Battery life is good and the screen is very clear with bright colours.\nQuick response and light and convenient to hold. I also found a good choice of covers/ protectors is available for this model without the need to resort to the expensive Samsung one.",
            "Best tablet I've had",
            "I've had this for about 6 months. It is very good for media consumption but that is it. Want to do brousing on the internet or edit a word document and it struggles, slows and lags around. This tablet has so much potential with a rubbish processor so is just slowed and stops the use of the amazing screen in games or just day to day internet usage. Do not buy this I would think that the S6 would be way better just because of the better processor.",
            "Amazing tablet. Worth every penny",
            "Sending this back. Really annoying as it is great in every way. BUT Samsung decided not to include a headphone jack \"to make the tablet thinner\"!! I foolishly didn't think to check if it had a headphone jack as I didn't think Samsung were foolish enough to lose it. There are plenty of thin tablets out there with headphone jacks but now, if I want a Samsung S5e tablet, I have to throw my expensive Sennheiser away and splash out on a new bluetooth headset (which I will have to remember to charge) to watch movies on my daily commute and the inbuilt speakers are pretty useless. How much thickness did you save Samsung?? 0.5mm??? Well that lost you this sale and others.",
            "Cannot find a negative with this product. Very happy with product.",

Less than impressed that it cost me £160 extra after 11 trips back and forth to the shop, a month without a tablet whilst it was away for repair then the offer of a Tab A  which is a much lower spec than the Tab 2 had been.

The tablet is fast; other tablets tend to slow down when using desktop mode for websites but this does not at all.

The screen is very good - not quite Tab S4/Tab S6 standard but you'll pay a premium for either of them. Performance is snappy and the specs should mean that it will last years before any app makes it feel sluggish.\nOnly gripes are that it weirdly needs 4 seconds of the power button being pressed to switch on and that there isn't a 'mini' version as I would've preferred maybe a 9\" model.",

This is possibly the best tablet for media consumption, the screen is 1440p resolution, Super AMOLED and is beautiful to watch moves or YouTube on! Dual AKG speakers get very loud and sound great considering it is a tablet and the metal construction is excellent. The fact you can upgrade the storage with a Micro SD helps to future proof the device. Big recommendation from me.",
            "Very pleased with the picture-quality, speed, appearance, weight and slimness compared with my old Tab3 but it lacks an audio jack-socket and, although an adapter is included to enable ear-phones to be plugged into the usbC socket, you can't use this to both charge the tablet and listen via 'phones at the same time. However this is only a minor inconvenience and a small price to pay for the otherwise vastly improved user-experience (as my next 'phones will probably be wireless anyway!).",

I LOVE this tablet, as a new user it was very easy to find my way around, though still learning new stuff daily. I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone looking for one. I've  just ordered the keyboard case in Hope's of using it like a mini laptop at home. My only wish is that it would have come with users manual to explain all it does or can do.Being a newbie tablet user that would have been great, but I'm  learning as I go along by simply using it.",

Two drawbacks would be firstly wifi drops if you go too far from your router, a common review that I ignored but it's very true and disappointing for something that relies heavily on internet connectivity, and secondly (and this may not effect all people) it does not support the Samsung Spen. But overall an excellent tablet for watching videos, playing games and work related apps.",
            "I love samsung products and this tablet is no exception. Great value for money and the screen is amazing. Battery life is brilliant, will last a few days without needing a charge.\n\nThe one problem I had that is seen elsewhere, is that the positioning of the wifi antena and that if you hold it in a certain way it disconnects from the wifi. It is on some of the batches that went out so this is the only bad thing about it. This is Samsung's fault not Argos.\n\nArgos were amazing in swapping",
            "No nasty surprises and a few good ones. \n\nDrives just like my Samsung Galaxy S8 phone, so easy to setup. Screen is good, audio is surprisingly good and it has GPS, unlike iPad wi-fi models, so great for Apps like Memory Map. The fingerprint scanner on the On button works well, a slight slide of the finger is all you need. Works with a Sandisk 256GB micro-SD inserted.\n\nThe only bad point is the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack. All in all I'm happy this tablet was good value for money.",
            "This product was to replace my old Nexus 7 . I have not lost any performances and the larger screen is easier to see. I like the SD port but would have preferred a more accessible design without the need for a pin to extract.",

            "Purchased to replace my Tab A 10.1, I wasn't using much because the screen was poor & sensitivity wasn't great.\n\nThis is 100% better, it's light, slick & has a gorgeous screen & big storage that can be expanded via a microSD card.\n\nI'm glad I purchased this as I was was considering an iPad, but this is far more useful.\n\nThe only negatives are the price; which is a little bit high & the battery life \n\nOverall I would recommend this.",

            "Really happy with this as it's not only android but dex and linux ubuntu ! Cant wait to start tinkering with my iOT home kit via the linux terminal. Only downside is there is no keyboard cover with trackpad which is a must for using as a productivity device. Please please please Samsung make one for this device as you have the upcoming tab s6.",
            "I looked at the iPad ….. too expensive, the Surface …… way too expensive, then found this Samsung 5Se and I love the build quality and the speed.  I have a Samsung 9+ and everything I can do on that I can to on this, but bigger.",

            "Amazing. I can not fault this tablet one bit. I have had it for 1 month now and doesn't fail to amaze me. The battery is unreal, it last 2 to 3 days and that is with good use. The quad speakers are really loud and I do not need to connect a speaker. I love that you can add a memory card to the device to give me more space for my apps, photos and videos. \n\nI'm so in love with it and would recommend it to anyone.",
            "Very happy with my purchase",
            "i upgraded my ipad 9.7 2018 to this as i wanted more storage with this being able to take up to a 512gb card i was happy buy the tablet purchase a memory card where as some companys bigger storage means bigger price where you can choose the memory size by which card you purchase also the screen what can i say vivid 10.5 inch sAMOLED display is amazing best purchase by far",
            "I have read some negative reviews and I can understand some of the points raised.\nBut for the price this tablet is excellent, especially the display. Sure, it’s no powerhouse\nHowever, for media consumption you cannot go wrong.  I was surprised at just how good this device is.",
            "I bought this tablet like 10 days ago, and Its great! Its fast does its job and it has a lot of storage and Ram. If you want a reliable tablet fast and with a great look. This one is the one, great job Samsung",
            "I think the Samsung S5e tablet is fast enough with the best tablet screen i have ever seen.",
            "2 second audio delay while streaming anything to tv via cable.  So streaming anything is unwatchable.  (using official samsung dex cable fyi).  Also doesnt matter if it is in screen mirroring mode or dex mode.  Same audio delay with both.  You cant even pause video to get them back in sync.  It just stutters the video right from the get go.\nWaste of money",
            "In terms of battery and screen this tablet is great. In terms of Wifi connectivity it is terrible. i also own a Galaxy Tab S2 and have never had Wifi drop out in my house but with the S5e the signal drops all the time causing my streaming apps like Sky Go and Netflix to pause or crash. Very annoying as i expected this to have at least the same connectivity as my 4 year galaxy Tab S2. Also never realised there was no head phone jack with this product. Disappointed.",
            "It is very lightweight  unlike my old tab A ..the only problem is the turn on button it very small at the side other than that I am very pleased and would recommend it ..its fast and looks good ...",
            "The initial set up was very easy, and using the Tablet was very simple, resolution was very good. After approx 2 hours of use the Wi Fi signal dropped out, although my mobile and laptop were fine. Upon further checking, this does apear to be a common problem with this series of models. The tablet was returned to Argos",

            "The Samsung Tab S5e is a thin and sleek looking tablet, it is very light so great for taking out. I am buying a case for this as I'm worried with it being slim that it could get damaged easily. The screen is fantastic, bright and great quality. The response time of the tablet is good and it downloads apps quickly. The battery lasts all day but with heavy use it needs charging after half a day. Quick to set up from opening the box. Good amount of storage compared to similar priced tablets",

And the amoled\n\nI removed or turned off the Samsung bloatware and installed a different launcher.\n\nOne little niggle ( perhaps I haven't got used to it) is that the bezels are so thin sometimes you touch the screen accidentally.\n\n Not the cheapest tablet but one with a great screen and build that should last for a fair few years.",

            "Got this to replace a LG G Pad 8.9, pleased with the larger size screen and excellent build quality. Screen very clear and easy to read. Plenty of storage available with the 64gb, though it seems to use a fair bit of the 4gb available memory for just basic operation, leaving average of 1.5gb without any apps running, but this is fine for my usage. Performance good for browsing the web, listening to music and watching video clips. Use mostly for Kindle reading app, where the battery lasts well.",
            "Very good tablet very good sound however they should have considered to allow customers to purchase a pen like tab S4",
            "Bought this for the DeX feature. Samsung website says you can use USB-C to HDMI and I have a generic dock with keyboard monitor etc.  This worked with my last Android tablet and work PC but not with Samsung.  Screen comes on for about 5 seconds then disconnects,  a message pops up saying you have to use 'genuine Samsung accessories' to use DeX.  The screen comes on for a second s so it works, Samsung has just decided to lock it down to their own HDMI connectors.  \n\nShould say this up front, wouldn't have bought it if i had known.",

            "Purchased as a special gift for my daughter (who loves graphic design) I was impressed with this tablet as soon as I took it out of the box. It has a sleek look comparable to another leading tablet and performance wise has not disappointed. My daughter is thrilled.",
            "Excellent tab and recommend.",
            "Good looking, functional piece of kit which perfectly fits the tablet.\nJust missing an indentation to ease opening but otherwise does the job fine.",
            "Bought this two months ago, was happy but now seriously hacked off, Settings, seems to reset every time you leave it for more than an hour, meaning the screen lock out defaults to 30 seconds as do the sound settings. Very irritating, rebooting or even a factory reset has no effect",
            "Really good battery life .nice and slim tablet too ...",

            "Works very well looks great battery last a long time well worth the money",
            "Good points: generous memory and storage, reputable brand, smart thin device.\nBad points: finger print sensor unreliable - quite confusing integrating it with the power button, as it is all too easy to select the wrong function.\nI bought it for my wife's birthday, having earlier replaced my own 7 inch tablet with an 8 inch Huawei device. From what little I have seen of the Samsung, I must say that the Huawei powers up a lot faster and feels slicker than the Samsung.",
            "1.  It's super thin. Don't even consider using it until you get a case. \n2. Tons of memory, and with 4Gb of RAM it loads fast \n3. I personally don't see much improvement in screen quality over my Tab S\n4. Sound is absolutely brilliant, music and games sound great\n5. You can't plug a standard headphone in, probably due to the tablet thickness. You have to use a small interface cable in the charge port\n6. It comes with horrendous bloatware. So much, it eats up almost 10Gb of the 64Gb memory",
            "Nice tablet with high quality screen resolution which shows great sharpness and colour of my photography pictures, easy to navigate through, like the close all apps down feature saving battery power, would definitely recommend.",
            "I've had the 126gb version four days and yes it looks really smart, and fantastic display and awesome sound, but it does lag loading webpages/Facebook etc.  The WiFi as others have said is poor, I can be sat in the same room not 6 ft from the router and the lag is terrible.  In other parts of the house I've WiFi repeaters, again this performs poorly compared to the Tab A 10.1 which seems to have much better WiFi.\n\nAnother issue I found while installing everything, if you've several items qued to download in the Google play store, they'll just hang and never download unless you clear the apps cache.  I think their is an issue in how this tablet functions, maybe it's the same problem for the WiFi as the signal strength looks good.",
            "I am writing this on it and its incredible value for money! Slick and fast with a beautiful screen",

            "I've just moved up from the Tab S2 and to be quite honest, I'm unimpressed, underwhelmed and disappointed with the tablet.\n\nThe colours compared to the S2 are dull and lifeless and lack punch, the screen lacks sharpness and don't get me started about the Wifi network, I have a choice of 2.4G and 5G upstairs with repeaters and a Bt home hub 6 with repeaters downstairs and it can't pick up the home hub or 5G signal or repeaters from either network.",
            "Fabulous tablet for a not so expensive price tag. Brilliant display and sleek model are two important factors make this model very attractive. Can't say about the battery life as I am with this tablet only for about a few weeks. Overall it is an impressive tablet so far",

            "Perfect super light and battery is good.  Performance is good no lag as of yet anyways. Would recommend to anyone. Still slightly pricey for what it is but quality is good. Camera not so great as I thought to be honest but does the job.",
            "Love this tablet, lighter and slimmer than my previous S3 tab, love the design and the OS too. Can't complain and Samsung keep it up, this partners my S10+ perfectly.",
            "Samsung produce yet another great tablet,  and not overpriced,  very happy with the product",
            "i read the reviews before purchasing this. i do really like it but every app seems to have trouble loading nd its not due to the wifi because my phone (note 9) and laptop has no trouble loading on wifi i tried even disconnecting my phone with no luck. Also the wifi is definitely a problem in your left hand it has disconnected several times and also drops in connectin at times due in my hand please find a solution whether this is a case or something else. Currently you dont even offer a case to purchase! if these 2 problems were sorted i would absolutely love it but until then i cant recommend it over other tablets.",
            "Crashed within the hour, thinking it is a software problem, trieded to update the firmware only to be told, your current software version isn't supported, visit a service centre. WOW, this is a brand new tablet that will be going back and will stick with what i know works.",
            "Replacement for my 4 year old Samsung Tab S 10.5 I have been using the Tab S5e for just over a week & I am verify impressed, the AMOLED screen fantastic & great for my eyes, no eye strain. The fingerprint sensor is on the power button so is well placed. If you like music this is perfect the quad speakers give out very good sound quality, great for music.\n\nThe battery life is very good. The tablet is thin & light. For most games but heavy graphics my struggle.",
            "Wifi stops working when you have your hand holding the corner of the tablet .",
            "There was no headphone jack! \nAnd the bluetooth stays on even though it is in standby mode.\nAnd it is full of annoying bloatware that confuses the bleep out of you and which generates tons of annoying notifications every 30 seconds.\nCome on Samsung, what the dickens are you playing at, copying some of apple's most annoying and hated features? \nAnd no cover or type cover at launch? You might not care, but the type cover for the Tab s4 is so terrible some of us want to know what we are in for.\nAnd of course the s pen from note 8 doesnt work on it. I mean why would it? It's not like it is a good idea to have some form of cross compatibility. No, much better to act like every product you make is new and incompatible with each other.\nAnyone would think your company is full of people who don't talk to each other or really care about customers.",
            "If you're after a tablet with decent specs and performance for a reasonable price then this tablet fits the bill.\n\nI have been using it for nearly 2 weeks and overall quite satisfied. It is ridiculously thin, is light and the bezel is spot on.  Battery life is good and with moderate use I've easily had 2 days without a recharge.  I thought I would try the S Pen from my previous Galaxy tablet but it isn't recognised, sadly.\n\nI do however have a few minor gripes I think people should be aware of...\n- There are still no accessories available in the UK since launch, leaving me to rely on 3rd party generic ones, such as a cover.  \n- When viewing in landscape there's no option to swap the volume buttons, so they appear to be working backwards.\n- The home screen grid size is stupidly small (6x5 blocks) with no option to change it. This means adding a calendar widget literally takes up half the screen!\n- WiFi is a little slower (around 200Mbs) compared to my S9 but is only noticeable when testing download speeds.\n- Lastly, considering this is an OLED screen, fast scrolling vertically in any app causes a very slight and strange 'wobble' effect, as if the left side is always catching up with the right. It can be a little distracting but otherwise the screen is brilliant and doesn't have any issues with fast motion in games or video.\n\nIssues assure, you gets decent tablet for the price. Performance is solid and the Dex environment has a lot of potential. The camera is 'OK' and will be fine for most.",
            "Tablets is good but u can not get all games on it",
            "It's a nice tablet,but I would prefer 8inch one,if there would be one. Works very well, has plenty of memory for photos and videos. Small problem is,that on my old samsung, I could access videos from tbe main screen, but on this one, I have to go to downloads. It's a bit more fiddly. I am still getting use to it, but over all its a very good product.",
            "This was a replacement for my Tab s2 which was getting a bit tired. \nThe first thing I noticed was the thinness, it is very thin and a suitable case or cover is advised, the other thing that I found strange was that the fingerprint sensor is not in the same place as the Tab S2, it's on the right hand side incorporated into the on off button, once you get used it, its very convenient and fast in response, it is running very smoothly and it recharges the battery quickly. I would recommend tablet.",
            "This all seems Fantastic but I would like to know if this tablet supports the use of a pencil",
            "Had it a couple of weeks, fantastic product! Great battery life, screen is PERFECT and the small bezels only add to the immersive experience. \n\nOne criticism is that the volume buttons aren't reversed when in landscape (so they are the wrong way round in landscape) - which is annoying when watching media which you definitely want to do with this screen! Buttons are all on the same side so it makes sense to rotate the tab to landscape button side up.",
            "I already had a samsung galaxy tab s2 loaded with apps and music. Really appreciated smart switch which copied everything onto the new tablet. Will not take it anywhere until i can get a cover as it is very thin. Would have preffered a gold colour finish, would have liked a cover similar to the studs on the s2. It has been very easy to get going, facial recognition not working well at moment but fingerprint working well.",
            "Got the 128 GB Model , and impressed up to now , quick , smooth, good sound , lots of my apps downloaded onto it show \"not optimised for this device\" but I guess that's what happens when the device is new to the market.\nTried with the 256gb card as I have many pictures ( will be using this tablet mostly for editing when away from home) and transfer rates are good.\n\nThe only thing that I have noticed is the thinner bezel around the screen means my pudgy fingers often activate the screen touch sensors unintentionally, but I'll adapt.\n\nCharge time quick , and initial usage appears to show this unit is going to have a long battery life\n\nAlso with this being brand new there is a lack of accessories cases ect.",
            "Had my tab5 a few days now and overall very pleased with it. The screen is excellent. Quad speakers very nice of course the output quality is dependent upon the input broadcast quality so I haven't experienced it at it's best yet. Nice light table very quick from startup and opening and closing applications. Lots of features yet to explore. I haven't  found much to criticise, two small issues are, no covers available yet to protect my valuable piece of equipment and the overall finish is very smooth so you are in danger of inadvertently dropping it. Also using the tab without a cover is awkward because the screen comes so close to the edge it's difficult to keep your fingers clear of the screen. However very pleased with my purchase.",
            "Arrived the Saturday of the Easter weekend and writing review late Easter Monday.  Arrived charged up and then spent a few painless hours flicking back and forth letting the tab s5e complete a mirror installation from my s9plus.  Only used for web browsing via chrome and YouTube awesome display, speakers dont seem much louder than s9plus but quickly went to headset that was delivered with the s9plus via the c-usb adapter that comes with the s5e no headset included.  Easter Sunday it wouldn't turn on and had to complete a reset holding vol and off key for about 16 sec.  Spent about an hour over the day using again impressed with the display. Easter Monday started using for YouTube and screen went blank after 10 minutes again wouldn't come on and completed a vol and power reset and this time it rebooted in safe mode followed by me completing reset in normal.  \nIt's great but obviously there is some teething problems.  It seems Samsung didnt push out the size to the case manufacturer's as trying to get a case from otterbox, lifeproof or zagg or any of the copy companies is currently not possible.",
            "First impressions after two days use are that this is a great value for money product with good performance for day to day use. I’ve had no issues with consuming video, multiple tab browsing on chrome and other general apps from the play store. I’m running this tablet side by side with my iPad 12.9 and the display is comparable although obviously smaller however the colours are in my opinion slightly better and sharper. Next step is to get the micro sod card and storage will never be an issue in the future.\nIn short. For 379 gbp it’s incredible value for money and well worth the purchase. It’s a shame that on release date there are no cases available on Samsung’s website as the tablet should definitely be protected against bumps and scratches. I’m using the tablet for my daily commute and won’t be travelling with it until I do have a case",
            "Pre ordered this tablet and was looking forward to receiving it. The day finally came and wow nice piece of kit. But after just 2 or 3 hours of use it was knackered."
