            "Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is perfect for families on the move. It's lightweight, so the kids catching up with their favourite shows is as comfy in the back of the car as it is on the sofa. And whatever you watch looks great on a big 10.4 display that shows every detail. You can entertain the whole household by playing music through your speakers or sharing all your best videos and photos. "

I also really love the ability to expand your storage which is something that comes in handy.",

I shouldn't spend 1k on a tablet).\n\nI also find watching videos on this is better because the shape is more rectangular where the ipad is square like.",

            "A whopping £40 dearer than Currys big mistake by me for not checking prices",
            "So the tablet hardware is excellent. Screen is crisp, decent memory, SD card slot, and the S-Pen feature is a winner.\nUnfortunately, once again Samsung fail to deliver in the software department. Many Samsung apps that work on the phone don't work in the tablet (e.g. Samsung health) which makes it pointless paying so much more extra for a Samsung tablet if these apps don't work or sync - may as well buy a stock Android tablet for a lower price and better spec.. Even the S-Notes won't sync up to other devices/software(eg OneNote) despite it being part of the app settings!\n\nSo overall good hardware, nice tablet but pointless paying so much extra because the software doesn't work.",
            "Everything seems good had it couple of weeks now only thing i can pick and poke at is lock/power button location as its next to the volume button i ended locking the tablet rather than adjusting the volume",

            "A great tablet with a big screen, brilliant for watching films etc on.\nNice and quick, with great sound on it. \nGreat for playing games on, although couple of my games crash. \nIt responds brilliant, and definitely worth buying",

            "Purchased as my old tablet wouldn't let me update some if the apps. A full battery charge lasts quite a long time and is ideal for playing games.",
            "Very good tablet, it's a nice size and works smoothly. So far this is the best tablet I've ever had.",
            "Best tab yet with so much to discover. I thought at first that there was no manual provided but  there is one in settings. I find the S pen is very handy and the click in cover i purchased has a groove at the back that the pen slots in held by a loop and keeps the pen safe and sound where it charges.\nThis tablet needs a cover as it is very slippy and could easily be dropped when carrying it.",
            "No problems . Works well",
            "Lovely and light, not too bad on battery life and its nice and light",

            "Works as intended good value for money",
            "This tablet is literally the best. It's all I actually needed and has the ability to use Microsoft word,excel,PowerPoint. The pen is really easy to use and is really comfortable and easy to use especially that it's free with the tablet. Overall the screen is really crystal clear large and beautiful. Every thing on it runs really fast and has a decent storage plus ability to upgrade. Honestly 10/10 would buy another.",
            "I bought this as a successor to a previous 8inch samsung tablet. It was very easy to set up and use. Gives a bigger sharper picture on Zoom than the 8 inch version. Quite light too. Overall a good value buy and I would reccomend to others.",
            "The only moan I have is that the way you turn it off is completely different to my old one even though it looks exactly the same. Has a voice operated system on it if you like that type of thing. Overall very pleased",
            "This tablet is amazing for artists I 100% recommend it and wouldn't have wanted any other product.",
            "This is the 2nd one I’ve had to purchase as the first one was returned under warranty 2 months after I bought it. It doesn’t charge. The 2nd one is 3 weeks old and has the same problem so I’ll be returning it and buying an Apple IPad",

            "Bought it for my grandkids, for home schooling. Pen has made big difference and easier work, although it does come with the price. But it was worth it.",
            "I am very happy with my Galaxy Tab is very fast",
            "Bought this to help with home schooling. After 1 day using the Seesaw App, we realised a laptop and PC weren't going to cut it, so, after a few hours research, and looking at lots of cheaper options, we settled on the Tab S6 Lite. Having never owned a tablet before, we really had to rely on reviews - and everything pointed us to the Samsung. The addition of a stylus nailed this one for us. It's been invaluable for my boys completing their online schoolwork, and they've really adapted well to it.",

            "I bought this tablet for my Son who needed a device to do his online schooling on but also wanted something that was good for drawing using a stylus. This is great for both.

Very good.\nThe thing feels solidly built but it's light enough to use as an ebook reader.\nIt's quick and the display is great but the thing that I love most is the pen.\nMy handwriting is officially awful but it copes really well - I've used both the Samsung keyboard and Google's GBoard - they both deciphered my scrawl well but I've settled on GBoard as it's just \"nicer\" to work with.\nOnly downside - pen storage. It doesn't fit in the tablet - it sticks on with a magnet.",

After setting it up and playing with it a bit, I found it to be very user friendly and quick.

            "Brilliant tablet, very happy with it however I think it should have an in-built pen holder or stronger magnet in the pen as when its not in a case it feels like the pen could be lost quite easily.",
            "The tablet is more than great value for the money. The pen makes it even more user friendly and gives you more choices as to how you work. My daughter loves it for school tasks and play time including drawing and improving writing skills. The earbuds that came as a bonus make it even better choice. Highly recommended.",

            "Great value, fast and light. The screen is vivid and sounds great especially when gaming using streaming services like GeForce Now and Xbox Game Pass. For those with butter fingers, I'll recommend getting a case along as you find it too sleek lol.",
            "Love the tablet and pen. Hate not having a proper way of keeping the pen safe. I had mine 2months and lost the pen because it detached its self whilst walking back to my car. The tablet is just that without the pen and its a bitter one when you have to replace it. A better carriage for the pen and it would be fantastic.",
            "Used for designing, stylus is very good with the right software. Stylus pen is magnetic to the side of the tablet but isn't the strongest so get a cover with a pen holder so avoid losing it!",

            "Easy to use if you're familiar with Samsung products",

            "I bought it for writing abilities and the screen not too big to be portable but still learning how to use its features fully. One needs to find out how to facilitate that cross between a mobile and a laptop navigating through downloads and settings:)",
            "I have to say this tablet is absolutely amazing. I have been really impressed with the performance so far. The Galaxy Tab S6 lite isn't really for those who want the best but it's there fore those who want great value for money but some powerful features. The tablet comes with a fantastic 10.4 inch which is LCD and a Enxyos 9611 processor and 4GB RAM & 64GB RAM which is a lot more than the 32GB which you get in the iPad 10.2 which is the cloest alternative to this tablet. The performance is wonderful and I've not seen it witnessed much lag or buffering. The smoothness is really good on this tablet. Plus watching YouTube is a pleasure with a nice glass screen and 4GB RAM. I really enjoy it. Personally the only issue is I wish maybe the tablet had more RAM and maybe OLED and a larger battery. But the tablet in summary for me is wonderful and with great specs it's very enjoyable using this device. I have to say one of my favourite Tablers. Period.",
            "Good tablet with a fairly long battery life.  Clear screen and no problems so far.  Needed to purchase a case which stands as I do a lot of reading with app from Library.  A bundle choice would have been great.  Something for Argos to think about.",
            "The tablet is very light (clue's in the name) and fairly easy to use, it reacts quickly but I haven't tried the \"pen\" yet, it just seems like too much trouble going to get it.  The only negative is that the tablet feels quite delicate & although I'm not particularly clumsy, I do drop things  & I suspect this might really break if dropped, so I wouldn't suggest purchasing it for your average small child/teen.  All in all though, a good purchase.",
            "Really good tablet, a bit pricey but performance is incredible",
            "Good product delivered on time",
            "Wanted something more versatile and more interactive with Samsung phone and Win 10 desktop than ipad....and s6 lite does the job. Cameras the same 8MP but i have a decent camer. I want to be able to swap files, data, pics etc around devices without resorting to cloud services. I want my data where i want it, when i want it, on whatever device im on..and it does that very well, complimenting the other devices and giving me the versatility and flexability that I want.",

            "Does everything and more that i need",
            "Competitive price and easily available in stock the tablet does everything that it should do. The pen is great for work notes rather than keyboard as I am usually a 1 finger typist.

The pen, the screen, the customizable UI.\nThen one day I was reading with the tablet and the tablet just died.\nSamsung logo appeared then it failed. Tried soft reset, tried different chargers. Very disappointed that a tablet could fail like this. Lucky I could get an automatic replacement as in the 30 days. Hope the new one fairs better but was disappointed to say the least. My 4 year old Amazon fire tablet never missed a beat. This cost over twice as much and failed after a week.",
            "Had a chance to get a S6 lite tablet from Sky and thought why not as mine was getting on. And because I have Samsung phone was very easy to use. Will admit miss having a S pen with phone.",

            "Stylish and functional, however I was a bit disappointed with the somehow poor performance for the price. The inclusion of an amazing pen that provides a great writing experience almost makes me forget the lack of responsiveness (for the price) when changing apps opening apps.",
            "I hate the fact that you press 1 button to turn it on , yet you have to press 2 buttons simultaneously to turn it off ,",

            "So far so good, love the pen. Coupled it with a keyboard and the laptop hasn't been switched on since. Very handy bit of kit, don't know why I waited until now. I'm a civil engineering manager and I'm always on the road. With the O2 sim card my nightly entertainment is at a touch of a button anywhere. Top job Samsung and O2.",

            "Excellent for multiple purposes to what I wanted it in the first place, including combining a creative app with a medium platform. It could have been better if the device came with its own creative [Samsung] app, otherwise I'm very much happy with it. Thumbs up!",
            "I love it, it lets me do all my work and still have storage for my games and movies, its awesome screen is compatible with the s pen and I love using pen up",

            "just love,the fact that you can not only use it as a tablet but also as a substitute  for a phone is great.",

            "I have had Samsung mobiles and bought this as a larger version ease of use ,same features as the phones,,due to failing eyesight this is larger to use and easy. Would reccomend the tab s6.was told the product tab s5e .was great  and so I bought one ,however they didn't have in stock so purchased the newer version instead.",
            "I like that its not too big and so light too. The only bad thing I found is the nib on the pen doesn't last very long",
            "Is absolutely amazing,Samsung galaxy s20 plus,and the buds are great.",

            "samsung galaxy top of the pops.",
            "This tablet is great. So many great features and the performance is really top notch. I think for the price apart from this and the iPad 10.2 you can't get any better. The storage is great at 64GB so you can store loads and with memory card expansion it's even better. Plus with the S Pen you can do some cool things also. One UI 2.1 is brilliant plus even better 3 yrs worth of updates  Samsung really upped the game & showed how it is done when you mean a great quality tablet. Well done Samsung!",
            "Really enjoying my Samsung tablet.",

            "Nice product excellent service",
            "I dont use yet but I offer this item like gift i hope is good choice",
            "The S6 Lite looks fantastic and could easily be mistaken for a more expensive tablet. Screen size is perfect for reading, drawing or just watching movies when relaxing. Picture and sound quality are amazing! The S Pen included is great, very precise when drawing and clips neatly to the side when not using. My only issue is that the USB-C cable is quite short so you can’t use the tablet while charging it. However, the battery life is really good so this shouldn’t be a problem. Highly recommended.",
            "This tablet does what most Samsung devices do. Its easy to set up and use and is really quick. Good value.\nWould recommend",
            "This will tick all the right boxes. An excellent, mid range tablet. You get a pen with it too.",

            "B ought as a replacement for a similar 2O14 tablet, and works very well for what I need it for; email, web,annotating Pdf documents (e.g. filling in forms,signing letters ) and giving online lectures via shared screen with Zoom and Teams . For those I use the stylus which also does handwriting recognition, which is what I am now using to write this review, with almost no editing. I do not expect to use audio or video except for online meetings for which it is good.",
            "The tablet is great value, has super screen and the stylus pen is very good also. We purchased additional microSD memory card.",
            "Great tablet, speed - Ease of use - portability etc is all brilliant.",
            "I purchased this tablet as a replacement for my 2012 iPad Mini, which had slowed down considerably. My favourite feature is the S Pen, which I get a lot of mileage from as a writer, in fact I have taken to using the S Pen exclusively when using my tablet. \n\nThe sound quality is good - a considerable step up from what I was accustomed to on my iPad, however I am awaiting fixes for a couple of apparent bugs in Zoom. It stands up very well to every day use - media, gaming and writing.",
            "This tablet is amazing, I originally brought it to try and draw on and it has served that and every other need I have perfectly! The pen is also comfortable, light weight and very helpful! Best tablet I've brought to date, would definitely recommend.",
            "Love the pen it works well for highlighting pdf files and writing notes. The stereo volume is great as well and can be loud but very well.\n\nThe only cons is that the brightness in maximum is still not that high so in the sun it can be difficult to use.",
            "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a well-rounded iPad competitor, and it’s arguably the best non-premium tablet the company has ever put out. It has strengths, from the inclusion of the S Pen to software customization options and a fairly robust and good-looking design. There are some performance issues, however, which could affect the overall user experience.",
            "My Samsung tablet is great it is sleek, has a pen which makes typing really easy.  I purchased a case which protects it.  Charge lasts at least 12 hrs which is great for me.  Has plenty of storage for my games etc........ really pleased.",
            "If you are wanting a versatile machine that doesn't have many security issues then give this tablet a Go! It isn't as fast as IOS but for a LITE version of a more expensive version then it is good. I find the games load and play smoothly and the S pen works with ease. The drawing apps can be fun, i found them relaxing with the S pen, It also works fine with games too. Overall, patience is needed if you are used to IOS, if you already prefer android then this is recommended.",
            "I have had Samsung Tablets for a number of years and always got on well with them. I am struggling with the S6 Lite 10.4in , mainly down to the frustrating new Android operating system. I am slowly working my way through the manual and may become proficient with it eventually. For now, I regret making the purchase, and if I see that hideous Mr Blobby thing on my home page once more I won't be responsible for my actions!!",
            "Treated myself to a new tablet as my old one kept running out and apps couldn't update. It was easy to set up and has everything I need. Haven't used the S pen yet, but I'm really pleased with my purchase",

            "Good tablet for a good price. Got a free gift so very cost effective overall and as I hate Apple pricing the minor compromises are not an issue.",
            "So far so good. My only concern is whether 64GB is enough. Look and feel are good, apps are OK. Shame word, excel are not free but I should be able to cope and workaround. Bought to replace a small laptop that I used to take on long hiking trips to keep my daily log.",
            "Best price I found from all companies and the customer service great, fast and prompt! I love shopping at Argos. Best company in UK !!!",

            "This is a great tablet. The design and feel of the product makes it feel worth more then the price. The writing with the S Pen is very comfortable and natural feeling. This is my first Android tablet I’ve had in many years. I’ve been an iPad user for 10 years. I am very happy with my purchase. \nThe only reason I didn’t give this 5 stars is the lack of a finger print scanner or true face unlock. This is very annoying when it comes to password storage.",
            "Easy to see and much easier to use with pen",
            "This is a really good tablet a lot faster than my previous one, everything works great and have claimed my free cover case from Samsung. I love the colour and it was a great price.",
            "easy to use,has all the functions I need . Compatible with my phone",
            "Best suited as a portal notebook/entertainer. The tab itself is standard with few upgrades, the take away for me was the S pen - perfect for taking notes, drawing, magnetic attachment to the tab, doesn't need to be charged. Lastly, battery if fab - lasted me 12 hours for browsing, watching YouTube while being connected to Bluetooth.",
            "Good mid range tablet for price, s pen is a handy bonus",
            "Its fab!   Just love everything about it.  Sound is amazing as well as the great hd screen.",
            "this tablet fit the spec I wanted for a good price. I have wanted a new tablet for some time but didn't want to invest in something that didn't have the right spec, but also didnt want to pay £500. This ticked all the boxes. \nGreat design, easy to use, the pen works great even with tempered glass screen protector. Battery is solid, I have played rome total war on it and it holds up well considering that is a resource intense game.\n\nOverall I love it!",
            "Great tablet. Includes the pen. I'm very happy with my choice.",
            "A very good tab. Gave a gift to my daughter. She loves it.",
            "A fantastic tablet, the sound is the best I have heard from a tablet, screen it's crystal clear and sharpe. Only disappointing thing is the memory size but it's the same on most tablets, your get a mirco SD slot so you can add more memory.",

            "Great value for money. Arrived before time, S pen is addictive! Highly recommended",
            "I recived this a few days ago after pre ordering it. Going from a S2 tab to the S6 lite. I found it quick, screen bright, and all the features and build you expect from Samsung. Can I find a manue,l nope but not a big issue at ths stage. What is my biggest disappointment - it does not have Samsung Dex, Why oh why? hence only 3 stars on features.",
            "This seems worth my money buy far, with this form factor I only needed a nice portable tablet with pen support and omg usb C and the 3.5mm audio port is genuinely the best combo. I'm putting my faith in this product even though it's a Lite version of the tab s6, I have a Galaxy tab E Lite for almost 2yrs now and it's not high end, a little lag here and their but it never ever failed at performing any task I throw at it and that's what I like!"
