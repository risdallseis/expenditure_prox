I cant get over how light it is! It literally feels like a tablet, it weighs next to nothing and is really thin.

I spent 1.5 hours with HP tech support & their only solution was to undo update and turn off updates. This is unacceptable as virus definitions are part of Windows updates. Had to purchase a USB WiFi adapter so I could install updates and still connect to WiFi. I'm sure this will be fixed, but in how many months?",

Having spent time reading reviews, I knew exactly what the pros and cons of this machine were and it has not disappointed. Really easy to set up, very quick start up and multi-tasks with ease. The only minor niggle is the lack of contrast on the keys making them difficult to read in less than good light - this is something that was mentioned by other reviewers. Good value for money.",

I would then have probably realised that it feels flimsy (its not a business laptop), the perimeter edge is very sharp and the pad does not have a scroll bar (I never use a mouse). I bought it as a replacement for my Acer Aspire 5551 which gave me many years of trouble free service, so I'm judging it against that.",

            "I bought this a couple of weeks ago and so far I can't fault it. Lightweight, quiet, quick and easy to use. I researched and reviewed loads of laptops for the one that would suit me best and this is the one that was best in my price range. Plus _ Norton 360 was included.",
            "Partner's laptop died so needed a replacement quickly. Hunted everywhere but with high demand there were very few available anywhere. Wanted i3 or i5 processor with budget of £500 it was either this or an i3 with hard drive not SSD from another high street chain for £70 less but felt extra for i5 + SSD worth it.\nNot a bad laptop and does everything she will need - the antivirus freebie will get binned a not a fan and have McAfee on unlimited devices anyway.\nA big plus is it's very light.",

            "I’m satisfied with the delivery , got the laptop the very next day. \nBut I cannot use the Norton antivirus because when i tried to install it i got a phonecall immediately. The guy knew my name and wanted to force me to buy another  antivires package. It was so wierd . So i ended up buying a different one from another company.",
            "It does exactly what it says on the box",
            "I've only used it for few days now but I can say product design is sleek and the colour is nice too.  It is fast and serves purpose. Although I had to return the one I initially ordered.",
            "Very good laptop, I buy a new one because my old one was to slow and I'm so happy with this one. I can edit my video for YouTube and wrote my new book on it. You can open differente website page af the same time and he still working properly. I recommend this product .",

            "Very good laptop and does everything I need for business use",
            "Ordering and pick up was straight forward, as ever with Argos. When I got the laptop home I spent some time setting it up and then noticed it had a dead pixel (a black dot on the screen). I ran a few pixel fixer pages to try to sort it but it was dead so I rang Argos, took it back to a local store and exchanged it. The exchange was really straight forward and this laptop is perfect. Fast performance and sleek design. For the price, it’s a really great, relatively high spec laptop.",
            "It’s very fast and lightweight - actually feels a little cheap and insubstantial but I suppose that’s a plus if you’re carrying it around. I am pleased with it but was surprised it didn’t have a headphone jack as needed it for audio typing. Overall though good value for money.",
            "Happy with my purchase,use it for business and home life!",

            "Laptop is in good condition and price is also in budget.",
            "Love this laptop, great Matt screen means I can see in the bright as well, it can really easily multitask between apps. Super quick for browsing. Only drawback is when you are using multiple apps at a time, the fan kicks in and while this is really great for operating speed, it is super noisy!",
            "I had to return. Battery life 5 hours not the advertised 8-10. Viewing angles weren't great and the fan kicked in far too often and was very loud. Tried everything to get it to run smoothly but I don't think the processor is powerful enough, base level 1ghz with 3.6ghz boost, my phone and replacement laptop with similar specs has 2.3ghz and they run like a dream. Started up in bios originally so unsure if mine was just a dud. It looks great and is very light but I would not recommend.",
            "Bought 2 laptops in family. Perfect working and good value of money.",
            "Very happy with this purchase.Exactly as described.",
            "I Love my HP laptop! This is the second one I've owned.. the last one lasted for 7 years. It's still running perfectly except for a couple of keys that have gone rogue in the keyboard. No hesitation to recommend HP or Argos.",
            "The laptop perfomance is good, but the network adapter is really bad.\nI have a 300mbps wifi connection with bt wifi smart hub 2.\nAll my old devices were able to connect to wifi from anywhere in the house, but this laptop looses connection when i go more than a metre away from the router. I tried to update driver software and also reinstalled os but nothing worked. Finally bought a usb wireless adapter and it worked like a charm.\n\nThe laptop camera resolution is pretty bad as well",
            "Really easy to set up and impressed with free anti virus. Decent battery life and super fast on start up",
            "all was ok good ..everything was in perfect condition and exactly as it was presented on the site",
            "This laptop is quick, quiet and light and the battery life is very good. It is very easy to set up, the screen is awesome especially watching a video. There is no DVD Drive but for an external one is about £25 from Amazon. I have'nt explored it all yet but what I have seen so far I would recommend this one.",
            "good price for what  it does  ....fast",
            "This is a fantastic computer very light slim and very very fast.\n It has a long battery life . The keyboard is quite light to touch and has big letters in the keypad . This is an i5 core processor and he’s got same specs as an Apple computer.\n\nI really recommend this product as this will serve a good few years for me.",
            "Very happy with the easy set up. Great to use, opens quickly and no problems. Battery seems good. Happy so far after 2 weeks of usage.",
            "As a previous HP owner I was really looking forward to my new laptop. However within a couple of hours I knew I'd be returning this machine. \nPros: looks great, thin, light, good spec and connectivity. The brushed metal finish is a nice touch.\nCons: needs 2 hands to open, no light on power or num lock keys, no back-lit keyboard, keys hard to read in low light, cheap plastic underside, loud fan, raised rim around the edge which cuts into your wrist whilst tying. Worst HP designed laptop.",
            "I am very pleased with new Laptop.",
            "My laptop is really worth the pay and very user friendly as required.The features are advanced and the lap is light weight which makes it more easy to carry.",

            "An excellent product that I use personally, not for business",
            "Expected more but still fair compare to price",
            "Its very noisy fan with no reason sometime, when you just boot up in cold state - the fan starts running for a while before it shuts off. For quad core processer with 8 Gig memory - its very slow in loading pages/apps. Wifi keeps disconnecting every now and then- all my other devices, phones are fine - so its definitely NIC on the laptop that is causing this.\nNot a real value for money, just got this 2 weeks back and it would only get worse from here on.",
            "Only had for a week but impressed so far. Small problem with computer logging off wi-fi intermittently but think i've sorted the issue. Otherwise fast, light and easy to set up and use. Would of liked 512GB hard drive but for the price i'd certainly recommend this laptop. Battery life seems ok but not owned long enough to assess.",
            "I bought this for word processing and surfing the web. Great buy. It’s sleek, light, super fast compared to my old HP Pavillion laptop (2015 model). It literally takes seconds to start up. Soft touch keyboard so no irritating clicks every time I click the keys or mouse. I’m not into games so I can’t comment on that, but as a laptop for everyday use, it suits me perfectly. Plug & play set up means you don’t need to know anything about computers beyond where the on/off button is to get it running.",
            "Bought this hp laptop for my granddaughter for her school work. She is delighted and very happy with every part of the laptop.",
            "Nice clear screen. Good battery life. Not burdened with a load of pre-installed software that you don't want. Only slight criticism I would make is the keyboard legends are difficult to read in anything but bright light. Black buttons with white lettering would have been preferable to the silver buttons.",
            "Great laptop very easy to use and a good memory got",
            "Good all-rounder. Modern design, full hd screen which is very clear and bright. Can run a little slowly but that's what you get with Intel. I bought it knowing it wouldn't be as fast as others but instead would not heat up to burning point like the faster ones & it really met my expectations as I can have it on for long periods without it getting hot. Great for what I need it for!",

            "I was looking for a good laptop that would work speedily for a good price.\nI came across this one, average price, not cheap but not expensive. I was expecting a high performance laptop, being that this costed more than any I had purchased till now and HP has a good name to boast.\nI am not disappointed in the laptop. It seems to work great and design as well.\nIt is also lightweight which is a big bonus!\nIt just doesn't work so fast as I expected, but it certainly is great for work",
            "Good value for money mid range laptop.",
            "The Lap Top is excellent to use. It has a minimum set up and is ready to go in minutes. Operationally the lap top is very fast and has good internet response time. In hindsight I would go for a back lit key board as the letters and numbers an be difficult to see under poor lighting conditions. This however does not detract from Lap Top. A very good model at a reasonable price.",

Nice narrow bezels.\nSpeed is great. NVMe Solid state drive means near instant boot. Coupled to an i5 CPU and 8GB RAM it has decent grunt \nNegatives.\nKeyboard letters hard to see.

Compared to our previous ones this laptop is excellent in terms of start up speed and speed whilst using programs. Battery life seems good so far.",
            "For the budget I had, the HP Slim gives as good performance using the 10 th gen processor, slim line portable laptop, no fussy stuff on it and the Norton software in the pack is the deal breaker for me. You can shop around forever but for Sub 500 this will be the best you can find or at least near to it.\nNot tested the battery yet so hard to tell on longevity.",

Takes 3 or 4 days of use for it to settle down and then you can start to appreciate just how fast this system is (from pressing the power button to Windows10 login prompt is about 5 seconds!) Too soon to comment on the battery. The only negative is the fan, which is quite noisy. 5 stars in all other respects. Very satisfied with it :-)",

            "I have to say that I'm impressed with this laptop in comparison to my very old one. Certainly HP technology has improved dramatically. From the light weight to responsiveness and reliability. Battery life isn't necessarily the best but it's not an issue. Given it's a new device so time really will tell if this drops significantly after a year of usage or not.\nOne point I would like to highlight is the warranty, for some reason HP tells me I have 10 months warranty while I should have 12 months!",

            "I bought this laptop around a month ago and I have no complaints. The laptop is lightweight which is handy to travel with, despite my constant fear of being a klutz and accidently dropping it. It is weird going from a 14\" screen to a 16.5\" but that just adds to better viewing (with the great speed of an i5) during video calls and watching Netflix when you should really be working. I cannot fault this HP laptop and would easily recommend to anyone who is looking for a decent yet affordable laptop",

Only the point, if keyboard are black colour, would have been more obvious and better look. Also fan makes loud sound while using Zoom live meetings.\n\nVery handy and recommend to others to buy.",
            "A nice laptop that doesn't get too hot when on your lap. its fast, and easy to set up. its light, and although it feels light in your hands, its stable and able to cope with handing. My only gripe is the battery life, once unplugged the battery, will only stand for a few hours of use un hooked from the charger. that's my only issue with this product, I'm very happy that I made my purchase, the Norton is a good extra as well, especially if your setting up immediately.",

Decent processor, RAM and SSD hard drive deliver well.\nFeels slim and light.\nImpressive HD display. \nI would have preferred port for physical network cable as I sometimes use that for heavy internet usage, but that's a personal need - Wi-Fi connection does suffice most of the time.",

            "Boots in about 12 seconds, is fast and very light compared to my 4 year old one.\n \nThe only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that after registering the new laptop with HP on 16th May 2020, I noticed the manufacturer's warranty expires 28th Dec 2020, which is only 7 months, not 12 months as advertised on the Argos website. I'm sincerely hoping that it's a mistake on HP's part and that I haven't been sold an item which has previously been returned to the store.",
            "Really happy with this product If I’m splitting hairs Then maybe the battery life could be better and start up a couple of seconds quicker and also come with windows office! Other than that it’s bang on for the money",

            "I’m an Apple Mac man personally but couldn’t afford one just for the kids to home school on so I have had to succumb to the pain of a pc. WINDOWS PCs for me are awkward and not as straightforward to set up or use as a Mac. They also feel so much more breakable and flimsy. That said this particular model feels like the best of the bunch, especially for its price. I would recommend it but secretly wished I could have afforded a Mac ;)",
            "Great for gaming and light editing.",

            "it serves all my needs for work and entertainment",
            "Apart from a slight hitch with it shutting down on its own a few times a few weeks after we bought this, everything else has ran smoothly with easy install of Microsoft and other applications used regularly and smart link and updates. \nWould recommend.",
            "The laptop was exactly what I needed for the use I require. I has all the function and is affordable.",
            "I purchased this as a laptop for keeping at home (i.e. I don’t carry it with me at all) and for personal admin and streaming films etc. It looks really nice, quite think indeed and has a lovely wide screen. The keyboard is a bit light but doesn’t bother me at all to be honest. I only had it for a few weeks and really like it. Not sure how much carrying it around would it take but if you just buy it for a “home” computer it is more than fitting.",
            "Was looking for a sleek, light laptop and this fits the bill. So far so good. Easy to set up and  use.",

            "Quite a nice, smart looking laptop. We brought 2 of these for homeschooling the teenagers. \nFirst issue we had was a glitch with printing. we couldn’t use the hp laptop to print in colour to our hp colour printer. Took about 4 hours to rectify the issues on calls with the helpline. \n2nd issue; on one of the laptops the screen keeps going dark even though it’s on. Quite frustrating. Lost a day trouble shooting this issue.",
            "I am very happy with the purchase, the Laptop is very thing and performs excellently. I am a little concerned about thermal management as the fan seems to work very hard periodically, but no actual issues there beyond being a little noisy. Overall I would recommend.",
            "I bought this laptop two weeks ago after my old HP laptop broke down. This laptop feels great and is extremely responsive. You can clearly tell that its 10th Generation i5 processor is a massive improvement on previous models. I was very impressed by the slim line design of the laptop and was concerned that this might affect the solidity of its keyboard but I must say the keyboard is a threat to use and very responsive. Admittedly its early days yet but so far so good!!",
            "Very slim. Very light. Great specification. Powers up very quickly. Does exactly what I need. Grab one of you can. You won’t be disappointed.",
            "There are some small issues which other customers have referenced in that the fan can be noisy at times and the screen only tilted back to a certain point. I also found when I connected a CD/DVD Drive (as this does not come as part of the laptop due to its portability), I found that the CD did not play music, however, I think this would have been the case with any Windows 10 laptop. These small issues aside, I cannot fault this product. It is super speedy and I would definitely recommend this.",
            "It is a very nice laptop, quite light and comfortable when using/typing. Only minor observations: the fan is a little loud as other reviews mention, the laptop feels 'all plastic', and you can fill up your SSD fast if you like to store everything. However, given the price, it is a very nice computer for home office work, videoconferencing, and running common streaming services. I'm happy with the purchase.",
            "Price quality performance is good.I advise.",
            "This has helped my grandson with his school work and his music. It is amazing",
            "This has so far proven to be a good purchase.  The laptop loads quickly and the battery life is much better than many other laptops (with similar spec) that I've had in recent years.  I would recommend this at the price.  Good value for money.",

            "We bought an Acer and returned it because it was very slow, and we purchased this and we are blown away with it! The Core i5 10th gen processor means that it turns on and shuts down quickly, and web pages load pretty much instantly. We mostly use the laptop for gaming and editing photos and it runs very quickly and doesn't freeze at all. It is sleek, lightweight and easy to carry around and has a lovely keyboard. \nVery happy with this purchase and would highly recommend!",

            "Great laptop really pleased with it",
            "Bought this machine for my wife as she wanted to use it majorly for working on digital content. For the price it's doing a great job but could do with some features which is now standard on similar machines.\n\nA big minus is the sound of the fans when the processor is running high and sometimes the fan just starts running in the background even in sleep mode. Been using this since almost 3 months and except for the fan sounds I really don't have anything else to complain.",
            "Good quality and good performance.",
            "We needed something for the children to enable them to do their school work and keep up with their studies during the Covid 19 pandemic. Great piece of equipment for what it was needed for and the price was ok too !! We purchased two in the end, so that they had one each. Overall no complaints, was easy to set up and let them get on with their studies ASAP ( much to their disappointment ) Happy Parents :)",
            "I really liked it, light, clean designer, a good machine to have at home.",
            "Great speed but let down by poor sound, average screen, very poor keyboard and noisy fan which seems to over cool the machine even when performing light tasks.\nOne of the keys was marked/scratched which added to my disapointment. Would have returned if able during Covid 19 situation but currently not able.",
            "Love everything about it \nSlim \nLoads of memory \nLightweight",
            "I needed to get something quick for work during lockdown and I chose this laptop because it was available in my local Argos. I must admit, I don’t regret it. I mostly use it to work from home and to browse the internet and it never failed me. Very fast. Once you press the switch on button it’s on instantly and you can log on. Very good processor and I believe this processor can handle more than just browsing the internet. This computer is amazing to handle any multitaskers out there.",
            "I am glad and happy that I bought this laptop because even though I am a beginner using computer, It is user friendly.",
            "Laptop is great, turns on quickly, good quality graphics, easy to set up, fast and powerful and is ideal for basic computing and gaming.\nNot a big fan of Windows 10 but small price to pay for such a good laptop.\nBattery life is pretty average but does charge quickly.\nBiggest downfall of this laptop is its keyboard which is very basic and missing keys that you would usually find on a basic keyboard such as control key at the right side next to the arrows.\nOverall great product, happy",
            "Very good for the price",

            "Excellent laptop for the price. Speedy chipset and processor, solid performer. Even go as far as saying it outperforms much more costly options.\n\nDesign is great - minimal, slim and clean and doesn't feel cheap.\n\nThe only downsides - fan is fairly noisy (you get used to it), battery life is distinctly average and packed full of bloatware you're going to want to remove before you get cracking.",
            "So I was going to invest on a laptop and wasn’t sure exactly which one to go for. Although I had to travel a distance of this laptop. It is Leighton in weight barely notice in your bag.

            "I like almost everything about this laptop, look, feel, performance, price. Being super critical I would just say that in certain light it can be difficult to see the lettering on silver keyboard keys, a little annoyance to begin with as the keyboard config is different than my old hp  laptop. But would certainly recommend this product.",

I’m looking forward to learning more as I use it.",
