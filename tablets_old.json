I things best for kids","The tablet\/case is very step & practical for my toddler to use safely. It takes some getting used to how to add  things to her profile. My only complaint is that the home screen is too much for a young child, and I would have like more control over the display for this.

I things best for kids","The tablet\/case is very step & practical for my toddler to use safely. It takes some getting used to how to add  things to her profile. My only complaint is that the home screen is too much for a young child, and I would have like more control over the display for this. For example the Home screen doesn't just have apps\/books I have downloaded for her, but lots of suggestions which is too much for a very young child. She does enjoy using the tablet, but perhaps not as independently as i'd like","Highly recommend! Such a good learning toy!

The volume does come up on the screen for a few seconds after adjustment. The speakers are good and can be loud enough to hear soft sounds. Recommend to get a cover for it as might break if dropped.

It has all the usual basic apps but you do have the Google play store to download so you can add your apps that you want. The screen and graphics seemed good for what it was.

I did notice occasional lag with some apps when dragging, and occasionally when scrolling through pages, but it wasn't all the time. Overall though, highly recommended.","This is a must have for all the family to use, there is a built in kids pack so they are safe online, Dolby Audio Dual front facing speakers great for watching movies and gaming.Various ways of unlocking the pad including face recognition, preloaded with Android 9 a slot for micro sd card front and back facing camera which take great pictures.I found apps from the playstore were very fast to download and install. all in all its a great entertainment pad that will keep all the family happy","A great little tablet. I am not tech savi and will admit it took me a few attempts to set this up but once done l was good to go. I admit it was difficult to set up. The tablet Is chunky compared to my usual one but the graphics are good and I am pleased with the picture quality. The battery life is good and I find it easy to use. I like the build quality. It feels sturdy but would advise buying a case to keep it safe. Overall a great price of well priced kit once you have overcome the set up.","A very nice looking tablet & very thin, though i thought a tad on the heavy side, a nice size screen at 10.3 bigger than most. With H.D resolution with 1920x1200 pixels it takes great colour pictures, also great for youtube and skype, very easy to set up and find things, battery life is very good at around 14hrs normal use, less though if your on youtube, only down side is netflix won't work in HD, apart from that great for office work a good all rounder.","This is the first Android tablet I have owned and have previously been wedded to my IPad, but was pleasantly surprised by the Lenovo. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had it a week and found it easy to navigate and quick to respond. I like the wide screen and the picture quality is great. A little bit heavy compared with an IPad, but not enough to put me off. Overall it feels solid and well made. I would recommend this product.","I never expect much from tablets, but this one has exceeded my expectations. First of all, it looks great, the screen is a good size at 10\n3\", and the picture quality itself is more on par of a laptop than any tablet I've previously used. When first turning it on, I was able to link it to my google account which allowed me to access any apps I already have installed on my Google account. The set up was extremely easy to do, and quick. The battery life on this is great.","Really stylish tablet, its nice and compact. This tablet is very easy to use. Has some great features and brilliant camera. Holds the charge really well. The only down side for me is i cant change the fonts on this tablet its set to only one style. But over all an amazing tablet and highly recommend","This is one of the most user friendly , responsive tablets I have ever had . The functionality is very similar to a phone and has an easy set up . The display is high quality especially on the large screen and there is no lagging from your touch. The sound is crystal clear and allows smooth listening of music and videos. Bit of a con is it is a bit heavy which can be annoying after a while of holding it , and as it has a metal back initially it is cold,  easily resolved with a case.","This tablet is well built with metal case and feels good in hand. Great screen colours when streaming but sound lacking. Surfing feels snappy although reaction to input sluggish. This will not play games with action very well and stutters with content rich games. It is adequate for young family use for internet and media, external storage and case advisable. Google docs work well as long as not to many apps open at once. Quality tablet but lacking in abilities.","A lovely crisp 1920 x 1200 display and surprisingly good audio using two speakers.\nA quick start guide, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFirst Time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 app and a 'TIPS' app gets you quickly up and running. \nVideo, streaming, surfing and apps have performed as they should, it has 2GB of RAM. 32GB storage + option for a SD Card. USB C connection.\nIndividual family profiles, Kids mode, facial recognition & good battery life.\nI would advise a case for viewing and protection.","I am so impressed with this. From opening the box there is minimal wasted packaging. Simply take out if the box, charge and go. Its android which i am familiar with. The screen fills so no wasted borders. The screen is so clear and crisp. Good quality camera and some nice features. Very lightweight. The battery lasts for a long time. The sound quality is fantastic so watching a film in bed has become the new craze in my house. All in all this is a fantastic tablet.","I love the opticore chip \nInternet works very fast and quick response time. \nIt looks stylish and easy to handle. \nThis is are first time using a lenovo product and I'm impressed the only thing I would say as a down side is the 8mp camera still does the job as shown in pictures. I will be recommending to others,\nGreat for game play, video's and music"],"28":["Bought as a replacement for a defunct Kindle.\nVery easy to use and set up.\nBigger than the phone for the Googling in your life.

Up to now I have had a number of 7\" Asus Android tablets.  I like to use them for e-book reading (hence the 7\" book-like size).   Although versatile, these Android  tablets are slow.  I am still amazed how fast the iPad mini 5 is.  The lack of buttons and Apple's filing system takes some getting used to, but you quickly get accustomed to it.  I can strongly recommend this tablet.","A lot quicker than previous ipad mini","Great design. Very quick  and easy to set up at home.","Ipad mini 5 is spot on.

Slightly irritating but it does not detract from my view of the unit.","Works very well, links with my iPhone and viewed video via iPhone hotspot","Easy to use and fast, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moan I got a free pencil with mine for misrepresentation in the ad","Lovely slim iPad lots of different apps and ways to use it \nNew features are very good","Well worth the upgrade from the iPad Mini 4, better in every way except design which unfortunately never changed","Very well built, very robust but not much difference from my mini 2.
