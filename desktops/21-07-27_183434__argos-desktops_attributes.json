            "I always use a certain make when buying desk, but this time they were out of my price range. I choose this desktop for the looks and I am not disappointed.\nCrisp sharp easy setup etc, to much to mention.\nI would recommend this brand name to all my friend who are on the lookout for computer product. With ref to the product quality, I should know within 3 months of use. I would love to come back to update this product",
            "I needed to upgrade my PC and searched for many weeks & read numerous reviews on these PC's. I was tired of wires, so my main criteria was value for money & a wireless mouse & keyboard.\nI went for the middle priced option, for my personal use, rather than using a work laptop. Easy to set up, connected my printer & away we went!\nIt has performed very well to date. I would definitely recommend."
